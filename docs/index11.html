                        Does anyone out there remember Two Gray Squirrels? They were active very early in letterboxing in southern/central Maryland and northern Virginia -- around the late '90s and early 2000s.

                        It's a good idea to post clues the same day you plant the box. 2 weeks later and I can't read my own field notes. All I can say is good luck.
