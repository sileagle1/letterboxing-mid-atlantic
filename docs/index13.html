                        Hi!

I'm new to the list and to letterboxing. I started as
an activity that my 14 years old son and I can do to
get out of the house before we go stir crazy. 

You see, I am also a new homeschooling...

                        I don't know if anyone knows the planters of this letterbox.  I suspect they are no longer active.  Their logbook is a frozen block of ice.  I replaced the bag but it will need more than that.
