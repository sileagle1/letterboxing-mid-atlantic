Eileen,
 
At least 2 Hikers and 1 hound will be there. Possible one more of each. I also copied the Mid-Atlantic list so they can see this too. Thanks!

Despite how I was raised, I suppose New York is not 
the center of the universe hunh?  I'm too far west...

Not sure if I should have done it, but I placed a box last
night in the Philadelphia Zoo.
Clues are posted.
Let me know if you find it.
Please be discreet.

Oh great.
I was going to go look for them.
But if you can't find them and you
hid them, what chance do I have?
Nevertheless, I will give it a go some day
soon, I hope.
