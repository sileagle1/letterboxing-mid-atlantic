                        I've updated the clues to this early letterbox because the small piece of gate marking the location of the box is gone, removed either by persons picking up or, more likely, a crick up its banks....

                        I'm thinking of taking my 84-year-old Dad (Sp1ke) out tomorrow for some drive-bys. He can't walk very far at all, but loves letterboxing. So I'm printing clues to Ken Lockwood Gorge and Starry View.
