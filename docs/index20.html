                        I'm looking into summer footwear for the kids.  Any suggestions for hiking?  Do you have them wear hiking boots, sneakers, or something else?

                        Well yo from Philly everyone,

I've been out of touch working about a gazillion hours a week for the last year or so, only coming up for air occasionally. Anywho, hope all is well, Happy Birthday...

                        I've been thinking of hiding our first box soon...our area doesn't really have that many.  If you are hiding a box in a public park, do you have to ask permission of someone? Thanks!
