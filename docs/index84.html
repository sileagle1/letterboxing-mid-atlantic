                        Hi all,
Hope this note finds all my old boxing buddies well.
Just a note to update you on some replaced boxes and some new ones in 
Green Lane.  
Green Tree Frog and Red Maple are now back and ready...

                        Hello all,
I will be visiting Blue Ash, OH this week and was wondering about 
boxes in that area.  What are some near by parks/boxes that I could 
hunt?
Thanks for any suggestions.

                        Has anyone found a local spot (preferably southeastern PAish) to buy Speedball blades?  I hate to pay $5 for shipping a dozen little blades from an online purchase.  I would rather spend it on gas...

                        Lately I have gotten a ton of e-mails from new boxers, all first-time 
letterboxers, asking for clues, saying they can't find my boxes.

I'm not complaining, just wondering if anyone else has noticed...
