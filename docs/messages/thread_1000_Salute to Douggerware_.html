Douggerware!  Three cheers for a great product.  We went to Tyler<br/>
State park today to do some repairs on my three Elvis boxes planted<br/>
there.  I had a report that one had been muggled so we replaced that<br/>
one.  I also knew that one had been under several inches of ice when I<br/>
checked on it in February and my report from the beginning of April<br/>
was that it was under several inches of water.  Well, it was still<br/>
under water, but it was in great shape.  There was a little leakage<br/>
into the box but I also want to give three cheers to Ziploc freezer<br/>
bags and to double bagging.  I was just able to dry the box out and<br/>
wipe the bags off and plant it in higher grounds, logbook and stamp<br/>
nice and dry.  Great products we use.  The Elvis boxes are ready for<br/>
the next season of boxing visitors.<br/>
