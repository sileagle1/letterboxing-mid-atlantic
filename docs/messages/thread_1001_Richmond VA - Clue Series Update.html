<br/>
The Rooms at Poor Farm Park are all present and accounted for.  I moved <br/>
two boxes to a better hiding place and clarified a few directions.<br/>
<br/>
I will check on the weapons and the suspects in the next few weeks.  I <br/>
know there may be a box or two missing. <br/>
<br/>
I believe the final clues are missing.  I couldn't find them the last <br/>
time I was out there.  If someone found tehm recently let me know.  If <br/>
not, I will replant them soon but in a different place.  If someone <br/>
found the series but not the final clue I could e-mail them the <br/>
directions when they are planted.<br/>
