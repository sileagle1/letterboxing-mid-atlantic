<p>The train has been arriving full of more wonders for our fledgling Circus. A large crowd attracted my attention which I discovered surrounded "Angelina, the Hirsute Beauty" (by TeamTiredFeet). Beautiful, voluptuous, and um, such hair; the bearded lady exhibited the most astonishing detail and attention in her costume and appearance. </p>
<p>Yet we also turned in awe at the commotion offloading the magnificent, "Magical Liberty Horse" (by TeamTiredFeet). Her brushed hair, her flying plumes, simply astounding. I promise you you have never seen any performance finer. </p>
<p>I turned around and thought I had walked into the jungle. I marvel at the courage, fortitude, and skill attaining a great wild "Tiger" (by Girlguides) for our nascent troupe. Men will gape, mothers will gasp and grasp their small wide eyed children. "Gee boss, he sure looks tame to me." "Shushhh." Be not fooled by this Tiger's friendly and docile appearance. I assure you he has sharp teeth, stong legs, and ripping claws. Such excellent guides. </p>
<p>I, and my partner and elephant handler, the inimitable Tempus Fugit, spent this past weekend escorting several of these performances to their temporary home, planted in the forest of Black Hills Regional Park where they are rehearsing even now.  Alas their accomodations are not the best as there is no Douggerware to be had in this area to my knowledge.  </p>
<p>I have heard from some others who are finalizing their performances or are in transit. It is with the greatest anticipation that I await more arrivals. Many thanks for all efforts. </p>
<p>Dress Rehearsals Soon! </p>
<p>Yours most truly and sincerely your humble Ringmaster, </p>
