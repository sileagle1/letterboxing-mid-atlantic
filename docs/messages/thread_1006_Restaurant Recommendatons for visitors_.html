Only 2 more weeks and we'll be in southeast Pennsylvania for a 10-day <br/>
hiking/boxing vacation.  We'll be flying in &amp; out of Philadelphia and <br/>
plan to spend time in the surrounding counties.<br/>

exactly "where" we'll be. Since we'll be moving around a bit, I figured <br/>
any restaurant advice we got would be helpful.  <br/>

As LBug said, we are hoping to meet up w/him to do some hiking/boxing.  <br/>

Are you going to any specific areas? It makes a<br/>
difference.  There's enough good food in any of our <br/>
local areas most of the time that you'd be better off<br/>
sticking with the eateries where you are trekking than<br/>
to make a special trip out of the way for some "name"<br/>
restaurant.  Let me know and I'll get you a rundown on<br/>
some of our gastronomical purveyors.  Also, any<br/>
preference on the TYPE of cuisine ??? <br/>
<br/>
Let me know.<br/>

is close to my home) I can recommend Emily's Pub which is only about 2<br/>
or 3 miles away from the park.  And one of Reading's better known<br/>
casual restaurants is the Peanut Bar which is a few miles further. <br/>
And one of my personal favorites is Bixler's Pub.  <br/>
The ShredMTB boxes at Nolde are a good challenge with very well<br/>
written clues and a decent walk if you plan on doing all three at one<br/>
time.  It actually took us three different visits to find all three.<br/>

If you can give us some restaurant suggestions for these general areas that<br/>

Greetings!<br/>
Are you going to any specific areas? It makes a<br/>
difference.  There's enough good food in any of our<br/>
local areas most of the time that you'd be better off<br/>
sticking with the eateries where you are trekking than<br/>
to make a special trip out of the way for some "name"<br/>
restaurant.  Let me know and I'll get you a rundown on<br/>
some of our gastronomical purveyors.  Also, any<br/>
preference on the TYPE of cuisine ???<br/>
<br/>
Let me know.<br/>
