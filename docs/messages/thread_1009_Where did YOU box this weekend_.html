<div>Well H&amp;H in the form of Irene and Dude went camping in the WV panhandle in Glengary with the Commander Cody Caving Club. On Saturday we boogied northeast and met up with Tree Hugger and her daughter Carrie. Tree Hugger is a real West (By God) Virginia Letterboxer from the Philippi area. We met at Deep Creek State Park in MD and found two great boxes, Meadow Mountain and Swallow Falls. Dude and I would have never found Swallow Falls if it weren't for Tree Hugger and Carrie as the park map and clues seemed to contradict each other and Dude was thoroughly confused. Fortunately Tree Hugger has been boxing for awhile now and her "letterboxing 6th sense" as Silent Doug calls it was working well. We found the box on one of the prettiest trails I have been on in awhile. </div>
<div> </div>
<div>As I've said, Tree hugger is not new to boxing but is not a member of any of the talk lists. I've encouraged her to join our rowdy crew here and assured her a warm welcome.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Dude and I also planted a drive by box off of 81 South in MD, just over the MD/Pa State Line, better known as the Mason Dixon Line. Clues are easy and I'll post to LBNA but basically you get on 81 South, as soon as you cross into MD look on your right for the Maryland Veterans Memorial Highway Monument on the right at Mile Marker 11. Pull off on the right at the monument (basically a 4 foot wall with some flags). Face the writing on the monument and notice the large bush to it's right. Past the bush is a thin tree against the fence leaning against another thin tree on the other side of the fence. On the ground behind the thin tree is our Mason - Dixon box.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Dude and I are pooped, we drove about 16 hours this weekend and have got to unpack and get ready for work tomorrow. Take care all,</div>

we realized we'd only logged three MD boxes and MD's right next to us!<br/>
<br/>
Went by and did the Drive By, Bye Bye Series, Sun Moon &amp; Stars boxes, <br/>
two of the 2 for 1 Bonus Boxes and the Cuppa Joe box.  Boxing for the <br/>
Cuppa Joe was so much fun!  Nothing like combining boxing with a stop <br/>
at a bookstore. : )  Loved all the stamps and all were in good shape!  <br/>
Hopefully we can finish off the Bonus Box series next weekend. : )<br/>

<br/>
Clueless &amp; Skip found the Battle of the Bands: Aerosmith, Bee Gees &amp; <br/>
Mystery Artist in Newtown, PA on Saturday morning.<br/>
<br/>
Then Clueless, Skip &amp; I ambled over towards Ambler &amp; Horsham and logged:<br/>
	Dr. Who #3, #6 &amp; #8<br/>
	Bolts &amp; Holes<br/>
	Memory Cache<br/>
	Terrible Tiger's Tiny Treasure<br/>
	Dog Day Series (all 5)<br/>
	Doc Graeme's Hitchhiker Hostel<br/>
	Ghostly Gathering: Graveyard &amp; Ghostly Gathering: Hanging Miller<br/>
<br/>
Pirate is apparently missing from the Ghostly Gathering series.<br/>
<br/>
Then on Sunday, we stopped off in Franklin Lakes, Wyckoff &amp; Waldwick, NJ, <br/>
and logged:<br/>
	Audubon Nature Center Series (all 3)<br/>
	Wonders of Nature Series: Sting (stamp was missing, possibly due to the <br/>
Brownie Troop who were some of the last visitors) &amp; Paws (and the 3rd box <br/>
in the series was gone altogether).<br/>
	I Smell a Rat<br/>
<br/>
Celery Box is also apparently missing.<br/>
<br/>
I passed by PFX1000 on Sunday, too!<br/>

                    <div id="ygrps-yiv-1247064472">I did the series of four in Waller Mill Park near Williamsburg. Straight<br/>
forward clues, and all present and in good condition.<br/>
<br/>
I found the fourth letterbox and carried it about 50 feet away before<br/>
opening it up. I spread out the letterbox contents in one pile and my<br/>
supplies in a second pile and start stamping. I finish with the log book and<br/>
reach over to put it back in the box when a baby snake, about nine inches<br/>
long, emerges from the leaves about a foot from the piles of letterbox. It<br/>
was probably harmless, but I still used a stick to retrieve the various<br/>
materials and reassemble everything.<br/>
<br/>
The amusing part of this was the spot where I set everything down was random<br/>
and I could have easily put the letterbox on the snake itself, or knelt down<br/>
on the snake. No noise or rustling of any type. It just slithered into view<br/>
and sat there.<br/>
<br/>
It was a lively end to the letterboxing hike.<br/>

                    <div id="ygrps-yiv-763795976">I've been kinda mooping about and lurking lately, But I have been <br/>
getting a few boxes.<br/>
<br/>
Four weekends ago I found two boxes, Pit Stop in Aberdeen, MD, and The <br/>
Wye Island Osage, which is box one of the Wye Island series on Wye <br/>
Island, MD.  The Wye Island Cove box was missing.<br/>
<br/>
Three weekends ago I discovered Fire Sprite in ???, PA, and Waiting in <br/>
Danville, PA.  Both were in fine shape.  During the week I was also <br/>
first finder on both After the -- --- .-. ... . / -.-. --- -.. . in .-. <br/>
. .- -.. .. -. --. --..--, PA and Pateke from New Zealand in Reading, PA.<br/>
<br/>
Two weekends ago I found no boxes :(<br/>
<br/>
But last weekend I was on fire.  I headed up the the Leigh Valley and <br/>
hit up some major boxing on Sunday.  I first found Lessons from the <br/>
Jukebox #10 – The Village People.  I was the first finder, and captured <br/>
the Zymurgy HH for the effort.  I released Zymurgy later in the day. <br/>
Nice stamp, but The Village People still suck :)  I next found some <br/>
Scary Vegetables, four of them for that matter.  I forgot to mention to <br/>
LB, there seems to be a scary vegrant living in the woods near Bad <br/>
Broccoli, one should use caution.<br/>
<br/>
Speaking of Lightn' Bug, I headed over to his place next and bugged him <br/>
a little bit.  He and I headed over to the Lenapi Museum and I found the <br/>
box there.  He showed me where it was really, since I did not expect to <br/>
go for that one and didn't have the clues with me for it.  He also <br/>
showed me where the last box of Fish in Outer Space is.  The box is <br/>
still there, bubt the stamp is gone :( We parted ways as he had a soccar <br/>
game to get to.<br/>
<br/>
I was not done yet.  On the way home I found Tunis Brady (and also <br/>
captured Jenny's Bear HH).  I was not totally sure I was in the right <br/>
park, as the park is not really in the same town the clues say, but the <br/>
clues matched up to what I knew about the particular park so I found it.<br/>
<br/>
Finally I headed down the river a little more and found the Just For Fun <br/>
series.  The first box was no problem.  The second was, interesting. <br/>
The whole area had gotten hit pretty bad by the flood.  Walking along <br/>
the trail I found a canoe hung up in some trees.  I guess the owner had <br/>
found it and couldn't get it out yet, so it was chained to the trees. <br/>
The box was in a tree next to a wall along the side of the path.  The <br/>
path actually leads over the wall.  I clambered down atop a pile of logs <br/>
and wondered, which tree?  the clues said the tree to the right, but <br/>
which right?  The right facing the wall, or the right facing away from <br/>
the wall from the trail.  Just then I looked down and there was the box <br/>
wedged in the roots at my feet :)  The box was a victum of the flood, <br/>
however, and after a quick call to H&amp;H, it was decided to pull it.<br/>
<br/>
Well, that has been my most recent adventures, who knows what I'll go <br/>
after this weekend?<br/>

pointer, and saying, "Now, now, class...")<br/>
"Ramapo" is the name of an escarpment, the mountains it forms, the <br/>
river in the valley next to them, a town in the valley, and the Indian <br/>
tribe that has lived there forever. Not to mention roads, malls, etc. <br/>
in the area. Early spelling was Ramapough.<br/>
The "Ramapo Mountain People" or "Jackson Whites" are reputed to live a <br/>
bit further up the ridge from the State Forest, near and over the <br/>
state line. They are said to be the descendants of the Indians and <br/>
escaped slaves, among other stories. There is an organized group of <br/>
Ramapough Indians up right next to Ringwood State Park. They were in <br/>
the news recently when a trail was closed because paint sludge from <br/>
the old Ford plant was found there. Not sure if or how they relate to <br/>
the other folks.<br/>
(takes of hat, puts down pointer, map rolls itself up and flaps like a <br/>
window shade...)<br/>
As to letterboxing in the area, in addition to the six mentioned, <br/>
there are two others in two other parks on the same ridge, all easily <br/>
accessed from 287. The views are amazing.<br/>

we went to Fredericksburg and got The Bob Box and Out With the Old.  What the heck kind<br/>

seems to have vanished as well.<br/>

Sunday we tackled Dangerous Spys and Evil Women Characters in Great Falls.  Came really<br/>
really close to giving up on the second spy box but I can assure you its alive and well. <br/>
Just wear long pants and delve on in.  Great stamps!  Then off to uncover the Difficult<br/>

boxes though...<br/>

<br/>
Just today managed to get in a bit of boxing for the<br/>
first time since winter descended -- Dr.<br/>
Frankenstein's Letterboxes, of which we could only<br/>
find the first.  We were on the right trail to the<br/>
second one, but I am afraid that the brush off the<br/>
sides of the trail may have grown significantly since<br/>
that box was placed, and couldn't find distinct "piles<br/>
of logs" off either side of the trail.  Found the<br/>
first one with ease, though!  We almost went and did<br/>
the Evil Women Characters boxes but somehow didn't<br/>
have time to today.  Getting quite warm now, it's a<br/>
nice change.<br/>

Dude and I would have never found Swallow Falls if it weren't for <br/>
Tree Hugger and Carrie as the park map and clues seemed to <br/>
contradict each other and Dude was thoroughly confused. Fortunately <br/>
Tree Hugger has been boxing for awhile now and her "letterboxing 6th <br/>

Clues are easy and I'll post to LBNA but basically you get on 81 <br/>
South, as soon as you cross into MD look on your right for the <br/>
Maryland Veterans Memorial Highway Monument on the right at Mile <br/>
Marker 11. Pull off on the right at the monument (basically a 4 foot <br/>
wall with some flags). Face the writing on the monument and notice <br/>
the large bush to it's right. Past the bush is a thin tree against <br/>
the fence leaning against another thin tree on the other side of the <br/>
fence. On the ground behind the thin tree is our Mason - Dixon box.<br/>

&gt; <br/>
&gt; Thanks to the Knights Of Columbo for organizing such a huge All Star <br/>
&gt; collection of boxes.  It will be real interesting to see if someone  <br/>
&gt; attempts to complete this epoch series in one outing. There should <br/>
&gt; be some kind of reward for that!<br/>

&gt; &gt; Well H&amp;H in the form of Irene and Dude went camping in the WV <br/>
&gt; panhandle in Glengary with the Commander Cody Caving Club. On <br/>
&gt; Saturday we boogied northeast and met up with Tree Hugger and her <br/>
&gt; daughter Carrie. Tree Hugger is a real West (By God) Virginia <br/>
&gt; Letterboxer from the Philippi area. We met at Deep Creek State Park <br/>
&gt; in MD and found two great boxes, Meadow Mountain and Swallow Falls. <br/>
&gt; Dude and I would have never found Swallow Falls if it weren't for <br/>
&gt; Tree Hugger and Carrie as the park map and clues seemed to <br/>
&gt; contradict each other and Dude was thoroughly confused. Fortunately <br/>
&gt; Tree Hugger has been boxing for awhile now and her "letterboxing 6th <br/>
&gt; sense" as Silent Doug calls it was working well. We found the box on <br/>
&gt; one of the prettiest trails I have been on in awhile. <br/>
&gt; &gt;  <br/>
&gt; &gt; As I've said, Tree hugger is not new to boxing but is not a member <br/>
&gt; of any of the talk lists. I've encouraged her to join our rowdy crew <br/>
&gt; here and assured her a warm welcome.<br/>
&gt; &gt;  <br/>
&gt; &gt; Dude and I also planted a drive by box off of 81 South in MD, just <br/>
&gt; over the MD/Pa State Line, better known as the Mason Dixon Line. <br/>
&gt; Clues are easy and I'll post to LBNA but basically you get on 81 <br/>
&gt; South, as soon as you cross into MD look on your right for the <br/>
&gt; Maryland Veterans Memorial Highway Monument on the right at Mile <br/>
&gt; Marker 11. Pull off on the right at the monument (basically a 4 foot <br/>
&gt; wall with some flags). Face the writing on the monument and notice <br/>
&gt; the large bush to it's right. Past the bush is a thin tree against <br/>
&gt; the fence leaning against another thin tree on the other side of the <br/>
&gt; fence. On the ground behind the thin tree is our Mason - Dixon box.<br/>
&gt; &gt;  <br/>
&gt; &gt; Dude and I are pooped, we drove about 16 hours this weekend and <br/>
&gt; have got to unpack and get ready for work tomorrow. Take care all,<br/>
&gt; &gt;  <br/>
