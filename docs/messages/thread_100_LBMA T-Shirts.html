                    <div id="ygrps-yiv-472103439"><p>Okay Folks,</p>
<div>Here are the details. T-shirts will be $10 plus $3.85 S&amp;H via priority mail. The T-shirts doc shows you about what it will look like. The color and size details doc let's you know your color options. Sorry the images are so small, it's the best I could do. If you are planning to order I will need to know by this Friday the 28th if possible. Please do not reply to this message, send me a separate one to <a href="mailto:Hikers_n_hounds@..." rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Hikers_n_hounds@...</a>. (that way my stoarge won't get filled up with all of the attachments on the replies). </div>
<div> </div>
<div><u>Important stuff:</u></div>
<ol>
<li>I must have a (total) 75 T-shirt order. If I don't ge enough response I will cancel this project. I am not saying that to encourage you to buy more. I already have one team who wants 10 or something so we should be okay. I am just setting your expectations in case this doesn't fly.</li>
<li>I have asked for and received permission from the LBNA Webmaster for use of the logo on the front of the shirt.</li>
<li>These shirts are NON-RETURNABLE. I work for a wholesaler, not a retailer and these are being custom done. PLEASE, if you are a very particular person this may not be the right source for you to get a T-Shirt. While I have made every effort to make this a quality shirt, everyone's taste's run different. I will inspect every shirt before I ship for defects, but I can't take any back because you don't like the color or the way it fits. Sorry.</li>
<li>These shirts must be pre-paid. I must have your check by Friday June 11th. But first I need you to email telling me how many and what sizes and colors you would like.</li>
<li>I am pretty sure there will be a "Great T-Shirt &amp; Image Exchange" gathering for those who want to avoid S&amp;H costs as well as meet their fellow boxers. I am looking at the last weekend in June in Bucks County PA. Please let me know in your email your thoughts on that. Yes, there will be an event stamp. Sewbizzy has volunteered to carve it.</li></ol>
<div>Ok, I think thats all of the details. If I forgot something I will let you know. This all grew out of me wanting a T-shirt for this new hobby of mine and being too much of a slob for white. I hope this goes well. Thanks again,</div>
