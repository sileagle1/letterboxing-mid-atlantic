<div> </div>
<div>To anyone attending the Boyds, MD gathering this weekend I will have them there. </div>
<div> </div>
<div>To anyone who is new and wondering what the heck I am talking about, the patch is the image on our LBMA home page at yahoo groups. It is $2 and if you are interested in purchasing please email me OFF LIST for further info.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>I hope to see as many as possible at the gathering this weekend. It looks like Tempus Fugit and Scarab have really outdone themselves for our enjoyment. Can't wait!!!!</div>
