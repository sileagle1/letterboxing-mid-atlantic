<p>Detective Grogue informs me that several helpful citizens wish to help solve the dreadful crime of Mr. Boddy's murder. But many are confused by the beauracracy of the local constabulary. </p>
<p>NOTE: To be sure you can play:</p>
<p>- you should bring your own unique clue stamp</p>
<p>- pre-register it with Phineas (thedoubtfulguests at yahoo dot com)</p>
<p>- arrive by high Noon - we plan to play at 1:00pm. Times may change.</p>
<p>There are the 23 or so pre-carved classic Clue clue stamps that may be signed up for on a "first come first served" basis on the day of the gather. (No pre-reservations, sorry.)</p>
<p>The pre-registration of your own carved stamps both helps to ensure their uniqueness and more importantly allows me to pre-print the "Clue Sheets" that everyone needs for checking off the clues and solving the mystery. </p>
<p>Remember that since all of the clues are shuffled and distributed randomly you probably will not end up playing with "your" clue. </p>
<p>Any appropriate Suspect, Weapon, or Place is welcome, especially imaginative ones. Nothing fancy required. I bet you have something lying around the house. </p>
<p>There may be a lot of people, and I assure you it will be most chaotic. </p>
<p>Here are the disturbing clues that we have so far. I cannot for moment believe that any of these could actually be related to the crime. How horrible.</p></font><font face="Times New Roman">
<p>Suspects:<br/>Mr. B. - Penguin Patrol<br/>Miss Outovsight - Team Little Dog<br/>M. Brunette - A man of many talents, many accents - many passports. - Louis d Arc</p>
<p>Weapons:<br/>Scimitar - Gallant Rogue<br/>Horseshoe - Which suspect brings his own horses to the country? - Louis d Arc<br/>Sword (s) - Vargo Clan<br/>Circus Cannon - Vargo Clan</p>
<p>Halloween Pumpkin - <br/><br/>Places:<br/>Wine Cellar - Gallant Rogue<br/>Trophy Room - Had the horses been removed, then replaced? - Louis d Arc<br/>Widows Walk - True Indigo<br/></p></font><font face="Arial" size="2">
<p>Rules in Brief:</p>
<p>All clue stamps are sorted by type, hidden in envelopes, shuffled and the 3 'answers' anonymously removed. </p>
<p>Then all envelopes are shuffled again and passed out to the players who signed up.</p>
<p>Players ask everyone if they "have a clue" and exchange their clue stamps.</p>
<p>Mark off what you find on your clue sheet.</p>
<p>Which </p></font><font face="Times New Roman" size="2">Suspect, Weapon, or Place remain unaccounted for is the "answer"</font><font face="Arial" size="2">.
<p>Make your accusation quietly to the Ringmaster. (We want to keep playing until their are 1st, 2nd, and 3rd.)</p>
<p>A potential winner must show all stamps and that many others have his or her clue as a fairness rule. I will ask for a show of hands. </p>
<p>For excruciating details and updated clue listings see: http://www.atlasquest.com/lboxes/clue.html?boxId=6110</p>
<p>I do hope we can solve the Clues and the Circus get paid, um, I mean and catch the dastardly culprit. ["Boss, who talked you into to doing this again anyway?" "Hussh, never mind."]</p>
<p>Your, nervous until we solve this, but humble, if verboseness, Ringmaster,</p>

<div> </div>
<div>Well, no it is not possible to play if you do not have a clue stamp.  You see if you have no stamp, but only have to collect them from others, than you have an unfair time advantage.  You may certainly collect all the stamps afterwards.  In the past they all ended up on one table.  </div>
<div> </div>
<div>Remember virtually any stamp will do if you use your imagination.  I would not even mind a store bought.  Also there are going to be many extra stamps around.  I just have no idea how many will need a stamp and how many extras there may be.  I personally am pulling several stamps that I have lying around and adding them to the mix.  "The Doubtful Guest" a suspect???</div>
<div> </div>
<div>I thought the cannon idea was very clever too.  </div>
<div> </div>
<div>Looking forward to seeing you.</div>

<div> </div>
<div>I RSVP'd about a Troll stamp earlier today.  Well, I have since carved him.  His name is Buggly.  This is what my son wrote about him:</div>
<div> </div>
<div>"Buggly once was a fairy, like his two brothers, but they were all turned into trolls by an evil sorcerer.  Their wings, however, remain.  Only the fairy/troll's wands will restore them to their original shape, and Buggly will kill to get his."
</div>
<div> </div>
<div>My son and I will just register as one person for this game and work together to solve.  I hope that is okay?  (Would that be unfair?????  If so, I could carve a wand for my son to submit - please let me know.)</div>
<div> </div>
<div>I have attached a photo of Buggly.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Thank you for all you are doing for this game - we can't wait!</div>
<div> </div>
<div>The Wind Was Here</div>
<div>(and my son is Captain X)</div>
