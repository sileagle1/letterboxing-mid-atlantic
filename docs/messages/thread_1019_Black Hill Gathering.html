Thanks for getting the gathering together!!  I didn't know what to <br/>
expect, and it was such a great time!! I am looking forward to the <br/>
next one. How nice to be able to put faces with names.  I will be <br/>
finishing up the circus boxes tomorrow afternoon.  EVERYONE did a <br/>
great job carving!!  I was very impressed with all the great talent.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks again,<br/>
Box-on ya'll<br/>

YOU to Tempus Fugit, Dead Duck Chuck, Claire de Lune, The Doubtful <br/>
Guests, and all others who put together todays event.<br/>
<br/>
It was a pleasure meeting everyone, sharing experiences &amp; stamps, and <br/>
then hunting down all the Circus performers.  We were able to find each <br/>
and every one of Boch's retinue, including the two lions who escaped <br/>
their cage and were prowling around the Black Hills.  The carvings were <br/>
outstanding and the extra effort to hunt them down was well worth <br/>
it.  :)<br/>
<br/>
We look forward to catching-up with you on the trail!<br/>
Box-on<br/>

PS -- on our way out of the Park @ 7:30 as the last rays of sun were <br/>
dipping below the tree line and the heavy rains were starting, we <br/>
passed our new Rhode Island friends Wanda and Pete were heading deeper <br/>
into the woods in search of Boch's friends!</div>
