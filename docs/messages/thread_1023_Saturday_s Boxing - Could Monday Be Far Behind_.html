<br/>
I hope that everybody had a blast at the deuling gatherings (cur the <br/>
banjo music...).<br/>
<br/>
Turtle McQuade and I met up in extreme Northeast PA to hunt a <br/>
mystery box and visit some cute churches.  We had been discussing <br/>
meeting up at the NY gathering, but we both came tot he conclusion <br/>
that we did not want to subject our kiddos to 4 hour drives each way <br/>
(well, NY was 2.25 hrs for me.<br/>
<br/>
So we decided to split the pain (more on that later) and meet in <br/>
Susquehanna County, PA.  Lone Wolf and Feisty Kitty joined Kirby <br/>
Rider as the kid part of our squad.  Our goal was to perform a <br/>
resuce mission on her "June Bloom" Hitchhiker which had been <br/>
languishing in Silent Doug's Stone Face mystery box since late <br/>
2003.  The rescue was successful and the poor helpless isolated HH <br/>
was rescued.  The box is in good shape.<br/>
<br/>
Our efforts turned to NJ Caroles "Equinunk Charge" Series - a series <br/>
of 5 drive by's located on the grounds of charming little churches <br/>
about 15-25 miles N of Honesdale, PA.  We got to Pine Mill UMC - a <br/>
cute stone building whose masonry was created on site (according to <br/>
the older gentleman we chatted with) back in the 1940's.  Found the <br/>
box and then went for lunch in Equinunk.  After lunch we did the <br/>
Equinunk UMC and I dislocated my left shoulder retrieving the box <br/>
(the kids did not want to reach under the Juniper bushes to get <br/>
it!).  After it popped back in and we did the boxing thing.  Turtle <br/>
retrieved the Greyhound 2 HH to bring back to NY.  We then went on <br/>
to the Union UMC and saw the largest Pine Tree (diameter, not <br/>
height) that we had ever seen.  From there the Lookout UMC and <br/>
finally the Braman UMC.<br/>
<br/>
We also did much exchanging, cross stamping, etc. over lunch.  There <br/>
was a birthday party for a 90 yr old lady going on near us and they <br/>
were all wodnering what those weird people were doing with those <br/>
stamps and books....<br/>
<br/>
On Monday, I hope to catch up with Pete and Wanda in Central PA to <br/>
find some mystery boxes of the Mapsurfer and True Indigo variety.<br/>
<br/>
Take care,<br/>
