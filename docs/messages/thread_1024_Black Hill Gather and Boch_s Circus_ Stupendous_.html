turned out to make this gather such a tremendous success?! Thank you <br/>
all for bringing food and drink and paper plates and ice; for <br/>
cleaning up so well that the pavilion looked better than it did when <br/>
I got there in the morning; for helping haul the many bags of trash <br/>
out of the park. You all made my "job" as host a piece of cake. All <br/>
I did was rent a pavilion -- you guys made it an Event. Letterboxers <br/>
rock!<br/>
<br/>
Many thanks to my co-hosts and good friends, The Doubtful Guests, <br/>
who talked me into thinking a spring gather was a good idea (you <br/>
were right!). Take a bow Scarab/Phineas Boch! Your Circus brainstorm <br/>
was the big draw to this event. May it have many happy travels to <br/>
entertain and amaze the letterboxing masses around the country. A <br/>
huge thank you to all the circus stamp carvers who volunteered their <br/>
time considerable talent: there wouldn't have been much of show <br/>
without your generosity.<br/>
<br/>
A final thank you to my better half, Dead Duck Chuck, who slaved <br/>
over a hot grill in the sun when he could have been out on the Bay <br/>
fishing. :)<br/>
<br/>
And, yes, I would gladly do it again!<br/>
