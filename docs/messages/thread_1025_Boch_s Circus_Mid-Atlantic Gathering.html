<div> </div>
<div>We were totally amazed at the beauty and intricacy of all the stamps.  Each box was so exciting!  </div>
<div> </div>
<div>Once again I have to say that letterboxers are among the friendliest people I've ever met.  So glad we got to meet so many of you and to see others we've met before.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Thanks again for giving us a fabulous performance!</div>
