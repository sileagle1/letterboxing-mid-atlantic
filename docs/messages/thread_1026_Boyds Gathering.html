 The gathering was a wonderful experience filled with beautiful<br/>
stamps, convivial company, good food and a beautiful park.  I camped<br/>
for three days at Little Bennett and was able to add 34 boxes to my<br/>
counts. Even a Saturday evening thunderstorm didn't dampen the fun,<br/>
just gave me an excuse to get caught up on some sleep after boxing<br/>
till 11 PM on Friday night - my first experience with night boxing<br/>
where I learned a few things for the next night experience.  For<br/>
example, it is really hard to hold a flashlight while stamping in and<br/>
it is even harder to find a trail in the dark once you wander off of<br/>
it to find the box.<br/>
As I sit here looking at the stamps to log my finds I am again amazed<br/>
at the quality of the carvings.  I have found a lot of beautiful<br/>
stamps in this hobby, but never so many in one area.  Nice job to all<br/>
of the carvers.<br/>
And a special thank you to our hosts and hostesses - Tempus Fugit,<br/>
Dead Duck Chuck, Scarab and Night Owl.  I can't think of anything that<br/>
would have improved the experience.  I can't repeat enough how<br/>
wonderful everything was.  <br/>
Thank you, thank you, thank you<br/>
