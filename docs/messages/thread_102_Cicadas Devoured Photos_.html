Well, you got the forrester part right!  <br/>
Maroon vs Red  <br/>
"sewbusy" vs "sewneat"   <br/>
G St Arlington vs G St Rockville<br/>
1 outta 4, no cigar<br/>
<br/>
Sew - as needle &amp; thread, you got<br/>
Sow - as in yard work - starting stuff from seed<br/>
Bizzy - as in I can't spell<br/>
<br/>
Sorry you didn't make it to Patapsco - maybe our paths will cross <br/>
soon.<br/>

a chance to try out the store because it's closed on Sundays.  <br/>
Actually, no one who had signed the log at that time (I think there <br/>
were 3 of us) had been there when the store was open.  I'll get back <br/>
up there at some point, though.  It looked great through the window!<br/>
