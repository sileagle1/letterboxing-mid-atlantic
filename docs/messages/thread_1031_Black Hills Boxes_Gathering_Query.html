<br/>
Sorry we missed you. <br/>
<br/>
Hot Ding was a mystery box listed on Atlas Quest by true indigo<br/>
<br/>
Angscioso La Grandioso was carved by the Pepe's. I think it is a <br/>
traveling event stamp, but could be a mystery stamp also. Best to <br/>
ask them. If you find out, please let me know. I was wondering how <br/>
to classify that one as well.<br/>
<br/>
Boch Circus (the elephant with sign) was an event stamp<br/>
<br/>
The Lion Tamer I am unsure of this one. It didn't make its way into <br/>
my logbook.<br/>
<br/>
Hope this helps some.<br/>

Angscioso La Grandioso (by Marco Peperini), the elephant (my baby) and <br/>
the Lion Tamer (donated by an anonymous carver) are all part of Boch's <br/>
Circus and will be packed up on June 1st for the first leg of their <br/>
journey.<br/>

<div>Ahhhh, stamps at events cause so many problems with letterboxing "counting".  One can easily argue that if the box is somehow "hidden" you should count it as a "(F)ind".  If it is an event stamp then it is clearly an (E)vent stamp.  If it is just laying out on the table, like traveling event stamps often are, well....
