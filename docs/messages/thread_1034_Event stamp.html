my event stamp was called "Box the Gathering".  My logbook seemed to <br/>
have gotten separated from the stamp, but I think people at least got <br/>
to stamp the stamp in their books. Sure was a fun day.  I enjoyed <br/>
meeting everyone and exchanging.<br/>
<br/>
Energizer Bunnie and I are interested in boxing through SouthEastern <br/>
Pennsylvania this summer, but there are no campsites for a pop-up <br/>
camper near those state parks.  ANyone know any private campgounds in <br/>
the area?<br/>

Don't think we met and I missed your event stamp, however I did have <br/>
fun completing your Zodiac Series backwards! Just as Cyclonic snd I <br/>
were emerging from the woods having completed Boch's Series Three, we <br/>
had the extreme good fortune to meet North Carolina's Penguin Patrol <br/>
who were looking for Deano's Capricorn. We joined in! Liz's son was <br/>
running after the boxes... we just had to stamp! I never boxed with <br/>
little kids before.... can you really train them to fetch boxes? <br/>
Anyway we picked up Bryan's Aquarious then got them started on series <br/>
three... then Cyclonic and I worked your clues backwards thru the <br/>
first four and back to the contact station. Worked out great! Good <br/>
clues, good stsmps everything in good shape.... but there were no <br/>
mushrooms in thst big stump!</div>

</span></blockquote>Bummer you missed the mushrooms, they are quite a site.  I think it is <br/>
the wrong time of year.  A little farther past the Zodiac series and <br/>
you could have colled my "Box-on" stamp.  Energizer Bunnie and I are <br/>
thinking of hiding the event stamp and logbook just for the fun of it.  <br/>
So, you'll have to come back this way for more boxing.<br/>
<br/>
The kids fetching boxes can be great.  My kids love boxing, but I have <br/>
seen 2 snakes while boxing just this week.  Hope it is not s sign that <br/>
they will be a problem this year. Seen any in your neck of the woods <br/>
this year??<br/>
