<br/>I intended it to be a rotating series, where I would have a series out for a year and then replace it with a new series.  I'm just a little slow in replacing it with a new series.

<br/>I removed all of the boxes.  Do not attempt to find them because they are not there.

Did I hear that you found Scooby part 6???  Just wondering how you <br/>
managed - I took the clues down becaus the code was so badly off and <br/>
havent had a chance to fix them yet... If it gives too much away, <br/>
please email me off list -  <a href="mailto:justplaingeorge@..." rel="nofollow" target="_blank">justplaingeorge@...</a><br/>
