                    <div id="ygrps-yiv-1967562612">Did anybody visit Winged Victory last week? Last Sunday, after a <br/>
failed attempt to get in Seneca Park (Van Gogh LB) before it<br/>
opened... <br/>
without a map or any real idea of where I was going... I started out <br/>
after "Winged Victory". After exiting off the interstate I went back <br/>
and forth looking for Comus Road for about a half hour before giving <br/>
up and going back to Boyd's and Boch's Circus Series Three. After <br/>
looking at a map, I realized I was on Comus Road the whole time I was <br/>
looking for it! (SLap head here)<br/>
<br/>
Well I had a great day regardless... finding all of series three and <br/>
the zodiac series with Cyclonic... the despite the warnings that it <br/>
was TOOO long ... I went and found all of The Birder series (Yes #2<br/>
is <br/>
there...! Try looking in from the uphill side of the tree) It is 3 <br/>
plus miles of pristine trail and there are a couple of hills... but <br/>
this ranks as one of my all time favorite LB hikes (Thank you Tempes <br/>
Fugit)<br/>
<br/>
So is there any interest in meeting at the Winged Victory LB for a <br/>
little picnic and mini gather next Saturday the 28th?..</div>

June... maybe we hold the Picnic at Mount Olympus in conjunction with <br/>
a Circus moving day party... we could help pull a series or two... I'm <br/>
sure they would appreciate the help.<br/>

Let's coordinate with Phineas Boch on this!!!</div>
