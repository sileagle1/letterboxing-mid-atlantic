                    <div id="ygrps-yiv-171288167">I just checked on one of my older boxes "Battle Of The Old Mill."  It seems they have <br/>
dumped a load of stone on the site and a ground hog has taken up residence.  It would <br/>
only be accessible with digging and I haven't had the ground hog tested for rabies yet.<br/>
<br/>
I have pulled the clue(s) for now [Not that anybody bothered trying]  and will advise on <br/>
possible future re-location.<br/>
