                    <div id="ygrps-yiv-1972981966">Hi All,<br/>
<br/>
Had some fun with Wisconsin Hiker (Debbie) and Martini Man (John) <br/>
yesterday.  Jan if Team Little Dog joined us for a bit of a futile <br/>
attempt as well.<br/>
<br/>
After the hardy Wisconsinites (or Wisconsonians or Wisconsoners, I <br/>
am not certain) logged like 15+ miles (and untold many boxes) on <br/>
Saturday at French Creek and Blue Marsh, they continued to dazzle <br/>
with their hiking stamina!!<br/>
<br/>
We did the Nolde Forest Series and tried for Mapsurfer's Old Ned's <br/>
Mexican Beer.  We were able to make it about 50% through the clues <br/>
when we hit an impasse and started trying all sorts of directions, <br/>
etc.  Having already done Nolde, Jan joined us for the last Shred <br/>
MTB box and then for the confuzzled attempt at Mapsurfer.  We <br/>
evenutally gave up on that one, but have a strategery for future <br/>
attempts.  We then had some time for exchanges, etc.  Jan went off <br/>
to see an Elvis entertainer with her fiance, while WH and MM and I <br/>
bebopped over to find the Pateke Letterbox.<br/>
<br/>
After that, we employed my geek toy (GPS) to find a LB/Geocahe <br/>
hybrid in the Berks County Cemetary - The "Sacred Garden" - I can <br/>
provide "boxy" clues for those interested and nto GPS enabled.<br/>
<br/>
From here it was off to find some ... and .-. and Jan's box "After <br/>
the .-.- .--..".<br/>
<br/>
There is a new type of Magnetism in Penn's Woods - In addition <br/>
to "Tick Magnets", we now have "Inchworm Magnets", as Berks County <br/>
woods were full of them, just waiting to land on Martini Man.<br/>
<br/>
At the end of the day, it was time to imitate John Candy in "Trains, <br/>
Planes and Automobiles."  I then peeled off the boots, found 3 <br/>
blisters, said in a satisfied tone "Man, my dawgs are barkin'"  <br/>
Found a tick cruising across my chest at shower time and decided to <br/>
estimate our mileage.  Nolde - 10 miles, Patake 3/4 miles, LB/Geo - <br/>
1/2 mile, -.-.- - 3 miles, Jan's -.-.. - 1/4 mile, for a rousing <br/>
estimate of 14.5 miles.  No wonder my dogs are stil barking.<br/>
<br/>
Today, we shall meet Gerania up at Hickory Run, to Mapsurf again!<br/>
<br/>
Got Bunny Maps?<br/>
<br/>
We do,<br/>

even better if he'd plant some more boxes (wink wink, nudge nudge)! :)<br/>

                    <div id="ygrps-yiv-1626556142">"Sacred Garden" is listed on a geocache website because the planter <br/>
is more of a geocaher than a letterboxer.  It is considered a hybrid <br/>
because it does allow you to trade stamp images as you would with any <br/>
letterbox, and it does not have any of the typical geostuff in it.  <br/>
In that regard it is more like a LB, but its coordinates require a <br/>
GPS or a good topo map to find.  There are several mystery boxes like <br/>
that, espcially when you get to the crux of some mapsurfer boxes.<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, the cemetery it is in is actually more of a potters field, a <br/>
term coined by Martini Man that I'd forgotten.<br/>

Yes, it is an unusual and quite cemetery, I had never really thought too <br/>
much about it, though I pass by it just about every day.  Should prove <br/>
to be a nice, quick drive-by at some point this week.<br/>
