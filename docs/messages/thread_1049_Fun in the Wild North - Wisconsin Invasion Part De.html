for some Hickory Run Hairy Legging.  More Mapsurfers were on the <br/>
docket, such as Hickory Trail Run and Hickory "O" Run.  Both were <br/>
found and Martini Man enjoyed the Orienteering aspect of the latter <br/>
box.  Perhaps a new hobby....  These were well aged boxes from 1999, <br/>
last centuru.  It was almost Darmoorian!<br/>
<br/>
We hopped over to Pocono International to find New Jersey Carole's <br/>
Long John Letterbox.  Cool Stamp, but we were expecting something <br/>
eponymous!  ;-)  Picked up the Bum-Bee Hitchhiker as well.<br/>
<br/>
We bopped back top Natty Bumppo's Nescopeck Butterfly in the same <br/>
park.  We were second to find, after Riversol.<br/>
<br/>
Gerania and I had to head back to our families, but it is rumored <br/>
that the Wisconsin Hikers were going vulture hunting.<br/>

Well, tomorrow it is back to the job.  Thanks for the fun, Wisconsin <br/>

                    <div id="ygrps-yiv-534099484">Ah yes, but it meant scrambling across a boulder field and bushwhack <br/>
to the other box.  And Gerania was wearing sneakers.  Robust ones at <br/>
that, but still sneakers.<br/>
<br/>
The other boxes were more normal.<br/>
<br/>
Fear not the wilds of the Poconos, they're only just a tad more <br/>
rugged than Allentown!  ;-)<br/>
