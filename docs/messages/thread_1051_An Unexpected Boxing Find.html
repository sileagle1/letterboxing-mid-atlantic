<br/>
My boxing son, Kirby Rider, did something similar at the Academy of <br/>
Natural Sciences in Philly.  The stamps were animals, and they <br/>
provide you with a card.  It is part of a maze exhibit.<br/>

&gt; OK, on second thought it's east(ish), to the right of the entrance. <br/>
&gt; Or, as I'm fond of saying to my left handed son who naturally wants <br/>
&gt; to reach left, turn left, "It's on the right. No, the other right". <br/>
&gt; He hates when I say that.<br/>

&gt; &gt; Coolcool.  Thank you, Gillian.  I'll have to look for those as <br/>
well <br/>
&gt; &gt; when I go back in the autumn.  It's nice that while an <br/>
organization <br/>
&gt; &gt; like Longwood Gardens would activly Not want boxes hidden on the <br/>
&gt; &gt; grounds, they have offered a reasonable alternative which adds a <br/>
&gt; little <br/>
&gt; &gt; bit of fun and adventure to what could be an otherwise tiring, <br/>
and <br/>
&gt; for <br/>
&gt; &gt; the younger contingent, boring visit.<br/>

&gt; &gt; &gt; There's also a series for children on one of the nature trails <br/>
&gt; west, <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; I think, of the main entrance. Past the annual garden, not as <br/>
far <br/>
&gt; as <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; the large fountain.<br/>
