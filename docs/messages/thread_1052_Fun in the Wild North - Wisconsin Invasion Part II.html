<br/>
We had a great time with Lightin' Bug and Jan of Team Little Dog on <br/>
Sunday and then Lbug and Gerania93 on Monday.  It was nice to meet such <br/>
friendly local boxers!  We're still hoping to hook up with a few others <br/>
this weekend (I'll be calling you soon).<br/>
<br/>
Today we decided to postpone or trip to the Delaware Water Gap due to <br/>
the weather.  Instead we had a lot of fun exploring the Allentown parks <br/>
and searching for boxes.  The only one we looked for and couldn't find <br/>
was "Fish in Outer Space #1".  Here's all the rest we found, and all <br/>
were in good shape:<br/>
<br/>
General Trexler<br/>
Pass, Set, Spike<br/>
Allentown Rose Garden<br/>
Yocco's Box<br/>
The Village People<br/>
Robin Hood's Hat<br/>
Fish in Outer Space #2<br/>
419<br/>
Lenape Museum<br/>
Fibonacci Treegnometree<br/>
South Mountain Series (Spring Peeper, Mountain Laurel, S. Mtn HHH)<br/>
Tom's Alien Spaceship<br/>
Doctor Who #4<br/>
<br/>
We had the special excitement of finding the Lance Armstrong hitchhiker <br/>
in the Fibonacci box! We had the pleasure of taking him to his final <br/>
destination at the Hitchhiker Hostel.  His race is over and he is <br/>
relaxing there now.<br/>
<br/>
Have to go and get something to eat now after all that boxing...<br/>
