<div>Hi all,</div>
<div>I managed to plant my "Fun @ Knoebels" box last weekend.</div>
<div>I only carved it 11 months ago.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Took my two youngest (girls) there for a day of riding and night of camping.</div>
<div>Once my nine year old finally got up the nerve to try Twister, she was hooked.</div>
<div>Then she had to try the Phoenix.  A speed junkie was born.</div>
<div>We went on both at least 5 times, non stop.</div>
<div>My old back is killing me.</div>
<div>Clues are posted.</div>
<div>Is that considered Northumberland County?  Hope so.</div>
<div>See you somewhere.</div>

Sometimes in the evening if there was no one waiting the ride operators would just let us go through twice without ever getting out.</div>

<div>Sadly back surgery has ended my roller coaster days. But I sure have great memories!<br/><br/><b><i>trainear@...</i></b> wrote:</div>
