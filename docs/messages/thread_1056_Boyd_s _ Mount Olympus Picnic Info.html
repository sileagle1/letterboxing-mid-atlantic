Yuri Nahl seeing some of the circus acts we missed.  (when I last tried for <br/>
SWAK, it had just rained and the whole area was flooded).<br/>
<br/>
We'll be there either Sun or Mon, so I'd love the picnic details!  Thanks.<br/>

<br/>
I can bring Animal Crackers and Vaudeville Moon which were at the <br/>
gather but did not get planted.  I will also bring Flea Circus Clown <br/>
that has arrived for future travels.  Plus a few assorted PLBs.<br/>
<br/>
I understand we could meet and park at Black Hills and carpool over to <br/>
Sugar Loaf's limited parking.  <br/>
<br/>
Sunday? When?<br/>

We did not perceive commitment and didnt want to be <br/>
pushy ...Sewsowbusy and myself proceeded... but I saw the Doubtful <br/>
Guests and Claire de Lune, Deceased Duck Charles and Tempus Fugit had <br/>
already been all over that Mountain! Sorry we couldn't all go<br/>
together <br/>
this time. Had I seen your post it would have swayed our decision. Ms <br/>
Sewsowbusy took some photos that may actually be worthy of Project X. <br/>
We had a great day...</div>
