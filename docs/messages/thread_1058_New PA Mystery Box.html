</span></blockquote>First, let me say I am a big fan of Amanda from Seattle.  I dig her clues very much.  I mean <br/>
no disrespect to her in any way.<br/>
<br/>
That said...<br/>
<br/>
The whole "Atlas Quest - Premium Members Only" thing really rubbed me the wrong way.  <br/>
I don't have a specific set of reasons why.  It just seems contrary to my idea of <br/>
letterboxing.  By this, I don't mean how Amanda wrote that posting, I mean the concept of <br/>
"Premium Clues/Members Only" in general.<br/>
<br/>
How do you all feel about this?  I'm not looking to flame Amanda.  I'm just interested how <br/>
and why others feel on this topic so I can get my head straight on it too.<br/>
<br/>
Is this the future of letterboxing?  Pay-to-play?  Will we eventually be registering our credit <br/>
cards on sites with monthly fees like porn sites?  [So I hear.]<br/>
<br/>
I'm verklempt!  Discuss amongst yourselves...<br/>

<div>Personally I'm just impressed that you can spell "verklempt".  Very impressive..............I must say. </div>
<div> </div>
<div>I have to admit, I joined premium so I could get the clues to a couple of boxes. Knowing my usual rebelious personality, I am kind of amazed that it doesn't bother me. I think for the most part, it's a matter of people wanting to protect certain boxes from the general population. Maybe they put a LOT of work into them, or they are in an area that needs to be dealt with by someone who is more likely to be as responsible as possible? </div>
<div> </div>
<div>I have a friend in Colorado who is putting a HUGE amount of work into a mystery series that she's doing, and she is the empress of crafts. From what she's been telling me and from what I have seen of her various creations over the years, these boxes and stamps are going to be awesome. She's making the logbooks, making lots of different things for different treasure chests. She's going to list them for premium members only because she put so much work into them and wants them to be as safe as possible. </div>
<div> </div>
<div>I tend to think most people are doing it for reasons along those lines. I kind of don't blame them. </div>

They're great people who in spite of their reputations in this hobby are down to earth, friendly and helpful. And what's best about this hobby is that folks can do what they want, however they want. </div>
<div> </div>
<div>I see this as a tool to sell their premium service on their site. I don't have a problem with it, it's thier site, their box, their clues. I choose not to spend the money because I feel I already spend enough money on letterboxing and won't pay for clues. But I'm not offended, just cheap! Plus, I stink at mystery boxes so my money would be wasted.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>I've said this before, as a software trainer who works on computers all damn week I love the simplicity of LBNA. I have joined Atlas Quest and think it's a great site, but I always go to LBNA first. If that makes me a Minor League boxer, in the words or someone else not me, then so be it. I've got nothing to prove to anyone, I'm just having a great time.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>I'm not gonna stress if I'm not included in everything, WOM, Mystery Boxes, etc. There are so many new boxers planting some great stuff, as well as my homies here on LBMA, I've got plenty to keep me busy and happy. </div>
<div> </div>
<div>If Amanda and Ryan want to promote their premium service with a special box I think it's a perfect letterboxing marketing tool. But I will not pay for clues, just a personal decision. But good luck!<br/><br/><b><i>nattybumppolbna &lt;NattyBumppoLBNA@...&gt;</i></b> wrote:</div>

                    <div id="ygrps-yiv-2081374524">Wow - that sounds impressive.  But isn't that part of the joy of doing the thing?  That you <br/>
make this wonderful thing and let it go off into the the uncertain world?  Maybe that's just <br/>
me and my letterboxing values.<br/>
<br/>
Don't we all put a tremendous amount of time in on these boxes?  Maybe not all of them, <br/>
of course, the world needs drive-bys, too.  But is a box better or more special because we <br/>
pay for it?  I may not have cool logbooks, but I've spent days planning and walking-off <br/>
clues.  I've been working on Murder By Numbers for months.  I'm staring down coyotes <br/>
now, too.  If we're going to be paying for them, what are the criteria for the "better" boxes?<br/>
<br/>
There are two things that are sticking in my craw on this.<br/>
<br/>
1.  Newbies got credit cards, too.  Ability to pay is no gauge of letterboxing ability, <br/>
courtesy, or common sense.  I know a guy who is a snowboarding instructor.  He says he <br/>
always knows who will be taken off the mountain in the ambulance.  It's usually the guy <br/>
who is wearing the brand new expensive snowboarding clothes and is carrying the most <br/>
expensive snowboard made - to his first lesson.<br/>
<br/>
2.  If I am paying for the clue, don't you owe something?  Like a guarantee the box is <br/>
going to be there?  What am I getting for my cash?  A peek at precious prose?<br/>
<br/>
I don't want to sound like I am ranting against this.   I haven't made up my mind yet.  It's a <br/>
pretty simple thing to set up a commercial letterboxing site.  Heck, Yahoo will do it for you <br/>
- just add clues.  I guess we could all do that for our clues, if the game goes that way.  But <br/>
as Luke, Leia, Han, Obi-Wan and, I suspect, Chewbacca have all said, "I've got a bad feeling <br/>
about this."<br/>

I see the hiding of a "Premium Member Only" box as a reward for those <br/>
folks who already signed up for Premium Membership. They are really <br/>
paying for Ad-free message boards and <br/>
No banner ads on AtlasQuest hosted clues. When I plant a Premium <br/>
Member only box, it is a sort of "thank you" to those folks. I could <br/>
have just made it a Postal Letterbox and mailed it around to <br/>
everybody...but that would have cost everybody a couple of dollars <br/>
(in addition to what they already paid for premium membership) and it <br/>
would have taken forever! This way I can plant a variety of <br/>
Letterboxes in several different states for Premium members to find <br/>
at their leisure. <br/>
<br/>
No biggie. I also welcome the different points of view and the <br/>
discussion that has arisen from the Baaaa Humbug Box. <br/>
<br/>
I hope that the premium members of AtlasQuest will protect the <br/>
integrity of the clues and not be swayed by bribery or blackmail :-)<br/>
into releasing them others. Please treat this box as any other <br/>
mystery box. Be discreet!<br/>

                    <div id="ygrps-yiv-1106193125">I wasn't aware that there is an overabundance of ads<br/>
on either the Yahoo! LBMA group site, nor on the <br/>
Letterboxing North America pages. In fact, the only<br/>
thing that seems like a blatant commercial to me is <br/>
the infusion in THIS group of an ad to go premium on<br/>
Atlas Quest. A genuine service to the upper echelon <br/>
on AQ would be to notify them directly about the<br/>
placement of this new mystery box.  No, the only<br/>
reason <br/>
I can see that this ad was placed in our group<br/>
messages was to sell a product.  Were this not the<br/>
case, and, <br/>
as you say, it is a service to your paying customers,<br/>
then why not send a group email to all of them<br/>
directly?  <br/>
I find it ironic that in getting the message out to<br/>
your "Premium" members that there is a new box, you<br/>
are <br/>
using a venue that is not deemed worthy of your<br/>
talents.  Kind of like a stewardess on an airliner<br/>
telling the <br/>
passengers in coach what kind of champagne is being<br/>
served in First Class (just in case they're<br/>
interested). <br/>
<br/>
And just to be clear here, when one blows a tank of<br/>
gas and a full day of driving and hiking to find <br/>
one or two stamps, it ain't about the money.  The joy<br/>
of this activity is the serendipity of it all.<br/>
Sometimes the most straightforward and simplest of<br/>
clues unexpectedly yields an elegantly detailed stamp <br/>
that was clearly crafted over many hours or days.<br/>
Other times, the writing of the clues itself is the<br/>
thing,<br/>
and the store-bought stamp at the conclusion is just a<br/>
reverse means to an end.  But you know what?  <br/>
I never doubt the sincere intentions of the person who<br/>
created that box for my anonymous enjoyment... <br/>
That is what I love about Letterboxing.  And I<br/>
treasure its inclusiveness and that it is not<br/>
exclusive.<br/>
<br/>
Oh, and for the record . . . I am not above bribery<br/>
and blackmail. I also will accept graft, <br/>
influence peddling, slush fund contributions, payola,<br/>
hush money, and any kind of payoffs.<br/>

like to restrict access to certain boxes, and the concept wasn't<br/>
initially even my idea. I was chatting with others who didn't want<br/>
*everyone* looking for certain boxes and ways to limit access. WOM<br/>
clues are the defacto way of doing that. Some people make really<br/>
crypic clues to reduce the numbers. I prefer putting my boxes on<br/>
hellishly long hikes to discourage people. (Or encourage them to go<br/>
for a real hike, depending on your point of view!) I've just provide<br/>
yet another option in the form of Premium Member Only boxes. Now you<br/>
don't have to create complex clues to scare people off nor do they<br/>
have to keep giving the clue out directly to people who might be<br/>
interested.<br/>
<br/>
I've spent thousands of hours and hundreds of dollars developing Atlas<br/>
Quest. Premium Membership was just a method to help compensate me for<br/>
the time and money I've invested into it, but I believe that<br/>
letterboxing--at its most basic--should be free. By default, all clues<br/>
on AQ are freely available. In most cases, there's no reason why<br/>
anyone should ever have to pay for a clue--there's almost always a<br/>
letterbox available with a freely available clue you can find instead.<br/>
<br/>
There are only about 50 letterboxes listed on Atlas Quest that require<br/>
premium membership--out of over 6,000. Less than 1%. It's not a<br/>
money-maker by any stretch of the imagination. Most boxes listed as<br/>
PMOs are listed that way because the person who planted it only wants<br/>
"serious letterboxers" looking for them. Those who are serious enough<br/>
about the hobby that they are willing to help pay for improvements. Or<br/>
at least cut out the "fly-by-nighters" who might be less inclined to<br/>
replace a box as well as it should be replaced.<br/>
<br/>
It sounds to me like some people find it offensive that they can't<br/>
have all the clues immediately accessible at all times. Some people<br/>
get twisted out of shape about WOM clues for the same reason. They<br/>
don't want to have "connections" to get clues--they just want them<br/>
handed out, for free, on websites that other people pay for out of<br/>
their own pockets. LbNA is a pretty good gig--hosting that website<br/>
isn't free, and the people who run it are paying for it out of their<br/>
own pockets. And have been for years. It's remarkable--it's rare to<br/>
find such a selfless website and I think sometimes people forgot how<br/>
unusual such a setup really is.<br/>
<br/>
In any case, I've designed Atlas Quest with the intention that<br/>
letterboxing is more-or-less a free hobby, and it will always stay<br/>
that way. Over 99% of the clues are still freely accessible, and the<br/>
ones that aren't were set up that way by the person who listed the<br/>
clue--not Atlas Quest. If you don't have access to 1% of the clues, so<br/>
what? Look for the other 99% of the boxes that are listed. Keep in<br/>
mind, though, on Atlas Quest, it's the premium members that are paying<br/>
for you being able to access those other 99% of the clues at no<br/>
charge. It's the premium members who are paying for improvements to<br/>
the site that *everyone* benefits from.<br/>
<br/>
Premium membership has its benefits, but the vast majority of Atlas<br/>
Quest is completely accessible by everyone for free. Also keep in mind<br/>
that your lunch today probably cost more than a month of premium<br/>
membership would. At less than ten cents a day, it's hardly a barrier<br/>
to anyone who decides they really want a clue bad enough. And if you<br/>
don't, you have that option--look for the other 99% of boxes that are<br/>
listed instead.<br/>
<br/>
Amanda wanted to place a few Premium Member Only boxes as a thank you<br/>
to those who have supported Atlas Quest because she knows first hand<br/>
the amount of effort and money that goes into it. As a thank you to<br/>
premium members, it's sensible to make the clue available to *only*<br/>
premium members. After all, that is who the boxes are intended for!<br/>
<br/>
Now as Mark would say, get out there and box. There's plenty of clues<br/>
available regardless of whether or not you're a premium member on AQ. =)<br/>

&gt; &gt; &gt; This befuddles me, but then again, I am kind of<br/>
&gt; &gt; new to this.  Why <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; would someone charge a fee to find his/her box? Am<br/>
&gt; &gt; I missing <br/>
&gt; &gt; something?<br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; I see the hiding of a "Premium Member Only" box as a<br/>
&gt; &gt; reward for those <br/>
&gt; &gt; folks who already signed up for Premium Membership.<br/>
&gt; &gt; They are really <br/>
&gt; &gt; paying for Ad-free message boards and <br/>
&gt; &gt; No banner ads on AtlasQuest hosted clues. When I<br/>
&gt; &gt; plant a Premium <br/>
&gt; &gt; Member only box, it is a sort of "thank you" to<br/>
&gt; &gt; those folks. I could <br/>
&gt; &gt; have just made it a Postal Letterbox and mailed it<br/>
&gt; &gt; around to <br/>
&gt; &gt; everybody...but that would have cost everybody a<br/>
&gt; &gt; couple of dollars <br/>
&gt; &gt; (in addition to what they already paid for premium<br/>
&gt; &gt; membership) and it <br/>
&gt; &gt; would have taken forever! This way I can plant a<br/>
&gt; &gt; variety of <br/>
&gt; &gt; Letterboxes in several different states for Premium<br/>
&gt; &gt; members to find <br/>
&gt; &gt; at their leisure. <br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; No biggie. I also welcome the different points of<br/>
&gt; &gt; view and the <br/>
&gt; &gt; discussion that has arisen from the Baaaa Humbug<br/>
&gt; &gt; Box. <br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; I hope that the premium members of AtlasQuest will<br/>
&gt; &gt; protect the <br/>
&gt; &gt; integrity of the clues and not be swayed by bribery<br/>
&gt; &gt; or blackmail :-)<br/>
&gt; &gt; into releasing them others. Please treat this box as<br/>
&gt; &gt; any other <br/>
&gt; &gt; mystery box. Be discreet!<br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>

<div>Well, I have to kind of agree with her on this one. She is putting such a huge amount of really talented work into this series that if it was me, I'd want to try and keep it as safe as possible. I don't think, and I know she doesn't either, that her series of boxes are any better than anyone else's in the boxing sense, you know, like they are all special and unique, and everyone puts something of him or her self into each one. She *is* spending a fair amount of money on them buying the craft supplies, but I know it's not the money part of it that she thinks about, or expects anyone else to think about. She is having such fun making up the stories (it's a mystery/treasure chest series) and such fun doing all the work. She would like to hope that by the method in which she is hiding and putting them on premium, that they will last a very long time and be available to other boxers for a long time. </div>
<div> </div>
<div>She has made almost all of her logbooks because she is just naturally a "craft person", you know, she really got into the whole book binding thing, and she has had some go missing. She doesn't mind that aspect of it, putting in the work and knowing they can go poof. She accepts that it's a chance you take. It's just that this whole big series she is doing is kind of special to her. </div>

 &gt;<br/>
 &gt;<br/>
 &gt; First, let me say I am a big fan of Amanda from Seattle.  I dig her<br/>
 &gt; clues very much.  I mean<br/>
 &gt; no disrespect to her in any way.<br/>
 &gt;<br/>
 &gt; That said...<br/>
 &gt;<br/>
 &gt; The whole "Atlas Quest - Premium Members Only" thing really rubbed me<br/>
 &gt; the wrong way.<br/>
 &gt; I don't have a specific set of reasons why.  It just seems contrary to<br/>
 &gt; my idea of<br/>
 &gt; letterboxing.  By this, I don't mean how Amanda wrote that posting, I<br/>
 &gt; mean the concept of<br/>
 &gt; "Premium Clues/Members Only" in general.<br/>
 &gt;<br/>
 &gt; How do you all feel about this?  I'm not looking to flame Amanda.  I'm<br/>
 &gt; just interested how<br/>
 &gt; and why others feel on this topic so I can get my head straight on it<br/>
 &gt; too.<br/>
 &gt;<br/>
 &gt; Is this the future of letterboxing?  Pay-to-play?  Will we eventually<br/>
 &gt; be registering our credit<br/>
 &gt; cards on sites with monthly fees like porn sites?  [So I hear.]<br/>
 &gt;<br/>
 &gt; I'm verklempt!  Discuss amongst yourselves...<br/>

time, energy and money went into creating that site (or any site of such <br/>
complexity for that matter), and why should they not have a way to <br/>
recoup some of that effort.  The site will never earn the money it needs <br/>
through the premium member program it has to recoup all of the costs, <br/>
but at least they can get some back, while offering a great resource for <br/>
everyone plus a little extra for others.  There are so many boxes out <br/>
there, I would not worry about the few "fee" boxes.  Find, plant, have <br/>
fun, and don't let politics get the better of you.<br/>

However, I sense your post questions whether a "trend" of $$$ for <br/>
boxes is a good thing.  But the AQ fee is optional and doesn't get <br/>
you much more than the free membership.  So there is no real <br/>
imbalance.  Free enterprise is a good thing.  But if LBNA pulls <br/>
a "bait and switch" (free now, pay later) I'll be the first with the <br/>
flame thrower.<br/>
<br/>
Folks will do what they can afford to do.  Would I pay for another <br/>
site membership?  Heck, no.  This one was out of curiosity. I still <br/>
have about 15,817 boxes on the LBNA list to find. (./.500 = 31.6 yrs)<br/>

<div>Hum.... I think I paid for a membership because I really like the atlasquest site and it was really helpful for me.  So I thought that the person who put all that time into it should get something for it.Maybe it's that shareware mentality.   I think I probably would pay for a gather because it looks like work and there are some fees involved.  I like that everyone brings food too.  I probably wouldn't buy t shirts or books or...um...crap.  Maybe ink or tupperware, hahaha, wouldn't that be funny, have a tupperware party at a gather.  Then the host could get free tupperware.  I don't think that deep in my heart I paid for a membership to get clues to boxes because I have enough trouble getting to boxes that are already there.  I think people can do anything that they want with their boxes because it's THEIR box, it's their...joy!  You could even suspend it over a pit of lava as long as you disclosed it.  Like I could put a box in my front yard and only give the clues out to people who had a W in their name.  It would be joy. </div>

ya know, the one that buys all the Ebay stuff, like the virgin Mary <br/>
grilled cheese sandwich and the cup that had the water that Elvis <br/>

carve the grilled cheese sandwich and the casino logo and they could <br/>
pay you to plant it. What a fun series that would be. LOL<br/>
<br/>
All kidding aside, I feel that, after paying it of course, $24 for <br/>
AQ was a little too much to charge for what you get for it. Not <br/>
looking at the ads, a special message board, and a handful <br/>
of "private" letterboxes, none even remotely near me at that, is'nt <br/>
worth $24 dollars. I shoulda' put that money in my gas tank and <br/>
drove out to some of the boxes I had free access to that are near <br/>
me. I won't pay it again, anywhere. <br/>
<br/>
I would pay a fee to attend gatherings, but only if it is per <br/>
family, not per person, and only if it was no more than $10.00. I <br/>
put $5.00 in the donation hat anyway. For more than that it is <br/>
unaffordable and unreasonable, at least to me. I would put in more <br/>
if there was a live band, guest speakers, activities ran by someone <br/>
that requires a fee, ect. <br/>

I have looked at the prices for a t-shirt on someones cafe press <br/>
site and will not pay $10.99 for a cheap t shirt or the $14.99 for a <br/>
less cheap t shirt and $5.00 shipping!. I would pay $2.50 shipping, <br/>
what it really costs to mail 1 t shirt in a bubble wrap envelope, (I <br/>
know because I Ebay alot) and up to $8.00 for a shirt. My opinion is <br/>
most everything off the web is overpriced when you look at shipping. <br/>
<br/>
I wish you the best of luck if you are interested in pursuing this. <br/>
To each his own and may you be successful if you try. Keep us <br/>
informed! I would love to have other patches and t shirts, but only <br/>
if the price is reasonable. I think a little advertising may be good <br/>
for letterboxing, but quality is always better than quantity. I <br/>
would certainly enjoy having a few more boxers out there, as long as <br/>
they are respectful to the hobby like most others I have met.<br/>
<br/>
But that's my 2 cent. Please don't take it personally. <br/>

                    <div id="ygrps-yiv-1939003401">One of the great things about letterboxing is that you don't have to <br/>
pay much to play. Gas money to and from the trailhead, a journal and a <br/>
stamp and you are good to go. <br/>
<br/>
All this extra stuff in letterboxing is not neccessary. You don't have <br/>
to participate in the talk lists, you don't have to plant boxes, you <br/>
don't have to go to gatherings. You don't even have to own a computer. <br/>
You can go to the library and get 1000's of clues for free online and <br/>
go hunt for them. Or you can go to a local EMS or other outdoor store <br/>
that provides clues to local boxes. You can organize your own "private <br/>
letterboxing cabal" among your local church youth group or scouting <br/>
organization. You don't have to rely on Atlas Quest or LBNA for your <br/>
clues. It just depends on what you want to do with the hobby. <br/>
<br/>
Do you like to play soccer? You can play soccer without paying for a <br/>
bunch of "commercialization". Just call up all your friends and go to <br/>
the park and play soccer. OR you can join a league (costs money) wear <br/>
a uniform (costs money and often advertises a local pizza place or <br/>
sporting goods store) and set a schedule, have playoffs and <br/>
tournaments with other teams. It depends on how you like to play <br/>
soccer. (How serious are you about your soccer??)<br/>
<br/>
I don't mind a little commercialization (well, I was the one who <br/>
started all this with my plug for premium member boxes!) I like <br/>
letterboxing T shirts and backpacks and patches and wristbands. I love <br/>
all the stuff that Silent Doug has for sale at Cafe Press! I wish I <br/>
could afford to buy a ton of it. I love finding letterboxes by great <br/>
carvers like Spring Chick and Art Trekker and She Who Plants and I do <br/>
pay a ton of money in traveling fees (airline fares and rental cars, <br/>
hotels and camping fees, fees to park the car and fees to enter <br/>
parks!) to find these letterboxes. And I have paid to find boxes that <br/>
weren't so fantastic, that I found were missing or damaged. In many <br/>
cases, where I had to pay a fee to enter a park...to find one <br/>
letterbox, I would add a box in the same park, just to make it "more <br/>
worthwhile" for the next letterboxer. Now there are two letterboxes in <br/>
that park. <br/>
<br/>
Sometimes I have bypassed a letterbox because there was a fee to enter <br/>
the park. (I'm on a budget!) <br/>
Again, it is all about what you want to do with the hobby. If you <br/>
don't want to spend a lot of money, you can do that and you can still <br/>
get some wonderful letterboxes by some wonderful letterboxers. The <br/>
amount of money you spend doesn't mean a thing. Some folks spend a <br/>
fortune on their letterboxes with expensive rubbermaid containers and <br/>
ink pads, art paper pads and special stamps professionally made! And <br/>
other folks carve an eraser and get their paper and containers from <br/>
the dollar store. Either way can yield a fantastic, artistic <br/>
letterbox. Again, it is how YOU want to play the game.<br/>

Tupperware!  Don't forget scrapbooking supplies!<br/>
<br/>
I know the effort that goes into gatherings so I would<br/>
support small fees for that, above the camp entry fee.<br/>
<br/>
It would only be a fair weather hobby, for most, if it<br/>
became that trendy (faddish).  Wouldn't want to deal<br/>
with those sticker bushes, snakes, skeeters, mud (on<br/>
the Tims), and poison ivy, humidity, heat, rain, etc.<br/>
<br/>
I'm fortunate to be in an area with lots of easy to<br/>
get to boxes which absolutely have my hooked on the<br/>
hobby.  I haven't tried any of the more challenging<br/>
ones and I am looking forward to placing my first<br/>
series.<br/>

<div>
<div>That's not what I got from the responses at all. </div>
<div> </div>
<div>You asked one question about one site having boxes available to premium members. You didn't ask us about the "general commercialization" of letterboxing. I responded to the question about atlasquest. I can't speak for anyone else's response. No, I would like the "general commercialization" of the hobby. No, I wouldn't like to see whole sites that are for members only. That's not what atlasquest is doing. </div>
<div> </div>
<div>And no, I wouldn't like to see gatherings for a fee, with all the things you mentioned. </div>
<div> </div>
<div>I think the way you worded the question is a little bit sarcastic and slanted, like you are saying that's what you think we feel, according to our responses, like you have already made up your mind about it. You seem like you have some pretty emotional feelings about the issue, which is understandable. I feel pretty strongly about some issues surrounding boxing also. </div>

to criticize AtlasQuest or Amanda for their efforts.  I'd like to apologize to Amanda and <br/>
Ryan, too if anything I wrote was perceived as a flame or an attack.  I wish you only the <br/>
best of luck with the site, and thank you for all your efforts. <br/>
<br/>
I want to just make a few observations and then I will go away and we can bury this nag.<br/>
<br/>
It seems to me, in this game without rules, that we operate more like a small village.  We <br/>
don't have laws, we have mores, customs and taboos.  We never say you can't do things.  <br/>
We discourage them as a group.  We discourage burying boxes.  We discourage placing <br/>
boxes in sensitive areas.  We encourage boxes for families and people with limited <br/>
physical abilities.  Letterboxing is what we say it is.<br/>
<br/>
Dartmoor letterboxing has survived for over 100 years because of the secrecy of the <br/>
participants and a limited area of practice.  For us, that ship has sailed.  In just 7 years we <br/>
have more than doubled the number of letterboxes and exported the game all over the <br/>
world.  <br/>
<br/>
Change is a slow, gradual process where you wake up one morning in your farmhouse to <br/>
find a McDonald's next door.  <br/>
<br/>
Not all change is bad.  Do you control it? Or does it control you?    Granted AtlasQuest is a <br/>
great site run by great people.  What about the next one?  <br/>
<br/>
I'm not advocating a revolt.  But perhaps I am just suggesting we occaisionally look a little <br/>
beyond immediate clue gratification.<br/>
<br/>
Good things need to be fiercely protected or they go away.  Don't believe me?  Pick up any <br/>
History book.<br/>
<br/>
Thank you for your tolerance and your kind attention.  I will go back to the woods now and <br/>
lurk.<br/>

&gt; <br/>
&gt; You asked one question about one site having boxes available to premium members. <br/>
You didn't ask us about the "general commercialization" of letterboxing. I responded to <br/>
the question about atlasquest. I can't speak for anyone else's response. No, I would like <br/>
the "general commercialization" of the hobby. No, I wouldn't like to see whole sites that <br/>
are for members only. That's not what atlasquest is doing. <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; And no, I wouldn't like to see gatherings for a fee, with all the things you mentioned. <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I think the way you worded the question is a little bit sarcastic and slanted, like you are <br/>
saying that's what you think we feel, according to our responses, like you have already <br/>
made up your mind about it. You seem like you have some pretty emotional feelings about <br/>
the issue, which is understandable. I feel pretty strongly about some issues surrounding <br/>
boxing also. <br/>

&gt; As I understand it from the general responses in this group - that most of you are okay <br/>
&gt; with the general commercialization of letterboxing.  <br/>
&gt; If, for example, a few sites opened up offering membership-only clues and books and <br/>
tee <br/>
&gt; shirts, bumperstickers etc., it would be a good thing for the game.  <br/>
&gt; Perhaps promoting regional gatherings for a small admission fee, too.... with a variety of <br/>
&gt; quality concessions, hiring guest speakers, organized activities.  Like a Woodstock for <br/>
&gt; Letterboxing.  Would that be good, too?<br/>
&gt; I mean it does seem that there is money to be made out there - particularly if the sites <br/>
&gt; were to try and broaden the appeal of the game by doing a little advertising and <br/>
&gt; promotion.  If there were more people doing it, there would be more and better boxes <br/>
for <br/>
&gt; everyone.<br/>

<div>Don't you dare go back to lurking!  ::::::::::pinch:::::::::::::::  I didn't interpret anything you said as a flame and I don't think anyone else did, so you shouldn't worry about that. I just felt like you had kind of already made up your mind about what we felt, and if you did, (and if I'm wrong I stand corrected, believe me)  it's just because it's something you seem to feel really strongly about. </div>
<div> </div>
<div>I think we should make "Letterboxing is what we say it is" as the motto of the LBMA board, even put it on the home page (Doug?) I think that's a very good way to put it and a good way to practice boxing.  And you're right about looking at history to prove that good things need to be protected. </div>
<div> </div>
<div>You brought up some very interesting points, and I think we were all able to discuss it like adults and not like a certain other list that shall remain nameless....I'll just point. </div>
<div> </div>
<div>So there. If you go back to lurking you'll just have to be killed, or at the very least seriously pinched. &lt;EG&gt; </div>

<font face="Arial,sans-serif"><font size="2">Nor do I.  As far as AQ
goes, to me it is just trying to make up SOME of the money spent to
create and maintain the site.  Web sites that require the space and
bandwidth that AQ does are very costly to run.  I don't see a day when
you will have to pay for an event.  Yes, you may have to pay for SOME
clues, but there are so many free clues out there, I don't think it is
a big deal, and it is a way to reward those that support the site.<br/>

BTW, I am not a premium member of AQ.<br/>
