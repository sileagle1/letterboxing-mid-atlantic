                    <div id="ygrps-yiv-922106382">We had one of those "corporate days of caring" yesterday where a <br/>
department will go out and halp out a non-profit organization of some <br/>
sort (schools, the Trexler preserve, Scout camps, etc.) and we did a <br/>
fair bit of landscaping (as the staff had been cut to 1 guy).  The <br/>
pony ride area was one of the areas weeded and cleaned up, along with <br/>
beds at the entrance and a butterfly garden area.  Got good and slimey <br/>
and still had some energy to hide a box in a cool container other than <br/>
Douggerware!<br/>
<br/>
I think that the ponies would have no problems with you, it's the <br/>
staff that may balk.  Most users are like 6 yrs old!  ;-)<br/>
