Here is a second post from the geocaching forum:<br/>
"Retired NPS ranger here with a word of advice. Contact the owner of <br/>
the letterbox and have him remove it pronto. He'd be liable for a <br/>
hefty fine if it was discovered, and it wouldn't take the Fed more <br/>
than five minutes to find out his real name, his great-grandmother's <br/>
address in 1916 and what he had for breakfast this morning."<br/>
<br/>
My sixth sense tells me that these guys really are going to call the <br/>
park and make trouble, just to prove that they are right. Another <br/>
possibility is that NPS personnel will discover these by reading the <br/>
geocaching.com forums themselves next week.<br/>
<br/>
I've dealt with Great Falls for orienteering, they'll be professional <br/>
about it, but they aren't going to ignore these letterboxes having <br/>
been thrown in their faces in the manner that "Difficult Run" has <br/>
done. The fact that the clues didn't list Great Falls may have given <br/>
them some cover to live and let live, or maybe they had completely <br/>
missed the boxes on their land, but that's blown now, or it will be <br/>
when the busybodies hit the phone.<br/>
<br/>
Unless the owners of the boxes in question have permission in writing <br/>
from the park itself (unfortunately I doubt that, based on the park), <br/>
they may want to grab the boxes, for no other reason than to preserve <br/>
the letterboxes from the muggles that are coming.<br/>
<br/>
If anyone else has one hidden on other NPS land in the Capitol Region <br/>
(or maybe NPS land overall), the same advice applies, based on the <br/>
fact that parks do talk to each other. We may even wind up in Morning <br/>
Report.<br/>
<br/>
Sorry to be contrarian here, but I see this deal hitting the fan.<br/>

<br/>
I saw the reference to the guy's email address being from <br/>
yahoo.co.uk. That's a free email service just like yahoo.com is. <br/>
Plenty of non-Americans use yahoo.com, so the fact that an American <br/>
did the reverse and used YahooUK isn't significant. Perhaps his <br/>
favored user name was only available on YahooUK, or maybe he thinks <br/>
there is some coolness factor in using a British email. Who knows? <br/>
Who cares?<br/>
<br/>
The rat fink has over 40 geocaches and 30 USGS benchmarks posted as <br/>
found since he joined there in Feburary (a noobie), all in northern <br/>
Virginia. He did log a USGS benchmark in the area of these <br/>
letterboxes a couple weeks ago. The IP address in the actual header <br/>
leads back to Verizon Internet Service in Reston VA. The fact that <br/>
some on the main list wrongly and irrelvantly brought up <br/>
the "British" connection is why I figured the flame war was out of <br/>
control over there (what a surprise!). The rat fink is <br/>
(unfortunately) a resident of our area and he wasn't kidding.<br/>
<br/>
Hopefully, his "victory" note will calm things down. Jem_Heist <br/>
removed her letterbox in question, and he has bragged about it in <br/>
both forums. Maybe he'll be satisfied with that and go away.<br/>
<br/>
One piece of good news is that I don't know of any non-Federal public <br/>
land managers in Virginia that aren't wide open to letterboxing, so <br/>
there are plenty of places to plant and replant.<br/>
