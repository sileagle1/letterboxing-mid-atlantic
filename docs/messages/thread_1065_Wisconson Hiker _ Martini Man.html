Maryann. Time to eat swap stories and exchange stamps. All to soon it <br/>
was time to leave. I met up again today at Tyler Park with our new <br/>
friends to do some BOB boxes while Marie stayed home. Got four boxes I <br/>
did not have and they were well on their way to getting all of the BOB <br/>
boxes when I departed.<br/>
Just about dark now so maybe they are at Issac Newtons for a little <br/>
well earned refreshment. With one more day before heading home again I <br/>
hope they enjoyed their trip and look forward to when we might meet <br/>
again.<br/>
