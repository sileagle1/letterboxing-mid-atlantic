off into the woods" (most of the time) to "holy &amp;$@#$, a bear is <br/>
after me".  A vast majority are of the first type.  Bear sees you, <br/>
bear bolts.<br/>
<br/>
Nonetheless, most PA State Parks and Gamelands north of Blue Mountain<br/>
(even NJ side of the Delaware Water Gap) have some bear and have <br/>
signs posted as to the fact that this is "Bear Country".  I agree <br/>
that you should post that you may run into a bear, or in this case a <br/>
coyote.<br/>

For a summary of what NOT TO DO with respect to bears:<br/>

We had hairy legged it in Hickory Run about 4 weeks after said bear <br/>
encounter by the nitwits.  We did not bring food with us on the <br/>
trails as a precaution.  Water was OK.<br/>

Yep, I think I'd mention it.  Better safe than sorry.<br/>
We just planted one in VA in a park that's known to harbor a fair number <br/>
of (endangered) Canebrake Rattlesnakes.  You bet I mentioned it in the <br/>
clue, if for  no other reason than to prevent someone from chickening <br/>
out when they see the warning sign.<br/>
I'm a little jealous, but glad I didn't find myself in that situation <br/>
unprepared!<br/>

</span></blockquote>Absolutely. A first-hand account carries a lot more weight than the <br/>
standard tag line. I mentioned snakes in one clue, because we almost <br/>
tripped over a sun-bathing copperhead in the park. Another time the <br/>
issue was simply mosquitoes.<br/>
And speaking of encroaching wildlife - last week my family and some <br/>
friends spotted a bear wandering the streets of North Haledon, and a <br/>
few years back we had one here in Dumont. No longer just a far <br/>
northwestern NJ issue.<br/>
