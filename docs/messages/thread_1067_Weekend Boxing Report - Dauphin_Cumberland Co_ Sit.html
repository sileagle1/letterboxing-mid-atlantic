Hershey Kiss.  It's still surrounded by Poison Ivy and it looks like more to come this <br/>
summer.<br/>
<br/>
If I read it right, the last remaining box of For The Children is so covered in vines and <br/>
thorns it is truly unreachable until winter - if then.<br/>
<br/>
Dauphin Co. has a new monster lurking in it's trails.  Watch for The Beast With Two Backs<br/>
Coming Soon.<br/>
<br/>
America's First Superhighway (East) is back in full force.  The Westbound box was <br/>
relocated recently due to PENNDOT resculpturing of the roadside.  The new clue is in place <br/>
as well.<br/>
<br/>
A few more hitchhikers have started out or moved on.  A cuckoo clue is set free.<br/>
<br/>
Have a peaceful Memorial Day Holiday<br/>
<br/>
Watch for coyotes<br/>
