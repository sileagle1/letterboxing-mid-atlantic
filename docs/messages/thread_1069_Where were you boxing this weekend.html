Found on Sat. 4 of the 5 "Equinunk Charge" boxes. Did not get Equinunk <br/>

just step over the fence and go under the bushes. Went on to <br/>
find "Irving Cliff", "Panther Swamp" and "Promised Land" all alive and <br/>
well. Again the rain came and we headed home. Sunday with Wisconson <br/>

grtting harder to find due to growth of underbrush.<br/>

<div>I spent a lovely morning getting "Erik's Box" and "Antique Carriage" 
letterbox at Red Rock Wilderness Overlook Park in Leesburg, Va. Both boxes alive

Lot's of Gardening - Cleaned up weeds in veggie garden, planed like <br/>
100 begonias and 36 portulacas and a bunch of lobelia and allysum.  <br/>
Found a spot to plant Dr. Evil when he comes home.  Watchin the kiddos <br/>
while Mrs. LB helps her folks out at their booth at Mayfair (the big <br/>
Allentown festival that I warned the Wisconsin Hiker and Martini Man <br/>
about).<br/>

Time to plant the hot peppers and 'maters!<br/>

Turtle  -- and it piqued my interest in the boxes there.  Then I<br/>
noticed the recent posts about Antique Carriage and worried that it<br/>
wasn't quite the two-fer (or in this case three-fer) that it could be.<br/>
 Glad to hear they're there.<br/>
<br/>
Took me quite a while to find Antique Carriage in the LBNA database --<br/>
it's one of a few listed as A Day in Leesburg.<br/>

Guess where I'll be next weekend?!?!<br/>

Fabulous, amazing, intriguing park. The guy who did the Mauch Chunk <br/>
gravity railroad way back when was doing the same here. They spent <br/>
only one summer on construction and the whole project mysteriously <br/>
died, with the railroad grades 2/3 completed. The whole place is now <br/>
overgrown, and some spots washed out, but there are tunnels, walls, <br/>
cuts and fills all over the mountain. One of those places <br/>
that "deserves" a box.<br/>
