<div>I just found out that another pne pf mine has gone missing............the Yo Taxi one I think I mentioned already and now the Little Apple In The Big Apple seems to be gone. That's my favorite location.  Crap on a cracker. I just replaced the Ode To Pie one, put a new logbook in the Lady Liberty one and now these two have gone into the letterbox black hole.  The Boxing Gods have left the building. lol </div>

<div>I have a replacement for Yo Taxi already and was going to place it today but wound up being up really late so am vegging out. I also have a companion for it done if I can find a place for it nearby. I'll check on the Little One and see if it is really gone, but it's easy to find, so it probably is. </div>
