                    <div id="ygrps-yiv-568609651">I adopted the rather large Clue series (25 boxes in all).<br/>
I am currently replacing missing boxes and relocating others to safer <br/>
locations and also having to change several directions due changes in <br/>
park topography.<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, I have relocated the Clue Solution to another park.  The <br/>
previous location was flooded out.  If you found the series but did not <br/>
find the final box, let me know and I will e-mail the directions and <br/>
location to you.<br/>

                    <div id="ygrps-yiv-900462389">Thanks Bob for taking on such a tremendous job.  Maybe we can revive <br/>
the Clue Gather after it is completed.  Like in Nov when Richmond <br/>
isn't sweltering and most of the Fall gathers have subsided.<br/>
