<div>I was just cruisin' the PLB list and saw a post from Jan asking people to skip sending her PBL's for now as she was admitted to a hospital in Philly via the ER. I have no idea how she got a computer. Anyway, this is one of ours so let's think good thoughts and if we get any more info keep each other informed. She just said it was an accident and did not know her recovery time. I emailed her asking for more info, which hospital, etc. Will let you know if I hear back. </div>

<div>Get well soon Jan!!</div>

chance she was going to be released today.<br/>
<br/>
She has also made a request for info on letterboxes that are drive-bys or level walking. <br/>
Hiking is out for a while and she doesn't want to go crazy without boxing. I know she would <br/>
welcome all well wishes for speedy recovery. She does have e-mail access even if she is not <br/>
released from the hospital today. <br/>
