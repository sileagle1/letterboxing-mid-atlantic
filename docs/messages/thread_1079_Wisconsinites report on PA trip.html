trip in southeastern Pennsylvania.  We want to send a big THANK YOU <br/>
to all the planters of boxes!  We enjoyed the wide variety of clues, <br/>
the creative stamps and the interesting parks we had a chance to <br/>
visit.  I planned to send individual messages with status updates to <br/>
the planters tonight, but with the LBNA site down I can't access <br/>
the "contact the placer" feature.  Hopefully I'll be able<br/>
to contact everyone over the weekend.<br/>
<br/>
Here are the boxes we were unable to find:<br/>
<br/>
* Mt. Minsi `98<br/>
* Indigo Turtle<br/>
* LOTR #4  Gollum (found lid of box)<br/>
* Great Blue Heron <br/>
* Catch the Wind (found indentation in ground under rock)<br/>
* Lock Ridge<br/>
* Fish in Outer Space #1<br/>
* Pinebrook Park<br/>
* Ghostly Gathering #1  Pirate<br/>
* Memory Cache (found box w/log, but no stamp in box)<br/>
<br/>
These represent only a small % of those we attempted.  We were very <br/>
happy to find so many other boxes and most were in good shape.  On <br/>
the few that needed maintenance, we dried out and/or replaced baggies <br/>
and logbooks when necessary.<br/>
<br/>
We didn't realize that PA would be almost jungle conditions! Lots <br/>
of heavy growth covering those common landmarks such as stumps, etc. <br/>
We encountered many brambly thorns, stinging nettles and poison ivy. <br/>
(Admittedly sometimes these weren't actually near the box, just<br/>
where we initially THOUGHT the box might be!) We have lots of <br/>
scratches and hopefully won't see any outbreak of rashes<br/>
<br/>
As a bonus of our trip, we got to meet several local boxers for joint <br/>
boxing excursions and/or for a tasty meal.  We really appreciated the <br/>
friendliness and hospitality of Lightin'Bug, Jan of Team Little<br/>
Dog (best wishes to her), Gerania93, Irene of Hikers &amp; Hounds, Miz <br/>
Scarlet, Teapot Marie and Eagle Bob.  <br/>
<br/>
Thanks also to those of you who emailed us restaurant tips.  If any <br/>
of you are in WI, please feel free to contact us for local info or to <br/>
get together for an exchange.  If by some remote possibility you will <br/>
be in our area on OCT 1, I'm planning a gathering for that day.<br/>
You can check www.hauntedharvest.homestead.com for more info.<br/>
<br/>
During our trip we did plant one box.  I'll post the clues on<br/>
this board since the site is currently down, then add them to LBNA <br/>
when it is back up.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks again!<br/>
