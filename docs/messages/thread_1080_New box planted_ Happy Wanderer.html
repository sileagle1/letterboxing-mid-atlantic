Location:  Get yourself to Ountmay Insimay (in the educated porcine <br/>
language) <br/>
Time:  2-3 hours  (~ 4 miles roundtrip with 1041 ft elevation <br/>
ascent/descent)<br/>
Terrain:  Rocky trail<br/>
<br/>
We've enjoyed traveling and hiking ever since we've been<br/>
married <br/>
(nearly 27 years!) and when we discovered letterboxing, we <br/>
enthusiastically incorporated that in our leisure pursuits.  To <br/>
celebrate this great combination of activities, we placed this box <br/>
while we were "wandering" in Pennsylvania.<br/>
<br/>
We were in search of another box when we ascended the AT to reach <br/>
this summit (marked by a sign on a tree, some stone steps and 4 <br/>
concrete pillars).  We enjoyed the hike, but were unsuccessful in our <br/>
hunt.  Hopefully you will have better luck!  As we left the summit to <br/>
retrace our steps descending the trail, we noticed a utility pole on <br/>
the right.  We noted the yellow sign with numbers on the pole:  <br/>
_________ - _________.  We'll reference the digits as ABCDE <br/>
FGHIJ.<br/>
<br/>
We then continued down and as we reached the "false summit"<br/>
there was <br/>
a decision point.  If you follow a bearing of BC+I degrees for a few <br/>
steps, you'll find yourself standing on a small circular AT<br/>
survey <br/>
marker.  From there, take a new bearing of HG degrees for A+B+C+J <br/>
steps, then E+F+J steps at a bearing of ABC  CAH degrees.  The <br/>
Wanderer is resting in a rocky spot beneath a coniferous tree.  <br/>
Please rehide him well so he is not found accidentally.  There should <br/>
be enough materials in the area to provide good cover.<br/>
<br/>
We hope you enjoyed this adventure in the DWG and since we don't<br/>
live <br/>
in the area we would really appreciate an update on the status of the <br/>
box if you find it.  We won't be able to check on it for quite a <br/>
while!</div>
