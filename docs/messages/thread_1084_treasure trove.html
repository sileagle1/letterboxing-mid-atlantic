disscussed some time in the past on the big list I think. <br/>
Yesterday on the today show I guy found one of the tokens in PA. <br/>
I went to a site that discusses the clues and it read alot like a <br/>
letterboxing  discussion. In one of the posts someone <br/>
suggested if you like solving clues you might try letterboxing or <br/>
geocaching.  I glanced at the book in a book store yesterday and <br/>
thought to my self  if you can find a Mapsurfer box then this <br/>
should be a piece of cake.</div>

looked at the book. You can bet that since that couple found the token <br/>
a lot more copies will be sold.<br/>
<br/>
When I first heard about it I thought that it sounded like fun, yes, <br/>
like a good letterbox type clue. Also thought that it would take <br/>
research time (OK) and the ability, time, money to travel. That's the <br/>
tough one. I can imagine telling my husband that I had to run out to <br/>
Missouri for a few days to check on a Treasure Trove clue. Ha! It still <br/>
would be fun to have a look and give it a try.<br/>
