day letterboxing!  <br/>
<br/>
First, we found "The Persistence of Winky" at the Philadelphia Art <br/>
Museum, we were glad to see that this box hung around for a few more <br/>
weeks!! <br/>
<br/>
Second, we went up to Manuyunk to find "Boards and Bridges", great <br/>
hike alond the canal, found the box- but the stamp (I type in horror) <br/>
was MISSING!! So I know this box was placed by Pico, but I seem to <br/>
recall that either Reindeers or Indigo Vulture was doing box <br/>
maintence on it, so a heads up the original stamp went missing- the <br/>
log book and tupperware container were still in place, I seem to <br/>
think the stamp may have wandered off with a previous finder.  Check <br/>
your bags.  Also, not to leave a box without a stamp, I carved a <br/>
really REALLY simple stamp, so beware it's crude, but at least there <br/>
is an image in the box if you attempt it.  <br/>
<br/>
Third, headed over to the Wizardland Box, great story, fun box.  But <br/>
there must be 80 gazillion trees with holes in the base!!! We <br/>
eventually found it! We also found the Global Traveller HH. <br/>
<br/>
Fourth, went to play with Dude the WonderDog!  I encourage everyone <br/>
to do these boxes.  The stamps are awesome, and the logbook is <br/>
probably the BEST I have ever seen.  It is really nice, my fondest <br/>
regards to Hikers and Hounds for their impeccable boxes!<br/>
<br/>
Fifth (it was a busy day, lol) we had an on trail exchange with Team <br/>
Kelly, nice family and cute baby.  They had kind words to say about <br/>
Irene!  They were out doing the Brave Little Catipillar Series.  <br/>
Since we had already found those boxes, we let The Gardener find <br/>
them!  They were all in great shape, although we didn't find Box #4, <br/>
so I don't know if it's missing or we just missed it.<br/>
<br/>
Sixth, headed back to Doylestown so that the The Gardener could find <br/>
the 4 Little Pigs box, it was in good shape, and we picked up the <br/>
Grin-N-Bear-It Hitch Hiker. <br/>
<br/>
Lastly we ended the night but doing some box maintance at our Happy <br/>
Happy Birthday Box and WoM Box.  Thank you to all that have found <br/>
these boxes!  <br/>
<br/>
Whew!  What am I doing tomorrow?<br/>

I finally found this reference.<br/>
I am supposed to be the babysitter for this one.<br/>
I plan to be in Manyunk tomorrow for the Arts Festival (one of my <br/>
girls actually has some school art on display there, somewhere.)<br/>
I will try to get to the box (family permitting) and either pull it <br/>
for repair or replace the stamp if I can carve one that quickly.<br/>
Check the list before attempting.<br/>
