<div>Out of over 2500 hundred people, there have to be *some* nice ones! LOL I remember when I first joined last June I think it was, maybe before that, there were something like 1600. I didn't unsubscribe, but I don't have the posts coming into a folder anymore. I'll look at it online once in a while and see who is flaming who, just to keep up. hah</div>

I have had my cheap ass Walmart stick over a year. I lean on it very, very heavily when I am huffin' and puffin' up a hill. Just ask anyone who has hiked with me! Ask Judy how I was today in Ridely Creek. Anyway, never had a problem. If you want to spend tons to have a stick with a lifetime guarantee, go for it. All I was saying was the for $14, if I get 6 months out of it (and I'm over a year now, got the original 2/04) I'm pleased. End of story. Now gotta go soak my a$$ in cold water!<br/><br/><b><i>gallant_rogue &lt;gallant_rogue@...&gt;</i></b> wrote:
