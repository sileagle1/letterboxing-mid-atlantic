I'm glad to hear this.  I had always planned to look for this box on
the way back from our next trip to Children's Hospital.  We were on our
way down Monday and the A/C went out about half way there.  Needless to
say, we were faced with a sweltering drive home.  We weren't in the
mood to look for it this trip.  Unless we make a special trip, it will
be 6 months before we go by that way again.<br/>

always in the car on letterboxing trips.<br/>
