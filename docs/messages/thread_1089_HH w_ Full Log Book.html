I found a hitch hiker in Florida, that started out Feb 2003 in Rhode<br/>
Island, and now, there are only two pages left in the logbook. I<br/>
emailed the placers twice over the past two weeks and asked if they<br/>
would like the stamp and book mailed to them, so they could see their<br/>
stamp's travels over the years. I haven't heard back yet, and was<br/>
wondering what you all thought I should do with the book and stamp. <br/>
If I were the placer, I'd really like to see my stamp and the book<br/>
after a couple years, perhaps make a new book, and set it out there again.<br/>
<br/>
I thought maybe I had the wrong email address but since I am going<br/>
through LBNA to send the emails, there is really no way to check. I'm<br/>
using the most recent box placed by the placers to send email, and<br/>
that was done in December 2004, so the address should be OK, don't you<br/>
think?<br/>
<br/>
The only other thing I can think of doing, is to add a new logbook to<br/>
the HH and set it out there. But now, if I do that, the HH needs more<br/>
space and won't be as easily placed.<br/>
Help!<br/>
Thanks</div>

The placer just today wrote to me. What a fine coincidence!<br/>
And they did want the book mailed to them to see it. I know I would <br/>
have felt the same way.<br/>
<br/>
This is such a great activity, and it is true, part of its beauty is <br/>
that it can be done however anyone wants to do it. <br/>
<br/>
Thank you for your help,<br/>
