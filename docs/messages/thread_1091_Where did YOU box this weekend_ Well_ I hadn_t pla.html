Until Thursday when Sowsewbizzy posted to the Red Hat list that she was coming to PA to box in Ridley Park. Anyone want to join her? Well, I certainly couldn't let my dear friend come to my state and box alone, what would this demur southern belle (gagging here) think of our yankee manners? Someone had to represent! So I stepped up to the plate and volunteered to meet her on Sunday. It's a dirty job, but someone had to do it.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Okay, totally committed to "Adult Day" on Saturday I got up at 8:00 and started reading the drama unfolding on the main list as I waited for my beloved family to wake up and do the chores with me that they needed me for. By noon Dude and I were howling mad that we blew off a perfectly good day to box to stay home and do chores when no one else in the house was up yet. When lo! and behold! my good buddy Lightnin' Bug calls and says "H&amp;H, am heading down the turnpike to a park not far from you to look for some boxes, would you and Dude care to join us?". So I looked at Dude, he sniffed at me and out the door we went. After all, when a good friend drives from two counties away, why you simply have to show up and support them in their boxing efforts, don't you? LB already gave you the Saturday report so here's what Sowbiz and I did Sunday:</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Our plan:</div>
<div>Meet at Ridley Creek State Park at 10:00 AM, grab several boxes, including Silent Dougs' then check out some other boxes in the area (Brandywine, etc.) hopefully net 6-8 boxes.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Our reality:</div>
<div>11:00 AM Irene arrives an hour late after deciding not to check directions to the park cause she's pretty sure she knows how to get there. Irene ends up buying Judy lunch for this one! (Judy was very gracious about it)</div>
<div>10:00 AM While waiting for Irene the Explorer, Judy the Trailblazer determines she has discovered a sure fire short cut to Silent Doug's box cutting an estimated 3-4 hike to perhaps an hour!</div>
<div>4PM - Irene and Judy leave the park with one box to their credit, Birdlady's AFI box, and a firm commitment to try again another time. We might even follow the clues next time!</div>
<div> </div>
<div>As usual, we were way too bawdy, laughed way too much and had too much fun. Oh, and we sweated. A lot. </div>
<div> </div>
<div>Next weekend I am staying home and doing chores....</div><p>
