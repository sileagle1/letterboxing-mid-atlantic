                    <div id="ygrps-yiv-1299170260"><div>Greetings to everyone.  Well now that the Circus is all packed up and sent off on its first road trip I am thinking about the rest of these stamps I have here.  They are a wonderful collection.  </div>
<div> </div>
<div>A couple of them are circus related and will end up with the Circus for a while.  At least one of them will join the original Clue game set.  What to do with the rest. </div>
<div> </div>
<div>I think they are all fine performances of their own and should be used. I think they should be planted, or released as hitchhikers, or even postal boxes.  </div>
<div> </div>
<div>What do y'all think, whose stamps they were?  I'll be happy to mail them back to you, hand them to you at the Fall Mystery Gather, or send them off as hitchhikers or PLBs on your behalf.  </div>
<div> </div>
<div>Please contact me off list with your thoughts.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Yours most truly,</div>
