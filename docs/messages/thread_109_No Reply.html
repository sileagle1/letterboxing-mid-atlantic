<br/>
I'll elaborate. I sent mail to the owner of the very first box that I <br/>
found.  OK, I was excited. I sent mail to the placer of the second <br/>
box that I found because there was a first finders 'prize'. OK, I was <br/>
still excited. I sent mail to the placer of an animal chewed box. I <br/>
didn't have much with me but I dried everything out as well as I <br/>
could and put the box back holes down so that it hopefully wouldn't <br/>
get wet again. Then, there was the missing box. The area wasn't far <br/>
from my home, so I went to look for it twice before reporting it <br/>
lost. No response from owner; nothing on the clue list. Next, a <br/>
swamped box. Soaked. I left the area and went to a store and bought a <br/>
small notebook to replace the wet one. The book was getting moldy so <br/>
I took it with me to dry it out. I contacted placer to ask if they <br/>
wanted me to double/triple bag it and put it back outside of the box, <br/>
mail it or just get rid of it because it was smeared and moldy. <br/>
Nothing.<br/>

Are people simply wary of unknown new letterboxers? I'm a 46 year old <br/>
NJ housewife but I suppose that I might seem like a threatening, <br/>
unknown entity in email. Have some of these people, perhaps, stopped <br/>
letterboxing and don't care any more? Do they have two or three email <br/>
addresses and don't often check the one that was given as a response <br/>
site on the clue list? or(D) all of the above. Kidding there. Any <br/>
thoughts on this matter would be appreciated.<br/>

months you are so buzzed by the excitement that you skip out of work <br/>
grinning like an idiot wondering if you can nab 5 boxes in 45 <br/>
minutes before the sun goes down.  It doesn't last though.<br/>
<br/>
You will hit a saturation point where you mellow on the hobby.  It <br/>
will be around the time that you have 60 or so boxes and you just <br/>
can't read another flame war or your head will explode.  <br/>
<br/>
I've hung around because some of the people are amazing and the <br/>
dream of a sublime box is still a draw. <br/>
<br/>
The point of this walk down memory lane is:<br/>
<br/>
1.  People don't check their e-mail daily.<br/>
2.  Some people have dropped out and when they go, it is with a <br/>
whimper and not a bang.  (although at least one person has been <br/>
kicked off of the Yahoo site)<br/>
3.  They don't care that the box is missing.  <br/>
4.  Maybe they are a little afraid of you. <br/>
5.  They're fat and lazy like me.  (see, it all comes full circle!)<br/>
<br/>
My advice is to shake it off and move on.  Find what you can, lament <br/>
about the rest, and don't take it too seriously or the fun suckers <br/>
will milk you dry.<br/>

<br/>
A couple of things might have happened, other than the placers just<br/>
not bothering to reply for every box.  Although that does happen!<br/>
<br/>
-The first is if you used the "contact the placer" function on the<br/>
clue page at letterboxing.org, and if the box owner replied to your<br/>
email without checking the return address....then letterbox.org got<br/>
your reply.  It took me a looong time to figure this out, in fact Wes<br/>
finally had to tell me (a big D'oh! here). :-)<br/>
<br/>
-Maybe they didn't recognise the email as being letterbox related.  My<br/>
email program filters out spam and sometimes "good" mail gets dumped<br/>
too.  I try to double check what isn't obviously spam but sometimes I<br/>
just don't have time, or forget.  For this reason I put "Letterboxing"<br/>
or something similar in the subject line when asking about a box.<br/>
<br/>
Hope this is helpful.<br/>
Cheers,<br/>

For me it's all about location, location, location. I am not an artist (or even an arteest!) if I didn't have my son to carve for me I would still letterbox and all my stamps would have to be store bought. While I thoroughly admire the incredible artwork I have seen, I am more awed or overwhelmed by the location, even with store bought stamps. I love the outdoors and what I love best about letterboxing is that it gets me to places I have never been before and/or never knew about. Like Patapsco State Park in MD or that place I am going to visit in NH next month but can't remember the name right now, Mount Monadock or something? Even when I don't find the box (which is OFTEN) I was just thrilled to be there. Okay, 'nuff from me now.<br/><br/><b><i>The Doubtful Guests &lt;thedoubtfulguests@...&gt;</i></b> wrote:

</span></blockquote>In addition to all the things I have learned in the de-cyphering of <br/>
clues, e.g. the definition of "sublime", I am intrigued by the pocket <br/>
parks in NoVA I never knew existed, and I do like the artwork I am <br/>
collecting (so prefer a carved stamp of any caliber), which one day <br/>
may be as valuable as the Tramp Art shown on Antiques Road Show (one <br/>
has to plan for retirement!).  So, in order of sublimity I would say <br/>
(1) cleaver clues that require internet research or tell me a story <br/>
with facts I didn't know, amusing is also a plus even before I leave <br/>
the house(office!) (2)at the 'site', clues which pick up on specifics <br/>
of the area beyond "double trunk tree" or make me use my compass (3)a <br/>
great piece of art that requires at least three colors to enhance (4) <br/>
having fantastic planters with which to gather--guess that one is <br/>
outside the box. <br/>

beautiful and new to me. I agree with what SewSow/Judy said, that I <br/>
do enjoy reading about the area I'm in so if history is provided, <br/>
that's a plus. I think some of the more fun boxes I've hunted were <br/>
creatively written, such as Pico's poem for "Boards and Bridges" or <br/>
the clues for "A Quaker Yarn" by Space Traveller.<br/>
