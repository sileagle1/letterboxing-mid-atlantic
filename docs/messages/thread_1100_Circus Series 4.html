&gt;Was that at the Circus Series 4 - box #1?  Gallant Rogue and I kept <br/>
&gt;circling around a similar one resting the the dappled sun.  Of course <br/>
&gt;we were in the wrong area, because the clues said 24paces and it was <br/>
&gt;really 60paces.  <br/>

</span></blockquote>60 paces!  No wonder we couldn't find this one.  This was the only one <br/>
we didn't find but I had the stamp image from the gathering.  We were <br/>
just hoping to find the one Lion HH that we were missing.<br/>
