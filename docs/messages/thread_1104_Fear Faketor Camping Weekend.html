<br/>
We (the family) went camping in Cordorus State Park in<br/>
PA this weekend. We were able to visit three of the<br/>
boxes and ended up with six stamps (including a HH<br/>
which will be planted here in Maryland). After two<br/>
very steamy hikes on Saturday, my hubby asked if I<br/>
wanted to finish the third box (Mary Ann Furnace)<br/>
Saturday evening - what a dumb question - of course!<br/>
(I think he's hooked).  We had a great time and what a<br/>
fabulous park for camping and only 90 minutes from<br/>
home! Happy boxing (and camping)!<br/>

hiking and boating in the spring, summer and fall, and ice skating in the <br/>
winter. The lake is manmade, and was created in the late 60s as a joint <br/>
project between the state and a local paper manufacturer (that now has <br/>

purposes).<br/>

When the water level is low, you can see the top of the church steeple that <br/>
once stood proudly in the village that was flooded to create the lake (or <br/>
so it is told).<br/>

Codorus State Park is in southern York county, my hometown area and a<br/>

it when you planted your Mason Dixon box.<br/>

the lake and gaze down into it's murky depths.  Only one teenager has ever taken that <br/>
dare.  <br/>
<br/>
Young Willy Baransky wanted to be liked by the in-crowd so much that he climbed into his <br/>
father's rowboat one October night and rowed out on Lake Codorus as the gang watched <br/>
from the shore.  <br/>
<br/>
He had heard all the stories.  Particularly the one about the brother and sister who were <br/>
playing hide and seek in the abandoned town on the morning they opened the floodgates.  <br/>
<br/>
Willy had heard that when the light of the full moon hits the surface of the lake you can <br/>
still see the little girl clinging to the top of the steeple waiting for a rescue that will never <br/>
come. <br/>
<br/>
But no one will ever know if Willy saw the ghost of the little girl in the moonlight.  He <br/>
disappeared that night - never to be seen again.  The next morning, his friends searched <br/>
the banks for some sign of what became of Willy.  They found his boat drifting on the lake.  <br/>
The oars were missing.  But caught in one of the oarlocks was....... a sharpened stainless <br/>
steel hook!<br/>
<br/>
That's how I heard it, anyway.<br/>
