                    <div id="ygrps-yiv-30051795">The Pine Barn Inn is a great place to stay! For about $70 (last year) <br/>
you get a nice air conditioned room with two double beds, one of which <br/>
is the quarter 'shaker' variety, color cable tv, and a lovely <br/>
restaurant that sometimes has live entertainment! <br/>
Plus there is a letterbox in the immediate vicinity, I am told.<br/>
And, they take AAA discounts there. I highly recommend it!<br/>
Enjoy!<br/>
