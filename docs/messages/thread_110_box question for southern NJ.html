                    <div id="ygrps-yiv-486435106">You probably figured this one out but I just checked the national <br/>
list and there's a box in, you guessed it, Bayville. If you'd like to <br/>
be away from the truck buddy picnic for awhile longer, there's one <br/>
south of there, 'Green Lily' in Tuckerton. Take route 9. I haven't <br/>
looked for either of those so I don't personally know if they're OK <br/>
or still there. There are 3 boxes on Long Beach Island. Route 9 again <br/>
but get off at Manahawkin and travel east over the bridge. I visited <br/>
those 3 boxes this Monday and they're all there/OK.<br/>
