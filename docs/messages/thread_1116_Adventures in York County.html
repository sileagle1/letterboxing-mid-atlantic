<font face="Arial,sans-serif"><font size="2">Hikers and Hounds,
including Dude the Wonder Dag, and I had a very successful adventure in
York county, PA yesterday, tracking down not less then 10 letterboxes. 
Impressive total for many, but particuarly considing who it was doing
the boxing ;-)<br/>
<br/>
We started the day with a warm-up Mapsurfer box, Witness: The Lost
Footage (<a class="ygrps-yiv-90845539moz-txt-link-freetext" href="http://www.mapsurfer.com/boxes/box63.html" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.mapsurfer.com/boxes/box63.html</a>), in an as yet to be
dissclosed location.<br/>
<br/>
Next on the table was FLY A KITE (<a class="ygrps-yiv-90845539moz-txt-link-freetext" href="http://tinyurl.com/e4rj4" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://tinyurl.com/e4rj4</a>) in a very
nice little state park.  We did not have a kite to fly, and had to meet
up with one who is RETIRED, but remains SewSoBusy.<br/>
<br/>
Our threesome then discovered Lost City (<a class="ygrps-yiv-90845539moz-txt-link-freetext" href="http://tinyurl.com/buuq3" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://tinyurl.com/buuq3</a>),
Four Two Two (<a class="ygrps-yiv-90845539moz-txt-link-freetext" href="http://tinyurl.com/dydct" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://tinyurl.com/dydct</a>), Mary Ann Furnace
(<a class="ygrps-yiv-90845539moz-txt-link-freetext" href="http://tinyurl.com/8296b" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://tinyurl.com/8296b</a>), and after a good lunch and some great cake,
Pigeon Hills (<a class="ygrps-yiv-90845539moz-txt-link-freetext" href="http://tinyurl.com/9dygt" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://tinyurl.com/9dygt</a>).  All were in excellent
condition.<br/>
<br/>
H&amp;H and I continued alone to find The First Conservationist
(<a class="ygrps-yiv-90845539moz-txt-link-freetext" href="http://tinyurl.com/djl69" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://tinyurl.com/djl69</a>).  These boxes were nice, and by a new boxer,
but they didn't bag the logs, so we added several bags to each to
secure them from the elements.  We also found "Hat Caper, TY" HH in the
second box, a Mapsurfer HH.<br/>
<br/>
Finally, for a nice nightcap, we discovered the eastbound box of
America's First Super Highway (<a class="ygrps-yiv-90845539moz-txt-link-freetext" href="http://tinyurl.com/8xfxd" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://tinyurl.com/8xfxd</a>), with the clue
reading assistance of Jan of Team Little Dog (I was going off of
memory, which is not typically too good)</font></font><font face="Arial,sans-serif"><font size="2">.<br/>
<br/>
Pretty accomplished day all around.  A Mapsurfer mystery box, along
with Natty's masterful creation, and cleaned out all of the boxes in
York county.  I guess i will have to start working on Bucks now :-O<br/>

                    <div id="ygrps-yiv-188484962"><div>Ok, now here's my version. I posted about never having heard of Codoras State Park and Cyulconinc posts back asking if I want to go there on Saturday with him. I discussed with Dude and he said yes, please let's do! (Cyclonic is one of his favorite trail buddies). Then Sowsewbizzy posts and asks to meet us there. So I thinking we're going to have a pleasant day boxing with dear friends. A nice stretch 'o the legs, a little sweat just to make me feel like I'm doing something healthy. So 6:00 AM Cyclonic shows up, Dude was actually ready on time for a change. We stumble into his car still half asleep and mumble "coffee, must have coffee". So we do the coffee and gas thing. The sun is out, the birds are sining, all's right with the world. Then suddenly, a cloud passes over the sun, Cyclonic turns to me to speak. The way his face is shaded it looks like two horns have grown out of his forehead and he says in a menacing voice "Just so you know, we are going after ALL the boxes in
 York County today! ALL I TELL YOU!! BWA-HA-HA-HA-HA!!!!" Or something like that! Poor Dude and I looked at each other in alarm! All the boxes, in one county, in a day?!?!?! Why, he's mad, MAD! We're thinking. But then he says it's only 9 or so, and with much whining on our part, he drags us all over York County, even makes us plant one while we're there, and delivers us, dazed and exhausted, back at our front door at 11:00 PM last night! Sowsewbizzy used some lame excuse about having to use her Joann's Fabrics 40% off gift certificate by midnight or it turns into a pumpkin and bailed after the Codoras boxes! </div>
<div> </div>
<div>But it was a great day with great people and Dude is at my elbow now whining to go somewhere again, he had so much fun. <br/><br/><b><i>Nathan Brown &lt;Cyclonic07@...&gt;</i></b> wrote:</div>
