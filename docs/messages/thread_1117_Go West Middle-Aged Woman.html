<div><font size="2">I will be heading to Colorado tomorrow morning and will be doing some planting and hopefully finding. I don't know our route yet. I have a long-time friend out there who I sent the lbna site to when I found it and she immediately became hooked also. We're going to plant her treasure hunt series and I am going to plant my Super Hero Series and my Retro Candy Series, for a total of 6 boxes. Amd maybe a couple more thrown in if I see some good locations. She will baby-sit them for me after I leave. </font></div>

<div>So this weekend has been spent running around doing pre-travel errands and making a sad attempt to leave a somewhat clean house for the pet sitter. I say somewhat.....visible dirt only will be cleaned up. There's housecleaning and then there's housecleaning. </div>

<br/>
I'm doing a little computing before we head out to do some more <br/>
boxing. We climbed a freaking mountain to plant one of my friend's <br/>
awesome boxes yesterday and I planted my super hero series. Mine <br/>
aren't quite so high. lol It was a great day. <br/>
<br/>
Airport security had no interest at all in my plastic containers with <br/>
the strange shapes inside. Don't you feel safer? HAH! <br/>
