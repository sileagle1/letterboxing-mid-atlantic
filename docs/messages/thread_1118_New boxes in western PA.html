The Aroostook Sleuth, Little Tag-a-long and Holster-roo traveled to <br/>
western PA last week and planted 6 boxes in the Childhood Adventure <br/>
Club series honoring the Sleuth's and Tag-a-long's childhood clubs <br/>
when growing up there.  The boxes are all planted in Westmoreland <br/>
county near Apollo.  If you are travelling to the area hope you will <br/>
check them out.  There are also at least three other boxes in the area <br/>
that we are aware of planted by another boxer.  All of these are <br/>
within in about 5 or 6 miles of each other.  If you find them, let us <br/>
know what you think.<br/>
Cheers,<br/>
The Aroostook Sleuth from Maine</div>
