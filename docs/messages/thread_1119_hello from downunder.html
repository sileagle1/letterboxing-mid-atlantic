Aus. I plan on making it 14. I left my sig stamp at my cousin's in LA. <br/>
While asking the bloke at the internet cafe next to our apt if we coulf <br/>
have a package mailed here we described what LBing was, he asked if we <br/>
would leave a box there. On another note had LB disaster in LA. I've <br/>
never had this happen, while reaching for the box perched on a ledge I <br/>
knocked the box off the ledge and it dropped into an unreachable spot. <br/>
I was warned about this in the clues and thought I was being careful. <br/>
Now I have to e-mail the placer and confess.</div>
