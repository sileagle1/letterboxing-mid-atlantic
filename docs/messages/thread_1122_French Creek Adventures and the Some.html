<br/>
Kirby Rider and I went to French Creek to do something mysterious and <br/>
plant 6 boxes from our Chinese Zodiac.  He had carved some of them and <br/>
is getting pretty proficient with the old speedball.  The region of <br/>
the Horse/Ox/Sheep does have some small wasps, so be careful.  We got <br/>
nailed, once each.<br/>
<br/>
Got some cool photos of some beaver stumps and some wood frogs (they <br/>
are camouflaged very well).<br/>
<br/>
Cruised to Cyclonics Letterboxing Special and left behind a running <br/>
hitchhiker with a newfound phage....<br/>
<br/>
The highlight of the day was when we got home and Sheba and the family <br/>
stopped by to do some exchanges.  She sat in the 'distinguished <br/>
letterboxer' chair.<br/>
