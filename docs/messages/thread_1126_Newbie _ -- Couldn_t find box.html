the wrong way.  (I did check the FAQ but didn't find the answer.)<br/>
<br/>
My 9yo son has recently, in his words, "become obsessed" with <br/>
letterboxing.  It looks like it will be a great way for us to pass a <br/>
summer vacation with some incidental learning thrown in for good <br/>
measure.<br/>
<br/>
My question relates to one of the boxes we looked for today, a NJ <br/>
mystery box (A Mooving Tale).  We figured out the clues and found the <br/>
site but were unable to find the box despite some time spent looking <br/>
for it.  How do we handle this?  I looked for a way to contact the <br/>
placers but couldn't find one.  Do people just give up and move to <br/>
the next one or ask for further clues from the placers?  At what <br/>
point is a box determined to be lost (I am assuming the determination <br/>
has to be made by a placer) and posted as such?<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for any insights.  I just wanted to know how to advise him <br/>
about this.<br/>

Don't be dicouraged. Look for other Letterboxes ... but in the mean <br/>
time... compare notes with other Letterboxers you will meet here... <br/>
( they are all nice people in Jersey) perhaps someone will email you <br/>
and give you some additional information that will help you find <br/>
that one.<br/>

<div>Well it is very interesting you mention H&amp;H, 'cause the first 6 - 9 months or so I thought all of the boxes I was hunting were MIA, LOL! They were almost always there, Dude and I had mis-read the clues, or impatiently applied the clues to the first V-shaped tree we came across. We're proud to say there is only one box that we have hunted multiple times that we still can't find and that's Mukluks Schofied Ford Covered Bridge. I've contacted her twice for some tips but no response. What Gallant Rogue said is true, don't get discouraged, keep on boxing. Maybe after a few months and a few more boxes under your belt you'll go back and find it in minutes, that's happend to us. Also, as you meet folks you can ask if they found it and perhaps they can point you in the right directions, I STILL have to do that, in fact Sheba is often on call as my tech-support staff when I am out boxing! This week Cyclonic and I had some help from Team Little Dog as we were trying to locate a box
 with no clues (he forgot to bring them). All she did was read the clues to us over the phone.</div>

<div>GR is right, there are GREAT people on this list, come to a gathering and meet them. There are two coming up, wait, 3 including NY. OR post to the list that you are looking for a trail buddy for a day and see if anybody is available. </div>

some of the PCLG boxes.  As they are no longer really active in the <br/>
boxing world, many of their boxes have gone missing and they may not <br/>
have gotten around to updating their site.  Many emi-retired boxers <br/>
don't bother with updating clues to reflect missingness.  There are <br/>
several in the Allentown, PA area that have been confirmed missing <br/>
several times by respected boxers, yet the clues do not relect that.  <br/>
Also, starting out with a mystery box is very ambitious and <br/>
admirable.  Good luck in your searches, perhaps hooking up with one <br/>
of us goofballs may be a good way to break into the hobby.  Irene's <br/>
boxes are cool.<br/>

perserverance (which tend to be in short supply at our house).<br/>
<br/>
We were very lucky on our first trip out -- we found 3 of 5 boxes and <br/>
two hitchhikers, so I think that set us up for disappointment.  As <br/>
for the mystery box, it was at a readily researchable location and <br/>
relatively close to our home.  And as AV said, the clues to the box <br/>
did seem so darn easy. (The boys did say they enjoyed visiting the <br/>
spot and learning more about that particular thing, so all was not <br/>
lost.) The vast majority we look at from time to time, shake our <br/>
heads in puzzlement and go back to more obvious ones.<br/>
<br/>
H&amp;H, when you see us, it will be me and 3 boys, including a toddler --<br/>
 the eldest is the obsessed one and the rest of us are along for the <br/>
ride tho' we are enjoying ourselves as well.<br/>
<br/>
We will try and make a gathering so we can meet some of you and learn <br/>
more about this fascinating hobby in person!  I think we are going to <br/>
pack a lunch and try Hartshorn Woods Park tomorrow (series placed by <br/>
Bookworm).  As I told DH, at least they have stopped bugging me about <br/>
their lack of pool in the backyard.<br/>

I'm hoping someone might know what it was?  Its a small US Flag and we found it in D.C. <br/>

<p>South of Constitution Avenue is the Constitution Gardens Park, which includes a small lake. Between 18th and 19th Streets, a footbridge leads to a small island with a memorial for the 56 signers of the Declaration of Independence. After perusing the signatures, head back up the steps to the bridge. Before crossing, you will see a line of trees heading off to your left between the memorial and a low stone wall. Walk along this line of trees until you reach the fifth tree. With your back to this tree, look due north and spot another tree on the far side of the stone wall. Walk directly toward this far tree, stopping at the wall. Directly in front of you, on the back side of the stone wall, the Independence Microbox is nestled in the grass.</p></font></td></tr></tr></tr></tr></tbody></table><br/></center></font></td></tr></tbody></table><br/><br/><b><i>Shelley Shearer &lt;justplaingeorge@...&gt;</i></b> wrote:</div>

Between the summer of 2004 and the first quarter 2005 (aprox) the <br/>
Mooving Tail box was moved due to construction in the area and the <br/>
site updated to indicate a couple more missing boxes.<br/>
<br/>
A box that they placed in southern NJ was still active/intact as of <br/>
last summer. I received the Charlie Brown HH in a PLB last year. <br/>
There was an email address in the log, the mail bounced.<br/>

someone might take up the slack, especially on the missing boxes.<br/>
<br/>
They chose some terrific locations to plant, Panic/Attack for <br/>

                    <div id="ygrps-yiv-1357068849">When I adopted the Martian Maggot boxes (I should have my head <br/>
examined) I followed the following procedure:<br/>
<br/>
1) Sent mail to her many times over months with no response. I <br/>
believe she moved to Canada in 2003.<br/>
<br/>
2) Contacted Choi with a list of boxes in NJ and PA, who contacted <br/>
her at another e-mail address he had for her.<br/>
<br/>
3) Recontacted Choi later to see if he had heard from her. He changed <br/>
her LBNA clues to have my name on them. In some ways this is <br/>
hijacking because we never got explicit permission. She just doesn't <br/>
care anymore. She never responded to any more of my inquiries as to <br/>
box locations, hints on exactly where they might be hidden so that <br/>
they could be maintained, or permission to access the clues on her <br/>
letterboxing website. So I am still in the process of searching for <br/>
the boxes and replacing/repairing them.<br/>
<br/>
4) I maintain the boxes staying true to her original intent. Because <br/>
Martian Maggot also designed a special web page for most of her <br/>
clues, I have kept the clue pointing to her site. Where the clues are <br/>
wrong or out of date, I add only enough information to the LBNA page <br/>
to correct the error but not change the original clue. <br/>
<br/>
Because PCLG boxes tend to be mystery boxes and the clues are on a <br/>
different web site, I recommend following the same procedure. I <br/>
believe if nobody from PCLG replies to John's emails and he feels you <br/>
are earnest and a good letterboxing citizen, he will assign the clue <br/>
over to you.<br/>
<br/>
I am going to check a PCLG box near me and perhaps do maintenance on <br/>
it. If it is a good location, I'll start the adoption process.<br/>
