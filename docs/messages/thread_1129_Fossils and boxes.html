<div>Hi y'all,</div>
<div>I remember someone in this group was looking to combine fossil hunting and letterboxing.  Well have I got something for you...</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Some of you who know me, know I carved 4 stamps of fossil shapes over a year ago.  These were to be placed in Swatara State Park, site of a public fossil pit.</div>
<div>Well, I went there finally, for father's day.  I could not find the fossil site.  I did manage to plant four boxes there however.  The clues are posted now.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>If anyone has exact directions on how to access this illusive fossil pit, please drop me a note offline.  Have fun.</div>
