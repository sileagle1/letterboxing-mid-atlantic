<div>As my company's training and development specialist I am partly responsble for keeping morale up. One of the things I do is look for wacky holidays to celebrate, such as Talk Like a Pirate Day - Sept. 19th Arrrr!!, Mad Hatters Day Oct. 16 (we all wear crazy hats). June we decided on Eat Your Vegetables Day, since we eat so much junk at work normally. While looking at July (I'm really liking Walk On Stilts Day but don't think I'll get it past the Safety Committee) I noticed Be Nice to New Jersey Week?! Why Jersey? Who came up with this holiday? Does that mean that from July 3 - 10 I can't make any cracks about Jersey Drivers, why PA charges Jersians (ites?) to cross our bridges and Jersey let's us in for free? Their funny accents in the northern end of the state, the Pineys, Jersey Devil, etc?  As a life long Pennsylvanian making fun of Joisey is part of our basic training. Of course it's all in good fun, and I image Jersey has a few things to say about PA, but
 I've never heard 'em! Anyway, to all my good buddies in the Garden State, the first week of July all your neighbors in the surrounding states are supposed to be nice to you and your kind. But July 11th, I'll be right back to ranting about those <a href="mailto:#@$%" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">#@$%</a> Joisey drivers! </div>

I will say one thing.  It does have a brand spankin' new letterbox in Lambertville.<br/>

Okay, one more good thing... Lambertville has more bars per person/sq. ft than anyone <br/>
