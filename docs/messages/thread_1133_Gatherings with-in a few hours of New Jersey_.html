I have been letterboxing for almost three years and have my fair share <br/>
of finds, and even a few placements, but my exchange and event stamp <br/>
counts (X3E0) are really quite sad for three years of letterboxing! So <br/>
I joined this group with the hopes of righting this wrong. I have never <br/>
been to any kind of letterboxing gathering, but it sounds like a lot of <br/>
fun. Is anyone planning any upcoming gathering in the New Jersey area <br/>
(I don't mind trveling a little)? If not would anyone be interested in <br/>
trying to put one together? I don't mind helping out, but I wouldn't <br/>
want to organize one by myself until I've been to a couple! Look <br/>
forward to hearing from you.<br/>

here, but I like to think we are good people.  Just watch out for the <br/>
old broad.<br/>
<br/>
There are a few different gathings coming up that you might be <br/>
interested in, that are not too too far away from you.<br/>
<br/>
The Fear Facktor gathering is coming up on July 30th.  All of the info <br/>
on that gathering is here:<br/>
