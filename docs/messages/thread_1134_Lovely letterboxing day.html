Hartshorne Park series in Atlantic Highlands, NJ.  It is a beautiful <br/>
state park and we were able to find 5 of the 6 stamps in the series <br/>
thanks to great clues by Bookworm (we were unable to locate Purple <br/>
Mountain Majesty although I am 99% sure we were in the right spot).  <br/>
My shoulders are going to feel it tomorrow, hauling around my 26 lb <br/>
toddler in that backpack for 2.5 miles, but the weather was beautiful <br/>
and it was extremely pleasant under all those shade trees.<br/>
