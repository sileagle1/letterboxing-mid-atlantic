<div> </div>
<div>I just found out that Hikers &amp; Hounds lost one of it's Colorado members, my brother Marty's dog, Chance. Chance was a 7 year old Australian Sheppard and the most phenominal animal I have ever known. When my mom passed in February Marty and </div>
<div>Chance came east for 6 weeks to help us deal with her personal effects. During that time Marty and Chance were members of Hikers &amp; Hounds. They helped us plant the Greatful Dead series in DE, and went on the ill-fated trip to Tyler Park to hunt Muk-Luk's boxes (we never even came close!). I chose the name Hikers &amp; Hounds because everyone in my family has animals and I thought it was easy enough to include whomever wanted to go on trail that day. All of our dogs have the own personal stamps ( a pawprint with thier first initial in it). Chance shared my sister's dog's stamp, Cody. My brother liked letterboxing so much (he is a surveyor by trade and has LOT'S of opportunity to plant) I sent him home to CO with 4 boxes. I don't know if he ever got around to it or not, I'll have to ask him sometime.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Marty gave Chance a nice big soup bone he got from the local restaurant. Chance developed an intestinal blockage and never recovered. Please don't give your dogs anything but dog food, and never rawhide. I lost a dog to a perforated stomach years ago caused by sharp rawhide edges. </div>
<div> </div>
<div>Anyway, it might seem stupid to post like this but we are just heartbroken. When we feel better we are going to carve and plant a memorial box in his honor in one of the many parks we visited while he was here. </div>
<div> </div>
<div>Animals enrich our lives in so many ways. It's just hard knowing the you will almost always out live them. Give your furry buddy a big hug and kiss tonight. Dude the Wonder Dog will get lots of extra attention from me this weekend. He's just think it's cause he's so great...and he is.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Have a great weekend guys.</div><p>
