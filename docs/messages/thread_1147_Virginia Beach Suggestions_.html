                    <div id="ygrps-yiv-719578289">We were there just a few weeks ago. The boxes we found were all very <br/>
quick. See below for a list:<br/>
<br/>
Golden's Brainteaser #1 - Box in ok condition, could use a little <br/>
repair work but still there. Emailed owner, but got no response. Took <br/>
us about 15 minutes to find.<br/>
<br/>
Golden's Brainteaser #2 - Box was missing. Trail was in bad shape, <br/>
muddy, trail signs missing. Try at own risk.<br/>
<br/>
Wild Indoors - Box in excellent condition. Indoor location and hand-<br/>
carved stamp. Great shop to visit. Very fun, quick find!<br/>
<br/>
Mr. Moody Goes to City View Park - Great quick 2 box series. Boxes in <br/>
great shape, large enogh to leave a HH behind in (which we did). <br/>
Stamps are very nice! Beware of thorns and brambles at Happy Guy!!!<br/>
<br/>
High Roller - Box in good shape. Great park! Short 5 minute walk to <br/>
box from car! Kids will love to roll down Mt. Trashmore!<br/>
<br/>
EEK's Bunny Box - Box in ok shape, logbook full, great hand-carved <br/>
stamp. Took less than 20 minutes to find and return to car. Contacted <br/>
the placer (ChilePepper) about maintainance, and they said they would <br/>
get out to it as soon as they could. Pretty quick find. A little muddy <br/>
if rain has been through recently. Be careful of snakes. We spotted <br/>
two on the trail!<br/>
<br/>
Good luck at your tournament! Happy boxing!<br/>

We live in this area, so we could adopt Golden's boxes if necessary.  <br/>
How long has it been since you wrote them?<br/>

Since the clues were easy, I'm guessing it's been muggled or crittered.<br/>

&gt; &gt; &gt; box from car! Kids will love to roll down Mt. Trashmore!<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; (We thought it a bit tricky to find, and the stamp is somewhat<br/>
&gt; tricky as<br/>
&gt; &gt; well.  I agree with the fun at Mount Trashmore!)<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; EEK's Bunny Box - Box in ok shape, logbook full, great hand-<br/>
&gt; carved<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; stamp. Took less than 20 minutes to find and return to car.<br/>
&gt; Contacted<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; the placer (ChilePepper) about maintainance, and they said they<br/>
&gt; would<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; get out to it as soon as they could. Pretty quick find. A little<br/>
&gt; muddy<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; if rain has been through recently. Be careful of snakes. We<br/>
&gt; spotted<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; two on the trail!<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; (I have replaced that log on EEK's behalf and we did some first<br/>
&gt; aid, so<br/>
&gt; &gt; it should be tip top now.  I understand there's also a geocache<br/>
&gt; &gt; somewhere nearby but don't know where.  Wish we could see snakes-<br/>
&gt; cool!)<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; Good luck at your tournament! Happy boxing!<br/>
