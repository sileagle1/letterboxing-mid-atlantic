<div><font size="2">Hey there!</font></div>

<div><font size="2">I'm back home from Colorado and there are 125 messages and I am too lazy to catch up. Hope everyone is well and boxing away! </font></div>

<div><font size="2">Found a note that my newish and replaced Lady Liberty is gone. Seems Verizon got around to servicing the phone booth. It's been there since last winter. So that's the first time it's been serviced since then? lol </font></div>

<div><font size="2">I planted 6 boxes, 3 in the Super Hero Series and 3 in the Retro Candy Series. Found quite a few, some in Utah. That was an experience to remember. Boxing out there is totally different than here.....wide open spaces, mountains, desert, HEAT and great boxes in the middle of freakin' nowhere!! And I mean NOWHERE. Very beautiful and awesome places. Snow in the mountains of Colorado one day and unbelievable heat in Utah the next. I took a few pictures and will put them on my website soon. </font></div>
