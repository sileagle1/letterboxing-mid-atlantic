This letterbox is named after my cat. <br/>
<br/>
NOTE: There is a firearms range in the park.  If it is in use, you <br/>
may want to skip this box until a later date.<br/>
<br/>
DIRECTIONS: From Interstate 287 get off at Route 23 heading south. <br/>
Just before the second light turn right and keep bearing right onto <br/>
West Parkway.  Park is on right.<br/>
<br/>
Can be done on the way to or after MOUNTAINSIDE Letterbox.<br/>
<br/>
Start at Walter Hanzl's rock.  Start walking at 270 degrees.  You'll <br/>
come to an unblazed trail.  Shortly up trail on left is tree with a <br/>
sign saying Parkland, and all the stuff you shouldn't do on <br/>
parkland.  From that tree go 18 paces at 30 degrees.  Behind tree, in <br/>
pile of rocks is what you seek.  <br/>
<br/>
Please hide box completely hidden from view where you found it after <br/>
stamping in.</div>
