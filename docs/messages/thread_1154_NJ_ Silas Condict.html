This letterbox was once the Mystery Letterbox SHENANIGANS.  I thought <br/>
it had never been found and I decided to make it a regular <br/>
letterbox.  A geochacher did stumble across it, so it had been found. <br/>
<br/>
NOTE: This is a very busy park.  Please be discreet. <br/>
<br/>
There are no blazed trails in this park.  Just go to the highest <br/>
point in the park at 1012 elevation.  There is a rock mound there.  <br/>
There is a railroad tie step there.  Start at the railroad tie step.  <br/>
Go 5 paces at 250 degrees to a flat rock.  From rock go 13 paces at <br/>
10 degrees to a small split tree.  From small tree go 21 paces at 350 <br/>
degrees.  Behind large rock, underneath pile of rocks is what you <br/>
seek.<br/>
<br/>
Please hide box completely hidden from view where you found it after <br/>
stamping in.</div>
