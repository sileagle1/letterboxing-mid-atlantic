I am a super mean mom who didn't allow a DVD player to be installed <br/>
in our van (looking out the window was good enough for me), so we <br/>
listen to books on tape while we travel from box to box.  And <br/>
wouldn't you know that we are listening to "Charlie and the Chocolate <br/>
Factory" right now?  So finding an actual golden ticket did get their <br/>
hopes up just a little bit!<br/>
<br/>
Unless I hear to the contrary from someone on the list, we are just <br/>
going to quietly put it back where we find it, but they are going to <br/>
be a touch disappointed.<br/>

ps  These kids are so into letterboxing that they worked nonstop <br/>
today helping us tear out our old kitchen floor on the promise that <br/>
we would go letterboxing on Monday if it was done by then.  This <br/>
hobby is GREAT!!!  And yes, I will freely admit that I am the meanest <br/>
mom ever, so no flaming please.<br/>

bit was their favorite.  But as a testament to the lure of <br/>
letterboxing, they kept going when we got to the tedious "use a heat <br/>
gun to scrape up the glue and then sweep up all the junk" part.  Then <br/>
again, that could be partially explained by the fact that it was <br/>
called a heat "gun."<br/>

</span></blockquote>Congratulations! Now the bad news - that box is gone. BUT the site is <br/>
still worth a visit, since the mystery object in question is really <br/>
something to see. If you've completed your homework, you've probably <br/>
learned that the action recommended in the first sentence of the clue <br/>
has been completed. We found the box during said action, when there <br/>
was nothing to see, kept up with news online, and then dragged the <br/>
kids out when we knew it was finished. By then the box had gone <br/>
missing.<br/>

to finding them in particular. But as you said, the site is such a <br/>
cool one that we will probably stop by anyway and check it out.  <br/>
Especially after all that work figuring out the clues!<br/>

&gt; I completely agree -- and it is a shame, because the clues are so <br/>
&gt; creative and well done and the stamps are fantastic.  And the <br/>
places <br/>
&gt; they chose are great, as they are usually ones that you wouldn't <br/>
&gt; necessarily know about, so you get to learn a little in the <br/>
process.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I just have to brag that we figured out the "Say What?" mystery <br/>
last <br/>
&gt; night. My DS actually cracked the code, as it had completely <br/>
stumped <br/>
&gt; me, and then we spent two hours on it... DH (who unfortunately has <br/>
&gt; not caught the bug yet and is resisting mightily) was rolling his <br/>
&gt; eyes as we were dancing the victory dance upon getting it done.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Is there any better feeling that getting those mysteries figured <br/>
out <br/>
&gt; (besides actually finding the box)?<br/>
