NOTE: Please be aware of the following if you decide to search for <br/>
this letterbox: <br/>
<br/>
Since the box was placed a 9/11 Memorial has been set up. Please be <br/>
respectful of those who are are at the Memorial. <br/>
<br/>
If the area is crowded, which it normally is, please just skip the <br/>
box and go back at a later time or date. <br/>
<br/>
A new log book has been added. The old one is there with many <br/>
messages in regards to 9/11. Please leave the old notebook so other's <br/>
can read it. <br/>
<br/>
There is bushwacking involved. Be prepared for off trail hiking. <br/>
<br/>
Clues: Easy <br/>
Terrain: One Long Up Hill Climb <br/>
Time: Less then 1 hour <br/>
<br/>
Traveling NORTH on 287, take Exit 43 for Intervale Road (Mountain <br/>
Lakes). At the end of the ramp turn LEFT and cross over I-287 to the <br/>
traffic light. Turn RIGHT at the light onto Fanny Road. Proceed <br/>
straight to the second stop sign. Turn RIGHT onto West Main Street. <br/>
Bear LEFT at the "Y" onto Powerville Road. Continue until the first <br/>
road on the left, McCaffrey Lane. Turn LEFT. A sign for Tourne Park <br/>
marks the entrance. <br/>
<br/>
Early Dutch settlers named this land "Torren", which means tower. <br/>
<br/>
The highlight of a trip to Tourne Park continues to be the view from <br/>
the top. <br/>
<br/>
The Tourne is the only remaining undeveloped fragment of the Great <br/>
Boonton Tract, purchased by David Ogden, Colonial Attorney-General of <br/>
New Jersey in 1759. McCaffrey Lane, which serves as the main entrance <br/>
to the park, was created in 1767 by Samuel Ogden to haul iron ore <br/>
from Hibernia's mines to his iron works in Old Boonton. Within this <br/>
historic region, the Continental Army manufactured cannon balls for <br/>
use during the American Revolution. <br/>
<br/>
Please be discreet, as this is a heavily traveled area. <br/>
<br/>
Start at the baseball field parking lot. Look for signs directing you <br/>
to the scenic overlook. Take and stay on trail to the top. There are <br/>
several viewing areas at the top of The Tourne. There is a 9/11 <br/>
Memorial. Please be respectful. From the bench there head straight <br/>
down the hill at 90 degrees. You will see a boulder on your right. <br/>
Continue downhill a few more steps. You will come to a group of <br/>
fallen trees.  The big one that has fallen with the stump on the left <br/>
is the tree to search. Look within the stump, there is the item you <br/>
seek. You may want to use a stick, just in case. <br/>
