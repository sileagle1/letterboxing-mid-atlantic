<br/>
Your journey starts at the place where this fire tower and 988 trees<br/>
were destroyed by the F-105 Thunderchief (the first jet designed to<br/>
release nuclear warheads at supersonic speeds).<br/>
<br/>
Park in the parking lot of this old fire tower. Take the trail at 240<br/>
degrees and walk up to where the fire tower used to be. You can still<br/>
see the concrete foundations. Stop and look west and look through the<br/>
trees, and you can see for miles of a clear day.<br/>
<br/>
Take the trail west and head down hill. This is a moderately steep<br/>
hill. You will come to a place where the path will divide. Stay on the<br/>
path at 300 degrees. At the second down log on the path look for the<br/>
pine tree at 75 degrees and behind this pine tree, at its base, you<br/>
will find what you came for. Thank you for stamping in. Please return<br/>
it to it's proper resting spot and please cover well. Thank you.<br/>
<br/>
Always proceed at your discretion. The owner of this letterbox assumes<br/>
no responsibility for your actions or any occurrence to you or your<br/>
company on this hunt. Please remember you are in a state forest.<br/>
Remember pack in pack out your trash and only you can prevent forest<br/>
fires. Treat this forest as if it were your home. Tread lightly.<br/>
<br/>
WAIVER OF RESPONSIBILITY AND DISCLAIMER<br/>
Letterboxing, like any outdoor sport, carries the risk of unforeseen<br/>
hazards. "Letterboxing North America" supports a policy of not<br/>
knowingly placing letterboxes in areas that will create undue risk to<br/>
the letterbox hunter. However, as conditions may vary, it is the<br/>
responsibility of the letterbox searcher to become thoroughly familiar<br/>
with the conditions in the area to be searched, to adequately prepare<br/>
for those conditions, and to conduct oneself safely and responsibly<br/>
with respect to those conditions and with respect to his or her<br/>
personal abilities and limitations. "Letterboxing North America" and<br/>
the individual letterbox sponsors assume no liability for events which<br/>
may occur related directly or indirectly to one's searching for a<br/>
letterbox.<br/>
<br/>
Do not let children hunt for letterboxes unsupervised.<br/>
