There are three things to keep in mind before setting out for this <br/>
letterbox. <br/>
Don't go looking after a heavy rain. <br/>
Don't go during ski season. <br/>
A disk golf course has been set up in the park.  You may need to <br/>
exercise some patience if disk golfers are around the CAMPGAW <br/>
letterbox.  <br/>

Find start of blue trail on right of road.  Take trail up hill.  Pass <br/>
red trail and then green trail.  Stay on blue trail.  At top blue and <br/>
red trails merge for approximately 10 yards.  When you come to the <br/>
tree indicating that the trail splits, two red blazes indicating a <br/>
red trail left turn &amp; one blue blaze indicating to go straight: <br/>
STOP.  From that tree go 20 paces at 280 degrees to a boulder, behind <br/>
boulder; under a rock is what you seek.           <br/>

Go back and pick up blue trail going the way you didn't come.  When <br/>
yellow trails merges with blue trail take the merged blue/yellow <br/>
trail.  At the top of the ski slope stop and enjoy the view. You'll <br/>
see a pole marking the end of the blue trail and indicating to take a <br/>
left for the yellow trail.  Take the yellow trail.  On the right of <br/>
the path a short ways down you'll see a tree with a sign on it that <br/>
says "End of Trail".  The sign has fallen down, it is near the <br/>
ground. If you start going down the red trail, you've gone too far. <br/>
From the tree with the sign go 12 paces at 15 degrees. At this point <br/>
you'll see a big log. A small log lies across the big log. Underneath <br/>
where the small log lies across the big log, underneath a rock, is <br/>
what you're searching for. <br/>
<br/>

<br/>
Go back and pick up yellow trail going the way you didn't come. When <br/>
you come to the red trail on the right side of the trail take it. <br/>
Continue following red trail.  When you come to the parking lot cross <br/>
it heading to the southeast corner. You'll see a sign that <br/>
says "Service road, do not enter". Southeast of that sign is a sewer. <br/>
Go to the sewer and take unblazed trail down towards lake. At lake <br/>
take a left and pick up orange trail around the lake. Orange trail <br/>
takes you back to your starting point.</div>
