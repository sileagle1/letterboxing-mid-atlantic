<div><font face="Arial" size="2">I went down to visit Dave in NJ this past weekend 
and we did a little 'boxing.</font></div>
<div><font face="Arial" size="2">Saturday was a bust - very frustrating. We searched 
for 3 boxes and didn't have much luck:</font></div>
<div><font face="Arial" size="2">Coward? LB - no stamp, but a very damp logbook - 
last visited July 14, 2003!</font></div>
<div><font face="Arial" size="2">Spy House LB  - archeology students digging in 
the yard, but no box found.</font></div>
<div><font face="Arial" size="2">Rose Hill Cemetery LB - found all the clue sites 
but no box.</font></div>
<div><font face="Arial" size="2">We were already depressed, so we went to visit 
David's old hometown.</font></div>
<div><font face="Arial" size="2"></font> </div>
<div><font face="Arial" size="2">Sunday, we had much better luck!</font></div>
<div><font face="Arial" size="2">Terra-Cotta Tangram LB - Success! and what fun! A 
great site and wonderful stamps.</font></div>
<div><font face="Arial" size="2">Oh, Be My Friend Mystery LB - another success and 
another great stamp.</font></div>
<div><font face="Arial" size="2">Pine Barrens Box Turtle Mystery LB - Ask a New 
Englander to find the mill site! Where there's running water... </font></div>
<div><font face="Arial" size="2">    We had a little problem with the 
compass reading, but found the box just fine - Thanks again for another great 
stamp.</font></div>
<div><font face="Arial" size="2">A much better day topped off by a dinner of German 
food - Excellent!</font></div>
<div><font face="Arial" size="2"></font> </div>
<div><font face="Arial" size="2">Monday found us in PA:</font></div>
<div><font face="Arial" size="2">Scudder Falls Bridge LB - Great directions and a 
cute little stamp.</font></div>
<div><font face="Arial" size="2">Battle of Trenton - 1776 LB - A nice little series 
and a great spot, wonderful hand-carved stamps. We'll be back to this spot for 
boxing I'm sure - didn't have time to gather more boxes before I had to make my 
train in Trenton.</font></div>
<div><font face="Arial" size="2">By the way, the Bowman Tower Park is closed on 
Mondays. Funny thing  is that the Washington Crossing Historical Park and 
Thompson-Neeley House was supposed to be closed Monday as well.</font></div>
<div><font face="Arial" size="2"></font> </div>
<div><font face="Arial" size="2">So, Thanks to everyone who placed these boxes and 
see you all next time.</font></div>
