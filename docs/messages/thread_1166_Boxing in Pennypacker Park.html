was too great to ignore, so we tackled 5 boxes in Pennypacker Park.  <br/>
Amazingly enough, and a first for us, we found all five that we were <br/>
looking for.  The locations were beautiful, the stamps were great and <br/>
we picked up a hitchhiker as well.  So a good day was had by all. <br/>

                    <div id="ygrps-yiv-1741039024">Thanks for the tip -- my DS just printed out the clues he could <br/>
readily find that related to PP Park as we were literally running out <br/>
the door.  We had about 4 hours to spare (we couldn't start until 2 <br/>
pm) so the number was perfect.  But we will have to plan a return <br/>
trip there, now that we have a map of the park in hand and we know <br/>
there are more to find!<br/>
