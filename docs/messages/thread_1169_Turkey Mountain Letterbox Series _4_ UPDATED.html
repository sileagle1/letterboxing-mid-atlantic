area from development, the Pyramid Mountain Natural Historic Area is <br/>

Pick up the yellow trail that begins across the street from the <br/>
Vistor's Center.  Pass the red trail on the right and then eventually <br/>
the blue trail intersection.  Later you'll pass the start of another <br/>
red trail of the left of the yellow trail.  Staying on the yellow <br/>
trail you'll eventually come to a man made bridge.  Up the brook on <br/>
the left are seasonal water falls you might want to check out before <br/>
continuing on the yellow trail.  You will then pass under the power <br/>
lines.  Eventually you'll come to a yellow blazed tree on the right <br/>
of the trail with a yellow diamond and the number 4 on the diamond.  <br/>
From that tree go 12 paces at 140 degrees to a rock.  Behind the rock <br/>
underneath another rock is what you seek.  <br/>

Continue following yellow trail, it does get a little tricky here, <br/>
pay close attention to the blazes.  At one point you'll have to go on <br/>
the road for a few feet and pick up yellow trail on the left of the <br/>
road again.  Eventually you'll pass the beginning of the green <br/>
trail.  Stay on yellow trail as you gradually ascend Turkey <br/>
mountain.  You'll pass thru an old rock wall.  Eventually you'll come <br/>
to another old rock wall. Take 5 paces on the left of the trail <br/>
before the rock wall.  There should be a small tree there.  To the <br/>
left of the small tree, under a rock, is what you seek.  <br/>

Pick up yellow trail going the way you didn't come.  Shortly you'll <br/>
come to the red trail.  Go left on the red trail.  Begin your decent <br/>
along red trail. Eventually you'll come to a rock that juts across <br/>
the trail on the right forming a perfect spot to sit and rest. There <br/>
is a very faded red blaze on the lower side of the rock. You'll have <br/>
to do a little bushwhacking from here. From that rock go 22 paces at <br/>
130 degrees to another rock. Then go 6 paces at 80 degrees. In a rock <br/>
crevice, behind a small rock is what you're searching for. <br/>

<br/>
Continue along red trail. At the bottom, take the merged red/green <br/>
trail on the right. Shortly the trail splits again, take right onto <br/>
the green trail going up the hill. Eventually you will come to ruins <br/>
on the right of the trail once you reach the top. Supposedly the <br/>
ruins were a summer place owned by an artist who worked for New <br/>
York's Museum of Natural History in the early part of the 1900s. The <br/>
owner abandoned the cottage when the power lines were built. Continue <br/>
along green trail. You will come to an overlook, which on a clear day <br/>
gives a view of the Manhattan skyline. On the overlook you will find <br/>
a small split tree with a blaze on the right split. From that tree <br/>
take 22 paces at 220 degrees to a small pine tree. From that tree go <br/>
3 paces at 260 degrees to a big rock. There is a small rock wedged in <br/>
a crevice behind the big rock. Behind that rock is what you're <br/>
searching for. This letterbox is dedicated to all those that were <br/>
lost on 09/11/01. Please take a moment when you find this box to <br/>
think of them. <br/>

<br/>
Continue following green trail. When trail splits take right fork <br/>
onto blue trail.  Blue trail will take you down the 100 steps back to <br/>
the parking lot.</div>
