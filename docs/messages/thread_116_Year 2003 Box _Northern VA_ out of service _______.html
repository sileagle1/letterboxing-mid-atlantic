<div></div>&gt;Date: Sat, 29 May 2004 04:06:25 -0000 
<div></div>&gt; 
<div></div>&gt;I'm sure I'm not the first boxer this has happened to, but I've 
<div></div>&gt;certainly never heard of it.  Feel free to beat me up (virtually) if I 
<div></div>&gt;did the wrong thing, but I couldn't think of any other solution. 
<div></div>&gt; 
<div></div>&gt;I rode my bike home from work today, and feeling insufferably healthy 
<div></div>&gt;and adventurous, decided to stop off to look for the two boxes in 
<div></div>&gt;Lacey Woods Park.  I looked for the Year 2003 box first.  As I rode 
<div></div>&gt;up, I noticed a pickup truck parked at the picnic pavilion with one or 
<div></div>&gt;two people around, but thought nothing of it.  I found the box exactly 
<div></div>&gt;where it was supposed to be.  It was in pretty good shape - a bit 
<div></div>&gt;waterlogged, but the book itself was dry.  I was the first boxer there 
<div></div>&gt;this spring.  I carried the box down near the road (and away from 
<div></div>&gt;mosquitoes - and it's only May!) to stamp in.  When I was finished, I 
<div></div>&gt;took the box back up the path, only to notice that three more vehicles 
<div></div>&gt;were now at the picnic area, and a host of people in gray uniforms 
<div></div>&gt;were gathered around.  Sure enough, I now saw that all the cars said 
<div></div>&gt;"Park Ranger" on the side.  The site of the box is in full view of the 
<div></div>&gt;picnic pavilion, and several of the dozen or so rangers were watching 
<div></div>&gt;me suspiciously.  (As a former prosecutor, I can tell you that law 
<div></div>&gt;enforcement officers tend to look askance at lone men in parks, for 
<div></div>&gt;more reasons than just the obvious one.) 
<div></div>&gt; 
<div></div>&gt;Rather than replace the box while they were watching me, I tucked it 
<div></div>&gt;under my arm, got on my bike and rode through the picnic area to see 
<div></div>&gt;what was up.  Charcoal grills were lit, hotdogs were cooking . . . 
<div></div>&gt;Unbelievable.  The rangers were having a picnic!!!  They were 
<div></div>&gt;obviously planning on being there for the long haul.  And they were 
<div></div>&gt;watching me. 
<div></div>&gt; 
<div></div>&gt;There was no way I could replant the box without the rangers seeing 
<div></div>&gt;me.  And I wasn't about to ask permission because, at best, I foresaw 
<div></div>&gt;a long, long discussion with lots of skeptical stares ("so you hide 
<div></div>&gt;this thing in the woods, and other people come looking for it, and . . 
<div></div>&gt;.").  It's possible that I could have persuaded them.  It's also 
<div></div>&gt;possible that the box would have been confiscated. 
<div></div>&gt; 
<div></div>&gt;So . . . I tucked the box in my bag and took it home with me. 
<div></div>&gt; 
<div></div>&gt;Sorry if I did the wrong thing, but I couldn't think of anything else. 
<div></div>&gt;  At least this way I can dry it out and replace the bags.  I`ll 
<div></div>&gt;replant it when I ride by next week, probably on Tuesday.  Apologies 
<div></div>&gt;to Schizokeet (the planter) and anyone else who might have been 
<div></div>&gt;planning to search this weekend.
