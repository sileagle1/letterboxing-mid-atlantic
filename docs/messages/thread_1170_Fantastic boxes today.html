                    <div id="ygrps-yiv-1038163758">We did the Terra Cotta Tangram.  GREAT series.  What a cool place, in <br/>
a creepy sort of way, and fun to learn about the Blue Comet on our <br/>
way down there.  We didn't think to take a tangram along to help us <br/>
out, so we had to backtrack a little, but it was really neat.  The <br/>
last box was pretty wet inside (maybe that rain last Friday?), <br/>
although luckily no damage to the log book.  We dried it out as best <br/>
we could and put the whole thing into a ziploc to be on the safe side.<br/>
<br/>
Weird -- there was a HUGE cloud of moths around that site.  I think <br/>
they were gypsy moths as all the trees were denuded.  They were <br/>
flying in our hair, running into our faces, you name it.  I have <br/>
never seen so many at one time.  Truly an infestation.<br/>
<br/>
We also did the "Oh Be My Friend" mystery box -- a lovely spot.  We <br/>
saw an enormous Northern Pine Snake (on the state threatened list) <br/>
near the bridge, easily 3-4 feet in length.<br/>
<br/>
So a great day, even if it was on the warm side.  Boys are with my <br/>
parents for the rest of the week, so I get to take a little break <br/>
from letterboxing while they whip their grandparents into taking them <br/>
out.  We have managed to find over 30 boxes in the 5 weeks we have <br/>
been doing this.  Have to confess that I will miss it just a little <br/>
while they are gone.... ;o)<br/>

before and had a whole year of letterboxing before I got back there. <br/>
The Blue Comet story is quite intresting as well.<br/>
<br/>
Oh, Be My Friend; I love Letterboxingbee's boxes! I have gone out to <br/>
find all of her NJ boxes. Very nice locations.<br/>
<br/>
Funny, I've been boxing in Southern NJ for over a year and have not <br/>
seen a snake yet; go figure. I have, however, had many a close <br/>
encounter with ticks.<br/>

</span></blockquote>South Jersey does have ticks.  We decided to rename Belleplain State <br/>
Forest to Belleplain State Tick Farm after our recent failed attempt <br/>
to find the Belleplain box.  Never saw so many ticks on four people <br/>
before!  SpringChick responded that she had another recent report of <br/>
the box being missing, but it's still posted as an active box.  Don't <br/>
go!!  Nice place to visit during winter though.  And South Jersey <br/>
beaches are the best.</div>
