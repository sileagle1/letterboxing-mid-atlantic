<br/>
Glad to hear things are going well.  That was a short stint in MA. <br/>
Maybe you can come the same week as the gathering I am hosting up at <br/>
Knoebels, Sept 24.  I just got done scouting out the area and will have <br/>
a very nice driving series to hunt, not to mention a bunch of other <br/>
boxes are lurking around up in that area thanks to Riendear and True Indigo.<br/>
