Papa Woodwose here of Crownsville MD. We haven't posted in awhile <br/>
but I try to read a bit. <br/>
Family got out and boxed this last weekend at Calvert Cliffs in MD. <br/>
Excellent location for a box. Really the best sort of boxing. Great <br/>
Trails, wild-life (Beaver, Herons, Squirrels(The placer as well!), <br/>
Fish, crabs, and More!), Million year old shark teeth and shells, <br/>
and swimming. We had been meaning to hunt this box with a trip to <br/>
the Cliffs for over a year. The box was there and the stamp was <br/>
useable, but the contents were rather wet. Ziploc sandwich boxes <br/>
just don't hold up. They will photo degrade over time a temp <br/>
extremes. We dried out the journal abit, were able to stamp in, <br/>
carried replacement bags so double up everything. We usually carry <br/>
an extra box and/or ductape with us for just such a repair but not <br/>
this time. The next hunter, for we do certainly recommend this trip, <br/>
take time to learn and research the cliffs some before you go so you <br/>
will know how to find the shark teeth, should carry a replacement <br/>
box if the placer has not visited yet. Good, thick plastic boxes can <br/>
usually be found at dollar stores. I just want to restate that the <br/>
Ziploc brand boxes should really not be used. <br/>
Hope ya'll get a chance for this one, sure was cool. <br/>
Thanks for all for keeping up the hobby,<br/>
Peace and Happy Trails,<br/>
The Woodwoses,<br/>
