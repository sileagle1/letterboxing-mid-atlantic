very excited, in fact I think I made his week. After a foray into a couple<br/>
of the New Jersey State Forests - Brendan Byrne (formally Lebanon) and Penn<br/>
for letterboxing I took the train home and must have missed a couple of<br/>
ticks and they got inbedded. I took the ticks over to the doctor's office<br/>
because we here in RI know all about the dangers of  Lyme Disease. They sent<br/>
the ticks off for testing and put me on antibiotics for three weeks. The<br/>
Environmental Guy was so excited that I had brought in a "Lone Star" tick.<br/>
Guess they're not as common around here as I thought (looked like a dog tick<br/>
to me). Turns out one of my ticks had ehrlichiosis. He had to contact the<br/>
State of New Jersey and tell them what county it was found in. He was pretty<br/>
certain that this is the farthest east that ehrlichiosis has been found. I<br/>
guess I came pretty close to making his year. I was never tested myself so I<br/>
don't know if I ever had ehrlichiosis. So, watch out down there in NJ.<br/>
