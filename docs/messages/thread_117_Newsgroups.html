me straight.<br/>
<br/>
I mentioned in a previous post about starting a newsgroup about letterboxing. <br/>
 The advantages would be that all posts would be on a searchable online <br/>
archive accessible from any online computer anywhere.  It would eliminate the full <br/>
mailboxes we all get. And it would allow easy linkage of posts and responses <br/>
into threads which can be easier to follow than separate emails.<br/>
<br/>
I have since looked into the requirements for a newsgroup and the application <br/>
process looks tricky but not difficult.  It requires an application and a <br/>
discussion/waiting period followed by voting.  The voting would require us all to <br/>
send an email in a specifically prescribed manner showing our personal <br/>
interest in participating in a letterboxing newsgroup.<br/>
<br/>
I would be willing to pursue this if there was interest from the group.  I <br/>
realize I am new and believe me, I don't mean to step out of bounds here.  I'd <br/>
just like to gauge the interest level at this point and offer my services if <br/>
they can be of help to the group.<br/>
<br/>
If you are unfamiliar with newsgroups, check out this quick primer:<br/>
<a href="http://www.learnthenet.com/english/html/26nwsgrp.htm" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.learnthenet.com/english/html/26nwsgrp.htm</a><br/>
<br/>
You can access newsgroups from many ISPs including AOL or through other free <br/>
services like Google.<br/>
<br/>
As letterboxing continues to grow, so will the amount of email in our boxes <br/>
from LBNA, LBMA, etc.  This may be a way to centralize many faqs, clue posts, <br/>
discussions and other items of interest to the letterboxing community.<br/>
<br/>
I look forward to hearing from the community regarding this matter.<br/>
<br/>
Sincerely,<br/>
