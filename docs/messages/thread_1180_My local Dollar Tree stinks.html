Well, It's a long drive for fleur, but you could pop over here to <br/>
Dumont and check out the Food Basics on Madison Ave.<br/>
Not only is there a huge bin of l'box sized Milan at $1 each in the <br/>
dollar section, they carry the whole line, all sizes, in the <br/>
housewares. Also, there's my latest favorite with the catchy no-name: <br/>
Seal Freezer Dishwasher RECTANGULAR STORAGE CONTAINER (in four fonts, <br/>
no less) for $1 each.<br/>

Although no green lids, I also have a can of Fusion spray paint for <br/>

me not to expect them to carry the Milan boxes again.  He said that<br/>
they buy large lots of merchandise, usually discontinued or sell out<br/>
items,  as they become available and when the company sells out of<br/>
those items, that is all they will ever get.  Looks like we need to<br/>
find a new box.<br/>

name? so we are also saving that critical penny).  Stocked up on lots <br/>
of double packages of spiral bound index cards last week, and we are <br/>
testing "Wasil" brand plastic ware from that store (made in Chile, of <br/>
all places).  So far the Wasil has passed all tests including the <br/>
torrential downpour test, but it is a little on the large side.  We <br/>
found the smallest "Lock and Lock" box at Target, really heavy duty --<br/>
- at $2.99 a little on the pricier side, but a index card notebook <br/>
fits perfectly.  <br/>
<br/>
Of course, we have yet to place our first box.  We just can't seem to <br/>
bring ourselves even to let our first little HH go, which DS has had <br/>
ready and waiting in our backpack for weeks now.  Some kind of LBing <br/>
phobia about letting your first one go out into the cold harsh <br/>
world???<br/>
