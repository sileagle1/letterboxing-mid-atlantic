new boxer to our sport was fun - she's hooked on both boxing and West <br/>
Virginia.  <br/>
<br/>
Of course, the best part was having NJ Carole here and having time to <br/>
go out and play.  For the moment, while she's still on crutches, she is <br/>
moving slowly enough for me to keep up with her!  What a concept.<br/>
<br/>
The surprise for the week was finding a box with the first finder <br/>
signed in as Wanda and Pete F301!  Then we had to explain to our newbie <br/>
why we were so amazed.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks to all placers for giving us places to go and boxes to find.<br/>
