Delaware is requiring permits for geocaches and letterboxes.<br/>
<br/>
Caches in Lums Pond and Killens Pond, as well as the Mapsurfer #8 <br/>
letterbox on Pea Patch Island, were the problems cited. For <br/>
background, check geocaching.com fourms (search for posts over the <br/>
past year by NappingBears, a state park employee), and posts in the <br/>
Delaware Geocaching group on groups.msn.com.<br/>

This effects many of us in multiple states. It's each persons decision as to whether or not they want to comply. If not, they know the risks involved and have choosen to face them. Personally, I have several boxes in DE and quite a few in PA, several whose clues I haven't had a chance to list yet. I've known about PA's policy and form for about 1 year but haven't had the time to make it a priority. I think I will probably go with the permits eventually. But for now I know the consequences of leaving my boxes in place without permits. I think everyone will have to make their own decisions. I agree that the "two paths" thing is gonna be a pain, one of the reasons I'm not too sure about the permit in DE. Also, you have to have an image of the permit logo in your clues. I post on LBNA. I'm not sure it supports an embedded image. And I am sure as heck not going
 to create my own website. So, it's one of those things we will see more and more of and have to decide, eventually, to deal with it or accept the resulting consequnces should our boxes be found by park personnel. </div>

                    <div id="ygrps-yiv-2057470631">Let's start with a direct quote from one of the caching posts.<br/>
<br/>
"Please feel free to contact me if you have questions or comments -- <br/>
I'll keep an eye on the board here, or if you prefer, my e-mail at <br/>
work is <a href="mailto:christine.polo@..." rel="nofollow" target="_blank">christine.polo@...</a>, phone is (302) 739-9177."<br/>
<br/>
I've been following this a little over the past year through the <br/>
caching forum. While having a policy like this isn't ideal, things <br/>
could be worse. Last year, two park managers (Lums Pond and Killens <br/>
Pond) requested that all caches in their parks be pulled completely <br/>
with the intention of banning the activity. Ms. Polo (who has logged <br/>
30 cache finds online and can therefore be considered one of us, or <br/>
at least one of them) asked within the central parks office about an <br/>
overall policy, and was eventually assigned to the committee that <br/>
drafted the policy.<br/>
<br/>
As far as the multiple access part of this, the parks' concern is the <br/>
creation of spur or social trails. The theory is to get geocaches and <br/>
letterboxes farther off the trail. This quote from the caching forum <br/>
says it better than I can: "It's been my experience that caches 30 <br/>
feet off a main trail are more likely to develop a social trail via <br/>
the clearest means of access. A cache 200 feet from a trail will <br/>
likely never be accessed by exactly the same route by any two <br/>
finders. This also cuts down on the risk of the cache being <br/>
discovered accidentally." My experience is identical.<br/>
<br/>
This applies to letterboxes too. Even if the last clue is a pace and <br/>
bearing from a specific spot, the farther you go from the trail, the <br/>
more that the various finders' paths will disperse, as finders drift <br/>
offline here and there, or go around obstacles in different <br/>
directions. Spur trails were the reason that the two original park <br/>
managers sought to ban our hobbies altogether, and it's the one part <br/>
of this that should be taken most seriously.<br/>
<br/>
As far as the logo being added to the online clues, that seems <br/>
trivial and I suspect that if this is brought to Ms. Polo's <br/>
attention, that a text equivalent would be accepted. Someone might <br/>
ask about exceptions for mysteries, such as not posting the fee and <br/>
hunting info (still get the permit) to avoid spoiling a mystery. At <br/>
the same time, keep in mind that a park staff might treat a true <br/>
mystery different than something called a mystery for the purpose of <br/>
circumventing a rule.<br/>
<br/>
Based on the posts on the caching forum, no caches nor letterboxes <br/>
seem to have been removed yet. They intend to give several weeks <br/>
(maybe through the end of the peak summer season?) for everyone to <br/>
apply, then start chasing down owners of caches/boxes not in <br/>
compliance. Having said that, you might ask if a certain missing box <br/>
had caused a specific problem and was removed based on that problem.<br/>
<br/>
That's the long version of what I've picked up from the caching <br/>
forums. Happy letterboxing.<br/>

<div>Just keep your clues updated online so that if someone chooses to hunt 
  your boxes, the clues have the most up to date info. This effects many of us 
  in multiple states. It's each persons decision as to whether or not they want 
  to comply. If not, they know the risks involved and have choosen to face them. 
  Personally, I have several boxes in DE and quite a few in PA, several whose 
  clues I haven't had a chance to list yet. I've known about PA's policy and 
  form for about 1 year but haven't had the time to make it a priority. I think 
  I will probably go with the permits eventually. But for now I know the 
  consequences of leaving my boxes in place without permits. I think everyone 
  will have to make their own decisions. I agree that the "two paths" thing is 
  gonna be a pain, one of the reasons I'm not too sure about the permit in DE. 
  Also, you have to have an image of the permit logo in your clues. I post on 
  LBNA. I'm not sure it supports an embedded image. And I am sure as heck no t 
  going to create my own website. So, it's one of those things we will see more 
  and more of and have to decide, eventually, to deal with it or accept the 
  resulting consequnces should our boxes be found by park personnel. </div>

&gt; Just keep your clues updated online so that if someone chooses to <br/>

effects many of us in multiple states. It's each persons decision as <br/>
to whether or not they want to comply. If not, they know the risks <br/>
involved and have choosen to face them. Personally, I have several <br/>
boxes in DE and quite a few in PA, several whose clues I haven't had <br/>
a chance to list yet. I've known about PA's policy and form for <br/>
about 1 year but haven't had the time to make it a priority. I think <br/>
I will probably go with the permits eventually. But for now I know <br/>
the consequences of leaving my boxes in place without permits. I <br/>
think everyone will have to make their own decisions. I agree that <br/>
the "two paths" thing is gonna be a pain, one of the reasons I'm not <br/>
too sure about the permit in DE. Also, you have to have an image of <br/>
the permit logo in your clues. I post on LBNA. I'm not sure it <br/>
supports an embedded image. And I am sure as heck no t going to<br/>

<br/>
Don't most boxes contain an email or snail mail<br/>
address to contact the placer?  Seems like it would be<br/>
friendlier to inform the placer that a permit is now<br/>
required as a warning before removing the box,<br/>
especially considering how many boxers frequent these<br/>
parks.<br/>
<br/>
Those entry fees add up when you start crossing state<br/>
lines and don't have a park pass.  I know my park pass<br/>
has already paid for itself between lb's and concert<br/>
series'.<br/>

&gt; That was my thought.  If they are going to have<br/>
&gt; rules, I would image someone will be checking to<br/>
&gt; ensure that the rules are adhered to.  Boy wouldn't<br/>
&gt; that be a tough job, checking the internet, going<br/>
&gt; letterboxing and getting paid for it!  Down side<br/>
&gt; would be having to remove them.<br/>
