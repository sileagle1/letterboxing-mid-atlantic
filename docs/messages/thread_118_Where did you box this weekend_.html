<div> </div>
<div>I had planned to hunt Silent Doug's Dingman's Falls series but work intruded on my letterboxing plans and I didn't get up to the Poconos until Saturday eveing. However, Sunday I was able to find Silent Doug's Alder Leaf box alive and well in Tobyhanna State Park. A picture perfect day at a nice park with fun trails. Thanks for the box Doug!</div>
<div> </div>
<div>So today I return to my office after teaching all day and there is a book on my desk with my (work) friend Michael's name in cartouche on the front. I've been talking to Mike for a couple of months about letterboxing as I am sure he would love it. The challenge is he doesn't drive but I promised to take him with me sometime soon. I must say I had ulterior motives for recruiting Mike. He's a very creative person and loves puzzles, etc. I thought I could use him to help H&amp;H find some mystery boxes! So I showed him Fleur de Lis very creative and intellegent Ben Franklin series clues which are not 15 minutes from where we work. Mike and I were supposed to go letterboxing this Saturday, 6/5/04 for this series. His first time out, I was going to show the "rookie" the ropes. We talked about his id stamp and he advised he already has a rubber stamp cartouche of his name, cool! So, back to this book on my desk. I open it up and there are the clues to the Ben Franklin boxes
 folded in there and 4 OF THE 5 IMAGES!! Turns out Mike couldn't wait and told his room mate and they were out boxing all weekend, and found every box they seached for. Then I turn the page and see the very distinctive stamp of who else...Silent Doug! and Jennifer! Mike ran into them on the trails. Well this guy is bouncing off the walls with glee and was going back after work to get the very last Ben Frankling image. I have created (another) monster! So while I was not as successful as I had hoped to be, one of my recruits had a fabulous weekend and is now coming to the LBMA Camping weekend in July. Thanks to all,</div>

This weekend was one of the nicest I can remember in a long time.  We<br/>
didn't find any new Lb's in the area but we did check on all my boxes<br/>
and all were safe and sound.  Whoo Hoo (none mysteriously stolen this<br/>
time).  I even got to plant another one - for a total of 6 now.  <br/>

&gt;  <br/>
&gt; We Did manage to find 3 local boxes this weekend (2 of which are <br/>
&gt; Geocache/Letterbox hybrids - one of daddy's toys!) and put together <br/>
&gt; the ingredients for two that will need to be placed soon. Also <br/>
mounted<br/>
&gt; some stamps for future planned placements. <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Took the little magwai and boss lady along on #2, and they seemed <br/>
to <br/>

<div>Not only check the website for updated clues, but actually READ the clues thoroughly BEFORE setting out, something I have not yet learned to do! A few weeks ago I emailed Silent Doug about his Alder Leaf box and mentioned how l-o-n-g the hike is and told him we figured out a way to cut it down from 5 miles a a little over 2. He said that hint was at the bottom of the directions and wisely stated "see Irene, it pays to read the clues completely before setting out". Wise words from a wise man. So this weekend Mr. Irene and I went down to Patapsco Valley State Park in MD where there are about 157 boxes (okay, I exaggerate a bit, maybe about 10-12) and I took the clues for the Apple Dumpling Gang's  "Box the Planet", one of the boxes in the McKeldin area I didn't get last time. That along with a couple of the "Maryland, My Maryland" series. So we set out on Saturday, arrive at the area, park the car and I get the clues out of my pack and read "after you have found the last
 box in the Maryland, My Maryland" series, continue along the trail.....Argh!!! I didn't have the other clues with me! So I am having a friggin conniption fit when my darling husband sweetly says to me "Well hon, we can still hike without having a letterbox to search for, it'll be fun". I looked at him like he had 7 heads, the man is obviously deranged. but that's what we did and it was okay. Sunday went much better, Drove to the Avalon Area and found Thomas Viaduct and Little Turtle which was on one of the prettiest trails ever, the Cascades Trail. Nice little waterfall and great picnic spot. So I didn't get as many boxes as I had hoped but had a great time with a great guy, and yes, Silent Doug was right, it pays to read the clues thoroughly BEFORE setting out! </div>

Don't worry, it only has to happen 3 or 4 times before you figure out that <br/>
reading the clues first is generally a good thing. So after your trip to <br/>
Patapsco, you only have 1 or 2 more unprepared adventures to look forward <br/>
to....<br/>

<div>Did you see Silent Doug and Jennifer got 16 boxes yesterday in that heat??!! I got heat stroke just READING about it. We are all just a bunch of wannabes compared to them., LOL!! I don't think I have ever even searched for 16 boxes in a month! </div>
<div> </div>
<div>I am torn about next weekend. Jerry Garcia's annual birthday bash is in WV and three of my favorite bands are there, String Cheese Incident, Railraod Earth and Bela Fleck and I am thinking of heading down early Saturday to catch the show. But I am going to see The Dead on Sunday with my baby boy (20yrs old) Bob and feel I should go boxing with my sister and her family on Saturday. She and my neice Nettie came to the gathering and really enjoyed themselves. Last weekend they hunted for Silint Doug's Ridley Creek box and couldn't find it. (See! It's not my fault, it's in our genes!). So they want me to come help them search next Saturday. Like I'm really gonna help them find it. Ha! I couldn't find the 2nd Brandywine Springs box that Silent Doug and Jennifer just found, how the heck and I going to help them? I can't find my car keys most days. </div>

I haven't either! Kudos to them :) I was actually doing really well <br/>
in the heat with no water yesterday, but Joe didn't seem to share my <br/>

Tonight I had my first go at my Lance Armstrong HH. It looked pretty <br/>
good, but then I realized that I carved Lance's name backwards! (So <br/>
that I could see it fine, but it stamped backwards!) D'oh! Tried to <br/>
fix it a bit, but I'm not super happy with it. <br/>
<br/>
I'm excited to get our HH race going! :) :)<br/>

<div> </div>
<div>I am sure Lance will be great and will take and hold the lead at once he hits the Rocky Mountains.But remember, Speed Racer's got the Mach 5 and a really cool theme song to boot! Those of you under 45 will probably not remember but it was "the bomb" when I was a kid. Everybody sing along!</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Here he comes, here comes Speed Racer. He's a demon on wheels.</div>
<div>He's a demon and he's gonna be chasin' after someone.</div>
<div>He's gainin' on ya so you'd better look alive</div>
<div>He's busy revvin' up the powerful Mach 5!</div>
<div>And when the odds are against him and there's dangerous work to do,</div>
<div>You bet your life Speed Racer, he will see it through.</div>
<div>Go Speed Racer, Go Spped Racer, Go Speed Racer go!</div>
<div> </div>
<div>There funny thing is MTV ran Speed Racer re-runs about 5 years ago and I stayed up to watch them....and it really sucked!!! The animation and story is terrible! But the theme song was still cool. I learned a life lesson though: Never try to re-live anything from your childhood. It's never as good as you remember it. Except for Warner Bros. cartoons. They withstand the test of time. Now my favorite grown up cartoon is Space Ghost Coast to Coast...hey sounds like an idea for a series! Space Ghost, Brack, Zorak and Moltar. Hmm...lemme go see if Carvin' Carmen is still up! 'Nite all!</div>

always having to carve my stamps twice -- until I started gluing them <br/>
to a mount -- then any wordy parts get cut off and I just carve a new <br/>
wordy part.  But I have improved some, I generally realize my mistake <br/>
just after tracing the design -- so now I only use vellum (from the <br/>
scrapbooking supplies) and can just flip it over!!! before I lead it <br/>
up.  Trick I learned in college is to lead/graphite the design and <br/>
then with just a couple drops of ligterfluid (in the yellow can) on a <br/>
kleenex gently wipe over the graphite.  It will keep it from smearing <br/>
when you are doing the transfer onto the rubber (for which I use one <br/>
of those embossing tools (again over in the scrapbooking dept) with <br/>
the tiny metal nib.)<br/>

The Woodwooses made a trip to DC to on Sat. Papa, Mama, Brother, Baby <br/>
girl, and Grandma Woodwooses all in MAD heat! Wow, Grandma and <br/>
Brother will be going home to the Dallas TX area tomorrow, (to <br/>
hopefully carry the letterbox habit we infected them with down <br/>
there). They wanted to see some DC sites and hit some boxes. We <br/>
wanted to go around the tidal basin and down to Hains Point, but the <br/>
heat kept us on the Mall. We went for:<br/>
"Skull And Bones"-totally MIA. I am sure we were in the right spot, <br/>
but from litter and debris under bushes I believe that homeless had <br/>
been using spot and taken the box. The spot was there, slight hollow <br/>
in ground with piece of log next to it, but no box. I think we can <br/>
call this one actually missing.<br/>
"Orion the Hunter"!-FOUND! Yay! This was our 1st microbox and we <br/>
located the bush and I could'nt spy it, just as I gave up, Mama and <br/>
Brother scored it. Mr. Einsten was very busy with lots of vistors so <br/>
taken it away to be stamped and replacing it was lots of fun and <br/>
quite a trick! We loved it!<br/>
PLANTED FREEDOM FEATHER! Yep, my first created microbox. I made it <br/>
from what I had read on the web and was proud of the creation after <br/>
finding "Orion" that I had done it so right! Hard plant and I wish I <br/>
had velcro. I apologize to all those who hunt this one, because the <br/>
retrival should be a bit of a trick. Clues to come out soon, along <br/>
with "George's little box", located on on Mt. Vernon, been a bit of a <br/>
procrastinator. <br/>

We found 5 boxes in the Denver, CO, area this weekend, which puts me <br/>
over F300 (I think).<br/>

Finished up the Ben Franklin series yesterday and Joseph's PPP series. Went to a great party last night and this morning(ish-we got there late, Mr. Irene's fault!) met up with Sheba, Willaholdme and Cowsmart, collectively "Wilmco" as I call them, plus Mr. Irene and a couple of my buddies from Commander Cody Caving Club and went boxing in the White Clay Creek areea. We found "Spell Check" with the snazzy new stamp, first finders on "Candy Cane" and found the "Wolf Box". All were in great shape but Wolf Box's log was full so we left behind a blank replacement and will notify the placer. I really enjoyed Suzanne's girls (I only have boys at home now) so it was fun hanging out with them</div>

<div>We were supposed to meet up with Julebee but it didn't work out. But I didn't find all of the boxes I wanted to in Newark so I now have some to hunt with her!</div>
<div> </div>
<div>I REALLY am done boxing now until the 26th. My house is a wreck and I've got to suck it up and act like an adult for the next two weeks. Not sure if I can pull it off....</div>

Washington Ballet's "The Nutcracker." We left early enough that we had time to help <br/>
someone who had run out of gas near Harrisburg. Although we had left plenty of time for <br/>
finding a few boxes along the way, we neglected to allow time to eat. I was getting pretty <br/>
grumpy with low blood sugar until we saw some great wildlife along the Potomac; 5 great <br/>
blue herons, at least one kingfisher, many geese, ducks, and fresh beaver chews! I told <br/>
RGBisMe that if I started to get grumpy again, just remind me of the beaver chews. That <br/>
worked like a charm until we could finally get a meal near the theater. We were able to find <br/>
"Maryland Black Eyed Susan", "Teddy Bear", and "Orion the Hunter" whose log is full but to <br/>
which we added another loose page.<br/>

A very enjoyable day, one of the best appreciated meals, and a super performance of The <br/>
Nutcracker.<br/>

Allentown parks (especially Trexler and Cedar Beach) have a problem <br/>
with Canada Geese that people feed and lose their deisre to migrate.  <br/>
fat, lazy geese doing you know what...  About 15 years ago, the mayor <br/>
at the time had a bunch of 'em rounded up and shipped to South <br/>
Carolina.  We were goose free for about 1 season, before the goose <br/>
feeders re-established themselves and the goosey doo came back.<br/>
<br/>
We kid around for a 1 day huntin' season!<br/>

<div>I would estimate 30 or 35 people but some people joined us enroute and others left along the way.  They expected maybe 50 so it could have been that many at times.  We stopped off at MusicWoman's house for hot chocolate, cookies &amp; exchanges (very sweet of her to have us all).  The evening ended at a pizza place where we had a room to ourselves and continued exchanging.  And...guess who was there?  Our very own Silent Doug &amp; Jennifer!!!  Doug said to say hello to all of you from him so HELLO!</div>
<div>And I'm happy to report, this Drive By put Warcat 76 at 204 finds!  We also now have 101 exhanges.</div>
<div>Sorry we won't be meeting you this weekend, but when the rally is rescheduled, we'll be there.</div>

Winky, Sheba of Team Wilmcoe, Cyclonic, MizScarlet and Buckaroo Bonzai as well as yours truly and my friend Jennifer all showed up to watch Alan, who was just great! I had one too many maritni's and started channeling one of my ancestors who was either a truck driver or a longshoreman, anyway, sorry for all the bad language! But I sure did have fun.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>On Saturday Jennifer and I, along with our hangovers and Dude, went letterboxing. It was Jennifer's first time out and she loved it. With some very gentle nudging from Sheba we found Cow Do You Do and Milk and Cookies. Both were in great shape and we really enjoyed the hike. Then we tried to find "To a Good Joe" but just didn't get the clues. I know we were on the right road, but beyond that we just weren't getting it. We'll have to try another time. But Jennifer had a great time and will definately go again.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Today Dude and I spent a lovely day hunting Harry Potter's Unicorn. We mis-read the clues some but still found the box. It was pretty wet but the log was fine so we dried everything out, replaced some bags and put the Unicorn back in his hiding spot.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Next weekend Mr. Irene is taking me to DC for my birthday to go letterboxing. We'd love to meet up with some DC area boxers for exchanges, etc. Email me off list if you're interested.</div>

Nada for me.  Rain on Sat forced us to stay indoors (but carve some AT <br/>
box stamps that Cyclonic and I will plant sometime).  Church stuff and <br/>
a kiddy soccer game on Sun prevented anything boxious.  The youngest <br/>
laid a guilt trip on Tom and me about finding an event box at a May <br/>

So I drove up and down her road for awhile "looking for signs of May Day merry making on the right" but couldn't see her place through the trees. Finally I gave up and called LB and lo and behold I was pretty much right at her house. Great party and I actually got to watch a May pole demonstration. I've never seen one, it was really neat. Found the box with lot's of gentle nudging from Judy (Dude and I haven't been boxing in a couple of weeks, I think he's getting rusty). Anyway, a great time on a great day. Oh, and the stamp was gorgeous!</div>

State Park and then Billy Boy and I headed for the May Day gathering<br/>
also.  We received a bath from Luna, Judy's dog, and found the box<br/>

covered in mud from our Tyler Park adventures.  So, three boxes in<br/>
good shape and one new stamp for our collection.  I am pretty happy<br/>

Hi.  I'm  happy to be part of the group.  Thank you, Irene for inviting me<br/>
and giving me that kind introduction. I'm not usually real talkative on<br/>
groups, but I'll be lurking around reading the digests.  I am looking<br/>
forward to meeting more of the group at a gathering some time this summer.<br/>

behind Wisconsin Hiker and Martini Man by 2 days. I'm pretty sure I'll<br/>
be breaking out in poison ivy in a few days, and our dog had 2 ticks<br/>

more already embedded on him!!<br/>

<br/>
A "T" Count for ticks found on the body after letterboxing.<br/>
<br/>
And an "R" Count for the ticks that actually had to be removed.<br/>
<br/>
Perhaps these stats should be associated with the box, not the boxer.  So each clue would <br/>
have it's T &amp; R average in addition to the usual caveats like difficulty, terrain, coyotes, etc.<br/>

Boyds while the Circus was still in town.  Our big adventure this weekend <br/>
was that while Mike was standing very manly, with one foot on a log, I <br/>
noticed that under his foot were two ends of a snake writhing around!  What <br/>
are the odds?  I FREAKED OUT but was unable to talk, just gesticulate and <br/>
utter gibberish.  When he finally noticed, he jumped about 3 vertical feet!  <br/>
Luckily, he was standing close enough to the head that it couldn't turn <br/>
around and bite him, although it was trying.  It turned out to be a harmless <br/>
kind with vertical stripes - is that a striped garter snake?<br/>
<br/>
Harmless, yes, but still a 2 foot snake.  I don't care much for them and was <br/>
quite shaken - it was about 20 mins before I got my knees back and gingerly <br/>
returned to the trail.  After that, I decided to poke a stick into any piles <br/>
of rocks and holes in trees before retreiving any boxes...<br/>

I still can't believe Mike was standing on a snake...  "HUH?  What's wrong?" <br/>

I'm afraid feelings are being hurt on all sides.  It's just a hobby, <br/>

anybody else.  Wouldn't we feel better to just enjoy the boxing than to <br/>
keep trying to prove a point--which really doesn't have a right or wrong <br/>

I am personally on the fence about the issue, but have serious mis-givings.  But when <br/>
'boxers I respect like Amanda and Scarab are doing it, perhaps there is something I'm <br/>
missing.<br/>
<br/>
If this is the future, perhaps I should gather up all my clues now for future use on a pay-<br/>

<br/>
There are no rules in this game.  The only guiding principal seems to be consideration for <br/>
others.   I'm happy with that idea.  I would never suggest that something "not be allowed."  <br/>
But I might point out that something is rude or inconsiderate.  I'm not suggesting that this <br/>
is, but what if many 'boxers felt so?  Should Ryan and Amanda know that, too? <br/>
<br/>
Can we at least discuss it?<br/>

I appreciate this discussion - it's always good to be able to toss<br/>
things around a bit and discuss them.<br/>
<br/>
My two cents:<br/>
 $.01 - I'm not offended by Premium Member clues on Atlasquest - in<br/>
the same way that I'm not offended by WoM clues. I don't think it's<br/>
the future of the game, just another aspect of the game that has<br/>
become available. To me, one of the neat things about letterboxing is<br/>
the many varied ways it is played. I doubt I'd ever post a premium<br/>
members only clue simply because I live in SJ, where the boxes and<br/>
(seemingly) boxers are few and far between. I think I'd be too hungry<br/>
for visitors! The idea of a WoM or limited availability clue does<br/>
sound like fun to me, though! (Maybe if I lived and planted in Bucks<br/>
County . . .) It just seems to me that members only clues on<br/>
Atlasquest is kind of a way to organize some WoM clues. I would hope<br/>
that people who are posting members only clues are also planting and<br/>
posting boxes that are regularly available also - like Amanda from<br/>
Seattle! I also hope that people will respect her wishes about not<br/>
sharing a non-public clue - in the same way that they would<br/>
(hopefully) be careful not to spoil a mystery box's location.  I would<br/>
hate to see a respected boxer who gives so much to the letterboxing<br/>
community disregarded like that.<br/>
<br/>
  $.01 - I did become a Premium Member, but lord knows it wasn't for<br/>
the premium members only clues - I can hardly get out of the house any<br/>
more between the baby's naps! I really like the setup of Ryan's site<br/>
and the many new features that continue to be added based on the<br/>
requests of the users. I appreciate the time and hard work that goes<br/>
into a site like that, and felt that I wanted to help support his<br/>
work, as a thank you to him. If LBNA had such a donation possible, I'd<br/>
make that, too! <br/>
<br/>
On another note: since I've been home so much missing letterboxing,<br/>
I've been doing a lot of planning and carving, so be prepared to see<br/>
the box count in SJ jump very soon! I do intend to lure some of you PA<br/>
boxers over here! <br/>
<br/>
In boxing fun . . .<br/>

<div>I think people have done all right discussing it. I haven't seen anything I would call bickering or name calling or impugning (there you go spelling stuff correctly again). I don't think it is going to be "the future" of boxing. I think that most boxes will remain available to everyone. I think there's room for both. And as was pointed out, the premium boxes are a very small percentage of the number of boxes on Atlas quest. </div>
<div> </div>
<div>Actually, if you want to have a discussion on the future of boxing, I am more concerned with over saturation of boxes in areas to the point where it almost becomes "inbred".  Probably not the right word, but I can't think of another one right now. What fun is it if you can go out in one day and just casually find 20 boxes? That's just about numbers. And there are lots of "special" boxes around like backstage at plays. That's not a find. I worry more about newspaper articles taking away the "underground" aspect of the hobby and making it mainstream than a few boxes being offered only to people who pay for Premium service on Atlasquest. I think that is more apt to eventually ruin the hobby. </div>

the NE crew comes to grips with overpublicity.  It may someday happen <br/>
here, but we are perhaps saved by the fact that we do not have "A car <br/>
in every garage, a chicken in every pot and a letterbox in every acre <br/>
of parkland."  That draws in the media, so perhaps we are blessed to <br/>
not have soooo many (well, maybe lower Bucks Co, PA).<br/>

&gt; I'm starting to feel the same way.  In the immortal words of Rodney <br/>

State College where we found True Indigo's Magical Mystery Tour boxes,<br/>
her Summer Fun 2 and her Be Our Guest HHH.  Ironically, I just picked<br/>
any HH out and didn't look at it till I got it home and thought it was<br/>
amusing that it was my friend, Lightnin' Bug's, My Dawgs are Barkin HH.<br/>

Then on Sunday, Barney, leader of Team Little Dog, and I traveled to<br/>
the Doylestown area to visit Peace Valley Nature Center but were<br/>
absolutely shocked!! that they would not allow pets.  It was kind of<br/>
funny that it said "pets" and not dogs, so if you are planning on<br/>
taking your goldfish boxing with you, forget it!  We adjusted our<br/>
plans and instead found Happy, Happy Birthday by Lotus, Capital Tile<br/>
#248 by Silent Doug and Indigo Vulture's Ring Ding a Ding.<br/>
<br/>
As a side note, when we found the Be Our Guest HHH, I also found my<br/>
200th box!  I was so happy that it was one of my good friend's boxes<br/>
that I found it on.  <br/>

My weekend?<br/>
I went out to check on my Palisades series yesterday, which I hadn't <br/>
done completely since planting it (checked on the last box from the <br/>
wrong end of the trail... cheat...cheat). Because it was the <br/>
scariest hard hike I'd ever taken and didn't want to go back. Wayne <br/>
was eager to see it, since I only had 3 kids along for planting, and <br/>
it was a hike he'd wanted to do for a long time and they said it was <br/>
sooooo much fun. Well, the boxes are fine, but I was right. I'll <br/>
check up on 1,2, and 4, but I can't face those boulders again. (At <br/>
least not while dehydrated and getting a headache. Dizzy and cliffs <br/>
should not happen together.)<br/>
<br/>
So, anybody got some nice FLAT trails to recommend?<br/>

Mileston Find at a fellow Hairy Legger's box - Indigo Vulture's <br/>
first of 3 cats....<br/>
<br/>
That was Friday and Tom and I did some Dr. Who and Cats and hid the <br/>
Pig, Rat and Rabbit to finish the Chinese Zodiac.<br/>
<br/>
Sunday, I was joined by Eagle Bob and the newest Hairy Legger, <br/>
Sheba, to conquer Mt. Tammany in NJ to find one of the oldest LB's <br/>
in the USA that is still functioning (Jan 99) and the Bench Box <br/>
Blues.  We also had some side diversions which some may know <br/>
about....<br/>
<br/>
Sheba has reached a new elevation milestone in her life; Mt. Tammany <br/>
is 1527 ft. and about a 1300 ft climb from where we parked.<br/>

picked<br/>

was<br/>
&gt; amusing that it was my friend, Lightnin' Bug's, My Dawgs are <br/>
Barkin HH.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Then on Sunday, Barney, leader of Team Little Dog, and I traveled <br/>
to<br/>
&gt; the Doylestown area to visit Peace Valley Nature Center but were<br/>
&gt; absolutely shocked!! that they would not allow pets.  It was kind <br/>
of<br/>
&gt; funny that it said "pets" and not dogs, so if you are planning on<br/>
&gt; taking your goldfish boxing with you, forget it!  We adjusted our<br/>
&gt; plans and instead found Happy, Happy Birthday by Lotus, Capital <br/>
Tile<br/>
&gt; #248 by Silent Doug and Indigo Vulture's Ring Ding a Ding.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; As a side note, when we found the Be Our Guest HHH, I also found my<br/>
&gt; 200th box!  I was so happy that it was one of my good friend's <br/>
boxes<br/>
&gt; that I found it on.  <br/>

Thirty feet of elevation does not constite a hill. Of course Aud <br/>

&gt; <br/>
&gt; My weekend?<br/>
&gt; I went out to check on my Palisades series yesterday, which I <br/>
hadn't <br/>
&gt; done completely since planting it (checked on the last box from the <br/>
&gt; wrong end of the trail... cheat...cheat). Because it was the <br/>
&gt; scariest hard hike I'd ever taken and didn't want to go back. Wayne <br/>
&gt; was eager to see it, since I only had 3 kids along for planting, <br/>
and <br/>
&gt; it was a hike he'd wanted to do for a long time and they said it <br/>
was <br/>
&gt; sooooo much fun. Well, the boxes are fine, but I was right. I'll <br/>
&gt; check up on 1,2, and 4, but I can't face those boulders again. (At <br/>
&gt; least not while dehydrated and getting a headache. Dizzy and cliffs <br/>
&gt; should not happen together.)<br/>

Sounds like the "causeway" that connects our church camp, New Life <br/>
Island, to the Pa side of the Delaware. When the water's obviously too <br/>
high, you park in the lot (by H&amp;H's Tinicum boxes - you may have <br/>
noticed it) and use the footbridge. When it's obviously low, you drive <br/>
over. But there's this awkward in-between stage that is drivable but <br/>
scary.<br/>
