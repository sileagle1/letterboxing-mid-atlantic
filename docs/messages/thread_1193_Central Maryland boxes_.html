<div><strong><font face="Papyrus">Hi, I am a newbie also, here are the pages where 
central maryland and cecil county are listed. I can't tell you if any of them 
are there or not as I have not gone for any yet.  We started to go for the 
Turkey Point Lighthouse one last week, but after getting out there to the point, 
we had to turn around and head right back as it started to thunder.  We 
made it back and before we could even back out of the lot, it started 
downpouring... we will have to go back there again.  My youngest is almost 
3, we had to take turns piggy backing her on the way back as she got a blister 
on her foot on the way out there.  </font></strong></div>

<br/>
Here is the link to the newcomers message board,<br/>
<a href="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/newboxers/." rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://groups.yahoo.com/group/newboxers/.</a>  This is a board where you<br/>
can ask a lot of questions about getting started without bogging down<br/>
the regular message boards with questions that have been asked many<br/>
times before.<br/>
<br/>
Also, even though not finding boxes occasionally is all part of the<br/>
game, one way that I check to see if a box is still available is to<br/>
check the last date found on the letterboxing.org website.  For<br/>
example, if it hasn't been found in a year, I might guess that it is<br/>
not there anymore and decide if I want to take the time to check it<br/>
out or to look for one that has been found more recently.  To use this<br/>
feature, you need to be a registered member of the website, something<br/>
that is really easy to do, just fill in the form.  Then you will need<br/>
to go to the member services page and go to "set your preference" and<br/>
enable the "letterbox status - others".  This allows you to see the<br/>
most recent date that a box was found when you view the clues.<br/>
<br/>
You can also do the same thing on the atlasquest.com website.<br/>
<br/>
Good luck and we will look for you on the newcomers board,<br/>
