<div><font face="Arial" size="2">As some of you may know, Dave and I also have 
another hobby - the Society for Creative Anachronism. We try to combine the two 
hobbies by looking for boxes on the way to or from Events. This year we're 
hoping to again attend the big Pennsic War in Western Pennsylvania. We're 
printing off clues for the counties along the route and hope to get a few 
boxes along the way.  Unfortunately the War itself does not allow 
daytrippers and can be kind of expensive if you're not attending the War, but if 
there are any other people crazy enough to be both Letterboxers and SCAdians 
attending the War - we would love to meet up with you. We will be camping with 
Aleholding in the Highlands and will at least have a stamp or two to share with 
any Letterboxers who find us.</font></div>

<br/>
*shreeks emit as a comfy pillow is placed softly under the buttocks*<br/>
<br/>
Enough, please sir, enough.  I confess... oh please, I do confess. <br/>
There shalt be, as you say sir, an image so cleverly hidden amoungst <br/>
the combatants of the great clash between the kingdoms of the East and<br/>
the Middle.  *scream of agony as another pillow is applied*<br/>
<br/>
Speak, dog, where is it hidden?  How shall it be found?<br/>
<br/>
*moans as the sight of a comfy chair moves into view*<br/>
<br/>
Oh, sir, no no, please... not that!  Not the... comfy chair!<br/>
<br/>
*the Inquisitor leans over the victim's shoulder, whispering in his<br/>
ear*<br/>
<br/>
Then tell me what I want to know.<br/>
<br/>
*the victim, known only as the Christmas Peasent, looks up with a <br/>
toothless grin*<br/>
<br/>
Clues will be posted at the main LBNA board on the 8th day of August, <br/>
A.S. XL.  That is when the bearer of the image is expected to arrive<br/>
at the site and swear arms to the king and his lady, the queen. <br/>
Anyone already attending shall be able to access the clues at the <br/>
Mystic Mail pavillion.<br/>
