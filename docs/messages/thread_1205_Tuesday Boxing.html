                    <div id="ygrps-yiv-330899163">Went to Cranford and environs today to pick up some of Rick in Boca's <br/>
stamps.  Very nice stamps and we loved seeing the "granite spray on, <br/>
stick a few leaves on" effect in person.  We had to give a pass to the <br/>
Echo Lake Park one, though, as the wasp nests were all over and we <br/>
were a little nervous about reaching into unknown places during this <br/>
time of year.<br/>
<br/>
We also did NJ Physiography 103.  We love this series and the initial <br/>
lookout was awesome -- over a huge gravel pit, with trucks going in <br/>
and out -- industry at its best but it did look like a little Tonka <br/>
truck display in miniature.  The rest of the hike made us forget about <br/>
it and get back to nature though.<br/>

                    <div id="ygrps-yiv-681784938">Thanks for the compliment on the boxes, B's. Yes, I sprayed a couple of <br/>
the boxes with granite speckled paint, then glued-on silk leaves. <br/>
<br/>
At Echo Lake Park you stick you hand up into the sculpture, and I can <br/>
see your hesitation. I also failed to check before planting it to see <br/>
if there is a Geocache there, and there certainly is, somewhere. So <br/>
maybe I'll move it before fall.<br/>
