We started out in search of the South Mountain Reserve letterbox from <br/>
the basement (in Millburn).  Hard hike uphill in this heat (and it was <br/>
no Mt Tammany, believe me!) -- seemed a lot longer than it really <br/>
was!  But no luck finding this box.  Has anyone found it recently?  <br/>
Just curious.<br/>
<br/>
Needed a few easier ones after that so we went to East Hills Park and <br/>
had lots of fun on the FitTrail, then headed to Far Hills Pharmacy and <br/>
had a deliciously cold root beer float while stamping in.<br/>
<br/>
Ended our day at NJ Hitchhiker Hostel.  Picked up two and left two, <br/>
including a newly released one, entitled "I Gotta Go".  What can I <br/>
say?  It reflects the gender bias of the B's, the majority of whom <br/>
found the stamp and double-entendre of the theme to be so tremendously <br/>
clever that they were willing to overlook the fact that it was a store-<br/>
bought stamp.<br/>
<br/>
Funny, that last point.  When we first started, we picked up lots of B <br/>
themed stamps from Michael's to plant.  And the more we boxed, the <br/>
more we realized how much we vastly preferred finding hand-carved <br/>
stamps.  So we ended up returning them all, except for the one <br/>
mentioned above.  Even the personal stamps have gradually been <br/>
converted over to B themed hand carved ones (though the B connection <br/>
might not be too obvious without explanation...)<br/>
<br/>
No more boxing this week.  Too much work to do around here.  At least <br/>
we had a good two day run!<br/>

The location for the NJ Hitchhiker Hostel is ideal. And I realized that <br/>
it is actually a drive-by; the path can be negotiated by a vehicle, and <br/>
because the picnic area is vacant during the week, there is little <br/>
chance of being observed. Note: the park ranger drives a big black <br/>
Mercedes.<br/>

<br/>
</span></blockquote>Here's the whole clue, for anyone interested.<br/>
Aud<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
South Mountain Reservation<br/>
This box is Unclaimed.<br/>
Placement date: May 1 2003<br/>
State: New Jersey<br/>
County: Essex<br/>
Nearest city: Milburn<br/>
Number of boxes: 1<br/>
<br/>
Clues<br/>
15 minutes on rocky incline and 20 minutes on paved path (see middle<br/>
of clue for lazy driving hint)<br/>
<br/>
On Glen Avenue in Millburn across from near where the bibliophiles<br/>
gather there is an opening in the woods marked by a sign that<br/>
says "Locust Grove". Drive in here and park.<br/>
<br/>
Bear right, on foot now, onto the Lenape Trail, through the picnic<br/>
area, past the roof on legs, and up the hill. Just follow, the<br/>
trail's trees are marked in yellow.<br/>
<br/>
When you get to a metal fence, bear right (you're still on the yellow<br/>
trail)<br/>
until you come to a paved road. Take a right here and as you walk,<br/>
enjoy the fresh air.<br/>
<br/>
You will be walking for about twenty minutes, through the white gates<br/>
past which cars are allowed, also past a semi-grassy parking area.<br/>
<br/>
You will know you're close when the road widens, and you see an<br/>
amazing overlook on the right. (The physically unfit, if good map-<br/>
readers, can park here and avoid the hill).<br/>
<br/>
Look at Manhattan, then stand reading the memorial rock bearing<br/>
George Bramhall's name. From this rock, turn towards the woods, and<br/>
walk into them, crossing the road on its race marker, going between<br/>
the two green benches onto the path.<br/>
<br/>
Almost immediately on your left you will see a tall light brown very<br/>
dead tree<br/>
(just a stone's throw from the benches) it has lost all its branches.<br/>
<br/>
All rhyming aside on the other side of this tree, there are two<br/>
stones piled<br/>
remove the upper one, and in the tree's hollow you will find the<br/>
letterbox. (Please put the rock back before you leave, thanks).<br/>

it a try, too. <br/>
<br/>
If the box is indeed still there, wouldn't it be appropriate to re-add<br/>
it to the LbNA inventory?<br/>

means you're not just posting the clue, but taking on the maintainence <br/>
responsibilies for the box. I would have adopted it myself after <br/>
finding, but spent a lot of last summer just running around checking <br/>
on my own boxes and didn't want to add another to the list. Now that <br/>
the little green flag thingies have been added to the website, I get a <br/>
lot more status reports via email, and run around a lot less.<br/>

didn't turn over every leaf, but I did turn over every stone near a <br/>
tall, dead tree. I forgot Audrey's hint that the tree was VERY <br/>
hollow; but every time I finished searching a very dead tree, I would <br/>
look up and see another. So I finally ran out of daylight.<br/>
<br/>
There is a large downed tree (light brown) that was probably it. It <br/>
is pretty well disintegrated by now. I don't own any tools (ax, hoe, <br/>
rake) to bring to bear on the mess that remains. <br/>
<br/>
This answers my question about how long it takes a hollow stump to <br/>
fall apart: evidently this one lasted two years, since the box was <br/>
planted in May 2003. <br/>
