                    <div id="ygrps-yiv-1027074969">I have received some emails from the superintendent of Hibernia Park<br/>
in Chester County about two boxes that I have planted there.  Here is<br/>
the first email that he sent:<br/>
<br/>
Please contact me at the Hibernia Park Office. I am need of more<br/>
information as it pertains to your "letter box". It is a requirement<br/>
that any "caches" that are placed within county park property be<br/>
approved by the Park Superintendent and the proper documentation<br/>
submitted.<br/>
<br/>
And a subsequent email:<br/>
The "permit", for a lack of a better word, provides the parks<br/>
department with information on items that are placed within parklands<br/>
for recreational enjoyment such as yours. I think that both the<br/>
letterboxes and Geocache are a exciting way to spend time in the park<br/>
and support them whole heartedly. This permit can be used for all of<br/>
our park sites and submitted directly to the superintendent at that<br/>
park for approval. The parks needs this information so if someone<br/>
unknowingly stumbles upon  these items and reports them to the park<br/>
office we know about them and they don't become a suspicious package.<br/>
<br/>
The superintendent that I have been dealing with has been super nice<br/>
and very supportive.  He emailed me the form and I submitted one for<br/>
each of my two boxes that I have placed in this park and they were<br/>
approved immediately.  I am going to add this form to the forms<br/>
section here for anyone else's use.  This applies only to the county<br/>
parks in Chester county, not any state parks.<br/>

Thanks for looking into this, as the first box I place will probably <br/>
be in Hibernia.  I also know that geocaches have been placed along <br/>
the Struble trail in Chester County, and their clues indicate that <br/>
permission is necessary to place them, and it apparently was granted.<br/>
<br/>
thanks again,<br/>

You talked about, but did not post a permit form for Chester <br/>
County.  Do you have a soft copy of the permit form, or should we <br/>
use the state form and give it to the local super?<br/>

&gt; &gt; You talked about, but did not post a permit form for Chester <br/>
&gt; &gt; County.  Do you have a soft copy of the permit form, or should we <br/>
&gt; &gt; use the state form and give it to the local super?<br/>
