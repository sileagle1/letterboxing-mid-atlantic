saw how much fun we are having and decided to join us for the exercise <br/>
at least.<br/>
<br/>
Only one stamp, but it was a mystery that has not been found in nearly <br/>
three years, and even then only a handful of people have found it.  I <br/>
had been to the place where I thought it was many many years before <br/>
and I had a sense of where it was -- even though it didn't appear to <br/>
be there at first, it was exactly where I had envisioned it.  Odd.<br/>
<br/>
Four days spent letterboxing out of the previous five.  A new record <br/>
for us.<br/>

We love mystery boxes.  We have learned tons about NJ (our primary <br/>
boxing state) from figuring them out and it is such a validation to <br/>
actually find the box waiting there for you!  I think this was our <br/>
4th or 5th but we have several more worked out, just waiting until <br/>
the right time to go and get them.  <br/>
