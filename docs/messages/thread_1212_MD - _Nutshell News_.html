on September 10 one of Montgomery County Maryland's regional parks,<br/>
Brookside Nature Center in Wheaton Regional Park, is hosting a "Family<br/>
Letterboxing Hike." I was surprised to (1) see such a public<br/>
letterboxing event hosted by the county and (2) see letterboxing<br/>
"endorsed" or "embraced" by the county.  Here's a link to the park's<br/>
site, but they're not quite up-to-date with all the fall events that<br/>
are in their printed catalog:<br/>
<a href="http://www.mcparkandplanning.org/parks/nature_centers/brookside/index.shtm." rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.mcparkandplanning.org/parks/nature_centers/brookside/index.shtm.</a><br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Ironically, one of the parks overseen by this division of the county<br/>
is Black Hills Regional Park -- site of Boch's Circus (May Gathering)<br/>
and a park that is teeming with boxes.  I think there's only a few in<br/>
Wheaton Regional Park  (which is a lovely facility -- butterfly<br/>
exhibit, small gauge train, antique carousel, horses/trail rides,<br/>
beautiful gardens and great nature center).<br/>
<br/>
I've taken my kids on several of the Nutshell News programs trying to<br/>
get to know the parks better and in the back of my mind trying to<br/>
scout out new ideas for box-plants.  I always felt like it was this<br/>
kind of sneaky, subversive thing -- and here they are leading the hike<br/>
for boxes!  <br/>
<br/>
It's probably a pretty smart move on their part to enable them to go<br/>
over how to best protect their paths and vegetation and what critters<br/>
we might expect off-trail.<br/>
<br/>
Maybe we'll be seeing some new boxes in the park and in the area!<br/>

Back in 2002 there was a boxer (Di of The Usual Suspects, where are <br/>
you?) who received permission from Brookside Gardens to place a <br/>
letterbox. I haven't checked to see if it's still there.</div>
