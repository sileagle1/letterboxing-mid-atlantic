<div>Hi,</div>
<div>Raindear here.</div>
<div>I haven't been that active lately, but I have been monitoring this site daily.</div>
<div>I will be camping in Green Lane Park (site of many of my boxes) next weekend.</div>
<div>Friday Aug 19 and Sat 20th.</div>
<div>Saturday night is also "movie under the stars" night with Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkhaban.  They set up a big sreen down near the lake in the park.  It's free.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Anyway, if anyone was planning to letterbox in that part of montgomery county next weekend, stop by for an exchange or hints on any of my boxes.  The campsite is behind the big parking lot near the pavilion.  We will be in campsite #38.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>I'll be doing maintenance and possibly replacing some (ugh) store bought stamps with some hand carved beauties.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Let me know if I should watch for you.</div>
