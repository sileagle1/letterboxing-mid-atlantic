placing boxes in prep for the Mystery Gather. Deep in a centuries old <br/>
hardwood forest... I was sweating profusely... my feet hurt... my <br/>
knees locked up... my back gave out... I was attacked by a tick.... <br/>
but she was relentless... "Press on! We have to get ready for the <br/>
Letterboxers!!!"...  that was the last thing I heard before I passed <br/>
out beneath an ancient oak... then Sewsew saved my life. She picked<br/>
me up put me on her shoulder and carried me back to the air <br/>
conditioned comforts of a local Country Club where the waitress gave <br/>
me cold beer until I regained my senses.<br/>
<br/>
We have information about one night FREE Camping at a beautiful park <br/>
(with new Letterboxes)very near the gathering place</div>

just a couple of miles from the campgrounds. At the intersection of <br/>
the Fairfax County Parkway &amp; I-95... Exit 166A<br/>
<br/>
This is an old family restaurant.. inexpensive.... one of a <br/>
kind ...not a chain.... conveniently located to any number of <br/>
Letterboxing destinations that Sunday<br/>
