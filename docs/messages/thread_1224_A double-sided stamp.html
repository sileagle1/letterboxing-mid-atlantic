I have never seen a stamp like it. This stamp is on hand- carved on <br/>
both sides, and both are the same image (an acorn), just carved out a <br/>
little differently. On one side is the background; the other side is <br/>
the detail. I carved this stamp because I was running out of erasers <br/>
to carve onto, and wanted to do both stamps. This probably took me <br/>
about an hour total; you just have to be sure that you use the same <br/>
stencil for drawing out the picture, or you will have an uneven stamp.</div>

markers are provided for coloring. I also included directions for <br/>
using it in the box/cache becuase of the cachers. if you want to see <br/>
the directions, e-mail me, and i'll send them back to you. In about <br/>
a month, I'll post again with how many logs I have so that you can <br/>
see how it goes.<br/>
