THE HOLIDAYS WILL BE HERE BEFORE YOU KNOW IT<br/>
(it will be October15th then):<br/>
<br/>
This may stick a thorn in some people's sides, but I would like to put<br/>
the request out to my fellow letterboxers, if they could please maybe<br/>
bring a "non-perishable" item that I would like to donate to the<br/>
Cherry Hill/Camden food bank. This is not an obligation, but if you do<br/>
bring something to donate you will get a "SPECIAL STAMP" that I carved<br/>
just for your special donation. Thank you very much.<br/>

<div>I think this is a wonderful idea.  Not sure whether or not I can make the gathering (my hubby can't) and I'm not sure I want to come alone but if I do, I'll certainly bring a few items for your food bank.  I'll let you know after I get back from vacation.</div>
