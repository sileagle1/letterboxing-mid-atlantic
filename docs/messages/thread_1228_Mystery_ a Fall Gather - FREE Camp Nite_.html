Mystery, a Fall Gather is at Pohick Bay Regional Park <br/>
(www.nvrpa.org/pohickbay).  A non-electric site for 4 people is <br/>
$21.25 (5th, 6th &amp; 7th persons are $2.50 ea).<br/>
<br/>
I picked up brochures from the Northern VA Regional Park Authority <br/>
and saw it included a COUPON (you know how I love coupons) for<br/>
"One Free Night of camping at Pohick Bay for up to four customers. <br/>
Valid 3/1/05 to 10/30/05. Void on holiday weekends."<br/>
<br/>
So if you are planning to camp and want a brochure (I have five) - <br/>
please email me OFF LIST (sowbiz @ yahoo . com) with your mailing <br/>
address --- <br/>
OR Call NVRPA directly 703.339.6104 and ask them to send you the <br/>
brochure with the coupon (they have other non-coupon brochures so be <br/>
specific.)  That may be faster since I will be in and out of town the <br/>
next few weeks.  But I'll mail to the first five asking by Sept 5th.<br/>
<br/>
And there will be a number of boxes planted in that park!  Admission <br/>
per car is $7/day for NON-Fairfax County Residents.  But I am one so <br/>
I'll try and form carpools for non-campers.  I would think the <br/>
admission is part of the camp fee -- but you should ask.<br/>
<br/>
Hope to see all ya'll at the Gather.  Keep checking the web site for <br/>
location clues update and box clues.<br/>
