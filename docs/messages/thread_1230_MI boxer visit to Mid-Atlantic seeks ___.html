                    <div id="ygrps-yiv-27874142">Hi everyone, <br/>
<br/>
Next month my mother-in-law and I will be coming from Mich to pick up<br/>
her Mother (Grandmom) in Bellmawr, NJ and driving to Jim Thorpe, PA to<br/>
stay at the Victoriann B&amp;B in the Pocono's for a week.<br/>
<br/>
I looked at the letterboxing.org site and don't see a single box<br/>
listed for Carbon County, PA!! Yikes... I'll be spending a whole with<br/>
2 elderly women and there are NO BOXES TO FIND!?  <br/>
<br/>
I've already started looking for clip art to carve a "tell me it ain't<br/>
so, Joe" letterbox to leave behind. LOL ... anyone want to adopt it<br/>
after I get it placed?<br/>
<br/>
Besides all that, does anyone know of any easy to find boxes that<br/>
might not be too far off our path of our planned trip?  I don't know<br/>
the exact route we'll take. So far all I've done is use map quest<br/>
route finder. (Any hints on the best route gratefully accepted!) <br/>
Please keep in mind my companions (Grandmom is going to be 95 this<br/>
year) when I say I need easy to find boxes.  I can't be locking them<br/>
in the trunk too long while I go hiking down the trail.  No wait ... I<br/>
can't say that in a public forum, can I? (Kidding -- I love both of<br/>
them to pieces, they're wonderful women) <br/>
<br/>
If anyone lives near Bellmawr, NJ and wants to have coffee the weekend<br/>
of 9/10 and do an exchange or even this Jim Thorpe, PA area of the<br/>
Pocono's or will be in the area 9/12 - 9/16 (I think those are the<br/>
dates) let me know.  I'd love to meet up with some fellow boxers. I've<br/>
got a couple of HH's I can give a big boost to and will be happy to<br/>
bring any HH's needing a ride to MI back with me.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks in advance for the help. I've never been to the Pocono's and<br/>
I'm looking forward to the time in your area.<br/>
<br/>
Enjoy!<br/>

boxes.  Some very easy, some brain teasers.  Some easy physically, <br/>
some rather hard work.  Contact me off line and I can make some <br/>
recommendations, depending upon you and your MIL desires.  I am <br/>
local to that part of the state, so if you want to hook up, please <br/>
drop me a line<br/>

Carbon County has a few known Mapsurfer Boxes in Hickoery Run State <br/>
Park and, as is typical, may have things that are not known.<br/>
