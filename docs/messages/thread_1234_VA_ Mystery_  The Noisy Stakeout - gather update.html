<div>Friday</div>
<div>11:01pm</div>
<div> </div>
<div>I was keeping the Boddy mansion under close survelience.  Trying to lay low and keep quiet to avoid discovery.  I don't know why I bothered. </div>
<div> </div>
<div>"Ow! Dang sticker bushes. I should never have given up my day job."</div>
<div> </div>
<div>"Hush. Please keep it down over there."</div>
<div> </div>
<div>"Me? Keep it dow... hey, these are my sticker bushes. Go find your own pesky thorns. Who the heck are you anyway," I grumbled.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>"Bond. James Bond.[stamp by Yuri Nahl]  Don't be A Study in Scarlet [by Sewsoobizzy] and hand me that shaker will you please."  </div>
<div> </div>
<div>"Some stake out this is."</div>
<div> </div>
<div>"Hey mister. Do you know where the next trail marker is?"</div>
<div> </div>
<div>"Aren't you kids supposed to be in school or something?!"</div>
<div> </div>
<div>"We're doing the kids scavenger hunt at the Mystery! gather while our folks are boxing. We're looking for The Cat Who... Hid in a Letterbox." [by Ladybug]</div>
<div> </div>
<div>"Get lost ya little monsters. And that's not part of your scavenger hunt anyway. This isn't a quiet stake out, it's a busman's convention."  </div>
<div> </div>
<div>"When you eliminate the impossible, whatever remains, however improbable, must be the truth," said an old fashioned voice.  </div>
<div> </div>
<div>"Who's the guy in the natty suit, pipe, and funny hat?" I whispered..</div>
<div> </div>
<div>"Deerstalker," Bond replied. "You mean...?"  "Yes."  [Sherlock Holmes by Chuck Straub]</div>
<div> </div>
<div>I gave up the night and headed back for a scotch.  "There are so many detectives here in this woods you can walk across the channel on them. I think I'll go out for a steak."</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Signed,</div>
<div>Nick Danger</div>
<div>Third Eye, Private Investigations</div>

<div> </div>
<div>- Stamps from all over on a Mystery! detective theme.</div>
<div>- Clue Exchange Game - "Death of a Salesman" on a product logo theme.</div>
<div>- kids scavenger hunt</div>
<div>- prizes</div>
<div> </div>
<div>"Hey Bond, aren't you a spy? I thought this was a detective show?" "Spies, mysterys, detectives. We're all alike. Shadows, running, gunshots, you know."</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Suddenly out of the shadows I heard running.  Then shots.  Blang, blang!</div>
