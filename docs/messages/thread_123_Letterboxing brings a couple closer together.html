<br/>
Just thought that I'd pass along something totally cool. A couple of<br/>
weeks ago, my son and I planted the Rodale Fitness Park Letterbox and<br/>
the Fat Dawg Hitchhiker. We got an email a few days later asking<br/>
for 'non-letterboxy' (non-compass-dependent) directions because the<br/>
person did not have a compass. He and his girlfriend were going<br/>
letterboxing in the afternoon of a particular day and he wanted to<br/>
sneak a surprise marriage proposal into the letterbox that morning.<br/>
His girlfriend is the compass-bearer.<br/>
<br/>
So, I had no problem in providing private alternate clues to such a<br/>
noble cause!<br/>
<br/>
Needless to say, the secret proposal stashed in the letterbox was a<br/>
success and our friend now has a fiance!<br/>
<br/>
Other good news is that the Fat Dawg is finally getting some exercise<br/>
and heading to the Philly area to mooch some cheesesteaks!<br/>
<br/>
I guess you can call it the 'feel good story of the week'.<br/>

I thought it was a proposal for some kind of radical change to the LBNA list and was intrigued. Turns out it was a marriage proposal with pictures that was just adorable. I think the lucky girl was called "pumpkin princess" or something. They're really cute pictures.<br/><br/><b><i>rpboehme &lt;rpboehme@...&gt;</i></b> wrote:
