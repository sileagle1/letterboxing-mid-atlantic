<div>Hi all,</div>
<div>Didn't see no snakes this weekend, but we have a major warning for Green Lane boxers.</div>
<div>We were hunting for Team Little Dog's "My Dream, My Reality" on Saturday.</div>
<div>I was with another dad, one of my girls and 2 of his kids.</div>
<div>We got to the expected spot behind a big dead tree.  We were surprised to see a copy of the clus sheet laying right there.  Then the other dad starting yelping and hopping around.  Followed closely by his daughter, then mine.</div>
<div>We were standing right on top of a yellow jacket nest.</div>
<div>I have never been pursued like that in my life.  They clung to our clothes for 100s of yards.</div>
<div>I kept swiping at my shorts, my boots, my daughter.  One went up her shirt, one in her bangs.  She got it worst, I think 10 stings.  I only got one.</div>
<div>Very scary.  Luckily no one was allergic.</div>
<div>I'd give that set of boxes a few months, maybe after the first frost before visiting.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>On a lighter note, I replaced two store bought stamps with 2 nicely hand carved ones.</div>
<div>If you haven't found Golden Oak or Red Maple, check them out.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Be careful out there.</div>

&gt; Didn't see no snakes this weekend, but we have a major warning for<br/>
Green Lane boxers.<br/>
&gt; We were hunting for Team Little Dog's "My Dream, My Reality" on<br/>
Saturday.<br/>
&gt; I was with another dad, one of my girls and 2 of his kids.<br/>
&gt; We got to the expected spot behind a big dead tree.  We were<br/>
surprised to see a copy of the clus sheet laying right there.  Then<br/>
the other dad starting yelping and hopping around.  Followed closely<br/>
by his daughter, then mine.<br/>
&gt; We were standing right on top of a yellow jacket nest.<br/>
&gt; I have never been pursued like that in my life.  They clung to our<br/>
clothes for 100s of yards.<br/>
&gt; I kept swiping at my shorts, my boots, my daughter.  One went up her<br/>
shirt, one in her bangs.  She got it worst, I think 10 stings.  I only<br/>
got one.<br/>
&gt; Very scary.  Luckily no one was allergic.<br/>
&gt; I'd give that set of boxes a few months, maybe after the first frost<br/>
before visiting.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; On a lighter note, I replaced two store bought stamps with 2 nicely<br/>
hand carved ones.<br/>
&gt; If you haven't found Golden Oak or Red Maple, check them out.<br/>

&gt; Be careful out there.<br/>

&gt; &gt; Actually, we did a damn good job on that hike. With half the<br/>
forest literally <br/>
&gt; &gt; torn down due to hurricanes (and of course all of the torn down<br/>
trees were the <br/>
&gt; &gt; ones with the blazes), it's a miracle we found our way out. We<br/>
will definately <br/>
&gt; &gt; conquer it in the fall....I am still proud of our effort. That's<br/>
all part fo <br/>
&gt; &gt; safe boxing, know when you are in over your head, know when it's<br/>
time to turn <br/>
&gt; &gt; back, and listen to your common sense when it is screaming "Is it<br/>
really worth <br/>
&gt; &gt; getting lost/injured/dead over a piece of rubber in a piece of<br/>
plastic?" Know <br/>
&gt; &gt; when to call it a day and come back later better prepared. We done<br/>

&gt; &gt; LOL, don't worry, I'm not harrassing anything that looks like that. <br/>
&gt; &gt; I'm not sure I even want to poke a stick anywhere near these big <br/>
&gt; &gt; fellas. <br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; I just want to avoid the area at all possible costs. I have healthy <br/>
&gt; &gt; respect for snakes, but I just choose not to be in the same vicinity <br/>
&gt; &gt; if I can anyway help it. Must be Freudian, huh? ;o) <br/>

&gt; &gt; The snakes were actually the animal embodiment of shy letterboxers. <br/>
&gt; &gt; They were afraid that you would want to make an exchange! ;-) <br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; We've got some timber rattlers here in PA as well, but most of the <br/>
&gt; &gt; rascals I have encountered are smaller than those impressive bad <br/>
&gt; &gt; boys. The one I nearly ran over on my mtn bike some years ago was <br/>
&gt; &gt; only about 2" long. Still, we gave it much respect. <br/>

Jan - No need to feel guilty.  Yellow Jackets can build their <br/>
underground nests pretty darn quickly.  Last year, there was a nest <br/>
by the Chapman Park box #1 (Who's the Author) within a couple weeks <br/>
of it being planted.  I got nailed there.<br/>

&gt; &gt; Hi all,<br/>
&gt; &gt; Didn't see no snakes this weekend, but we have a major warning for<br/>
&gt; Green Lane boxers.<br/>
&gt; &gt; We were hunting for Team Little Dog's "My Dream, My Reality" on<br/>
&gt; Saturday.<br/>
&gt; &gt; I was with another dad, one of my girls and 2 of his kids.<br/>
&gt; &gt; We got to the expected spot behind a big dead tree.  We were<br/>
&gt; surprised to see a copy of the clus sheet laying right there.  Then<br/>
&gt; the other dad starting yelping and hopping around.  Followed closely<br/>
&gt; by his daughter, then mine.<br/>
&gt; &gt; We were standing right on top of a yellow jacket nest.<br/>
&gt; &gt; I have never been pursued like that in my life.  They clung to our<br/>
&gt; clothes for 100s of yards.<br/>
&gt; &gt; I kept swiping at my shorts, my boots, my daughter.  One went up <br/>
her<br/>
&gt; shirt, one in her bangs.  She got it worst, I think 10 stings.  I <br/>
only<br/>
&gt; got one.<br/>
&gt; &gt; Very scary.  Luckily no one was allergic.<br/>
&gt; &gt; I'd give that set of boxes a few months, maybe after the first <br/>
frost<br/>
&gt; before visiting.<br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; On a lighter note, I replaced two store bought stamps with 2 <br/>
nicely<br/>
&gt; hand carved ones.<br/>

&gt; &gt; &gt; in summer) and I wouldn't want anyone to go and harass them,<br/>
&gt; however, they <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; are in the Catoctins in Maryland (and not near any letterboxes<br/>
&gt; that I know <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; of). <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; Yesterday's hike was not a boxing hike, however, it is just a<br/>
&gt; reminder <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; about snakes being around at this time of year - so poke with a<br/>
&gt; stick for <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; boxes before you reach your hands in! :-) Of course, as soon as <br/>
my<br/>
&gt; husband <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; started talking yesterday, all the snakes hurried to slither <br/>
away,<br/>

&gt; &gt; &gt; Actually, we did a damn good job on that hike. With half the<br/>
&gt; forest literally <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; torn down due to hurricanes (and of course all of the torn down<br/>
&gt; trees were the <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; ones with the blazes), it's a miracle we found our way out. We<br/>
&gt; will definately <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; conquer it in the fall....I am still proud of our effort. That's<br/>
&gt; all part fo <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; safe boxing, know when you are in over your head, know when it's<br/>
&gt; time to turn <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; back, and listen to your common sense when it is screaming "Is <br/>
it<br/>
&gt; really worth <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; getting lost/injured/dead over a piece of rubber in a piece of<br/>
&gt; plastic?" Know <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; when to call it a day and come back later better prepared. We <br/>

&gt; &gt; &gt; The snakes were actually the animal embodiment of shy <br/>
letterboxers. <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; They were afraid that you would want to make an exchange! ;-) <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; We've got some timber rattlers here in PA as well, but most of <br/>
the <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; rascals I have encountered are smaller than those impressive <br/>
bad <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; boys. The one I nearly ran over on my mtn bike some years ago <br/>
was <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; only about 2" long. Still, we gave it much respect. <br/>

&gt; &gt; &gt; I agree with the Pink Hatters! I've put personal safety atop <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; getting a stamp on several occaisions, the 2nd most recent <br/>
being Dr. <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; Who #9, which may have been in a place that would surely <br/>
dislocate <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; my left shoulder again! Also, Tom and I recently decided to not <br/>
go <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; after some other hikeable boxes after our most recent Hairy <br/>

&gt; &gt; &gt; the torn down trees were the ones with the blazes), it's a <br/>

&gt; &gt; &gt; we found our way out. We will definately conquer it in the <br/>

&gt; Didn't see no snakes this weekend, but we have a major warning for <br/>
&gt; Green Lane boxers.<br/>
&gt; We were hunting for Team Little Dog's "My Dream, My Reality" on Saturday.<br/>
&gt; I was with another dad, one of my girls and 2 of his kids.<br/>
&gt; We got to the expected spot behind a big dead tree.  We were surprised <br/>
&gt; to see a copy of the clus sheet laying right there.  Then the other <br/>
&gt; dad starting yelping and hopping around.  Followed closely by his <br/>
&gt; daughter, then mine.<br/>
&gt; We were standing right on top of a yellow jacket nest.<br/>
&gt; I have never been pursued like that in my life.  They clung to our <br/>
&gt; clothes for 100s of yards.<br/>
&gt; I kept swiping at my shorts, my boots, my daughter.  One went up her <br/>
&gt; shirt, one in her bangs.  She got it worst, I think 10 stings.  I only <br/>
&gt; got one.<br/>
&gt; Very scary.  Luckily no one was allergic.<br/>
&gt; I'd give that set of boxes a few months, maybe after the first frost <br/>
&gt; before visiting.<br/>
&gt;  <br/>
&gt; On a lighter note, I replaced two store bought stamps with 2 nicely <br/>
&gt; hand carved ones.<br/>
&gt; If you haven't found Golden Oak or Red Maple, check them out.<br/>
&gt;  <br/>
&gt; Be careful out there.<br/>
