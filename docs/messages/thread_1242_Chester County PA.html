very interested in LB and his admin has contacted the parks head <br/>
(County Parks have already been giving approvals) and also the <br/>
Facilities head (in charge of some county roads - we're planning a <br/>
special series to be placed at various scenic country spots around <br/>
the county on county property).  I will be contacting both of them <br/>
next week by phone.<br/>

Facilities director are working on an "official" County Policy <br/>
statement to permit letterboxing and geocaching - up to this point <br/>
there had been an informal agreement and a form that needed to be <br/>
filled out, but they wanted to formalize the policy and extend it to <br/>
all county properties.  They are very interested in it and have <br/>
actually asked me to provide feedback to them when they send me the <br/>
draft.  I am truly excited and glad that I took the approach of <br/>
getting permission before placing a box.  I'll keep you updated.<br/>
