<div>Jan,</div>
<div>Please don't feel responsible for this.</div>
<div>It's one of the hazards of the sport.</div>
<div>I doubt the nest was there when you planted.</div>
<div>I've gone back to find some of my boxes completely surrounded by poison ivy, something I would never do if the season was different.</div>
<div>As it turns out, we were harassed by yellow jackets all weekend back at our campsite.</div>
<div>This time of year they are just nuts.</div>
<div>Everyone is fine now.</div>
<div>Happy Trails everyone.</div>

<div>Tim - I hope that you and your family are OK.  Yellow jackets are <br/>nasty aggressive little wasps that will hound you even after you <br/>flee.  10 stings is pretty severe.<br/><br/>Jan - No need to feel guilty.  Yellow Jackets can build their <br/>underground nests pretty darn quickly.  Last year, there was a nest <br/>by the Chapman Park box #1 (Who's the Author) within a couple weeks <br/>of it being planted.  I got nailed there.<br/><br/>LB<br/><br/></div></html></div>
