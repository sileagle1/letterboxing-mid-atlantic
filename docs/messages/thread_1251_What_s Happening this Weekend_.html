<br/>
Just wanted to know what your boxious plans are this weekend.<br/>
<br/>
I will be meeting up with Team J+R from Maryland on Sunday Morning to <br/>
conquer Tyler and get musical.  We will begin boxing at 8:30 am at the <br/>
Boat House Parking Area.  As we will be going for many boxes over a <br/>
long day, Kirby Rider will probably be resting up at home, awaiting <br/>
the stamp images.<br/>
<br/>
We will be tired at the end of the day, as one would expect!<br/>

the Columbia River Gorge and Mt. Hood areas.<br/>

<div>That's what I thought too--the "right" place per my compass was not at all where it turned out to be.  But I'd chalked it up to me being sloppy with the compass as usual.  I just kept looking for logs....</div>

Though hungry, my traveling companion had to hightail it home so we <br/>
