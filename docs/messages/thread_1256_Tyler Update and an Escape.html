wanted to give an update as I gear up for the Knoebels Gathering on <br/>
September 24.<br/>
<br/>
I have reserved two campsites (cabins were scarce) with platforms for <br/>
those interested in camping.  I know Sheba, Judy and Irene are <br/>
4nterested.  For those looking to split the cost of a site, please email <br/>
me privately and I will put you on the list.<br/>

For those looking for some late nite fun after the gathering, feel free <br/>
to stop by sites H-2 and H-4.  You can find them on the campground map here:<br/>

&gt; On Sunday, Team J+R and I explored part of what Tyler SP in PA has <br/>
to <br/>

&gt; The Hop Devil<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Excellent boxes, one and all and many thanks to Irene for arranging <br/>
&gt; all.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; After that, we agreed that we were 'all boxed out' and decided to <br/>
&gt; head to a couple nearby wineries.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; We deferred the following boxes to another day, when it is not as <br/>
&gt; muddy or perhaps the vegetation is not as dense.<br/>
