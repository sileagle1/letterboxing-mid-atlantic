<div><font size="2">Sprite and Highlander did a fantastic job on the WNY Gathering. A fine time was had by all! And the location was a great park full of old forest land along Lake Ontario. Really gorgeous. The weather was perfect and the boxing was grand! &lt;g&gt; I'll have some pictures up later this week if anyone wants to see them.</font></div>
