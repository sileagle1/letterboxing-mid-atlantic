<div>After driving practically to Canada and back for the Western NY thing, I'm staying home this weekend. I love NYC on Labor Day weekend. So many people are out of town that the streets are actually actually less crowded. It's nice. Today I found four boxes, a HH *and* met true indigo and family on the "trails" of Gotham!! She was checking on her Flatiron Building box that I was FINALLY getting around to doing. </div>
<div> </div>
<div>I'm sitting there and I see three people walk by. The woman looks down at the location, and I'm like, there is NO reason for anyone to look down there like that except a letterboxer. I sat there and eventually they came back. We did that kind of questioning, hesitating thing and before we knew it, we just KNEW and were hugging hello! That was sooooo funny! And they didn't have their stamps with them!!  Argh! We'll have to do the exchange at the Knoebels.  Very cool day, boxes, a HH &amp; meeting on the trail!!</div>

                    <div id="ygrps-yiv-454166011">We were took Ravenboy back to Gotham after visiting with us for a week. I had a travel bug <br/>
that Janila of Team Little Dog had handed off to me that also needed to go to the city. I <br/>
knew of a geocache in the same park as my Flat Iron building letterbox and was going to <br/>
drop it off.<br/>
<br/>
We walked by to check on the box but there was a woman sitting there. We went to the <br/>
end of the park where the geocache is and it was all crowded and blocked with a large <br/>
screen tv for folks to watch the US Open. Ravenboy tried to sneak in to get to it but there <br/>
was just no getting there without being seen by hundreds of tv viewers.<br/>
<br/>
Grumpy about trying to figure out what to do with the travel bug, we decided to walk back <br/>
to the letterbox again. This time some guy in a ball cap opening packages of Rogaine was <br/>
sitting there but it looked like he would leave soon so we sat down near him. He finally <br/>
read all the instructions, packed it up, and walked away as we realized we were at the <br/>
wrong spot! With an added amount of grumpy, we walked down to where the same woman <br/>
was still there but we saw her getting up. I encouraged RGBisMe to rush ahead and save <br/>
the spot before someone else took it but then noticed she was reaching right where the <br/>
letterbox should be.<br/>
<br/>
"She's a BOXER!" we all smiled. It's our first time meeting someone out on the trail for and <br/>
we didn't have our stuff for exchanges. It was terrific to finally meet Miss Moon after <br/>
months of enjoying so many of her local letterboxes. We exchanged hugs and hope to <br/>
meet up at Knoebels for officially exchanging stamps. That was the highlight of our <br/>
weekend.<br/>
<br/>
We also tried to find Camp Grandma at Prince Gallitzin State Park and found a likely hiding <br/>
place but no box. About 10 miles closer to Altoona we then bushwhacked to a nearby <br/>
geocache where someone decided to start shooting their hand gun in our direction for <br/>
target practice. With the new knowledge of what a bullets sound like buzzing through <br/>
leaves over my head I am resolved to never hike in the woods anytime near hunting <br/>
season, blaze orange on my back or not. That was just too frightening.<br/>

cleaning up of the 'letterbox blob' and prepared 3 new boxes to <br/>
stash - 2 for a Girl Scout Leader training course (in letterboxing, <br/>
natch - 17 Sept near Quakertown) that Jan and Cyclonic are helping me <br/>
out with and one that will be a mystery.<br/>
<br/>
We did try our hand at Orienteering on Sunday.  What a blast!  If <br/>
anybodyis looking for a fun alternative (not extreme) to LB, give <br/>
this a whirl.  We'll be back again doing it this Saturday, as it <br/>
helps Kirby Rider earn a scouting merit badge and is much fun.  The <br/>
Philly area group is at www.dvoa.org  .<br/>
<br/>
Also started considering how to package up the "world's biggest <br/>
letterbox" for Knoebels.  Will need some really big SPOR!<br/>
<br/>
Hope everybody's weekend was as good as ours.<br/>
