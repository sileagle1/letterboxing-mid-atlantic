serious business here.<br/>
<br/>
This is a call for HELP from all Residents of the Northern Virginia <br/>
Regional Park Authority's six member jurisdictions:<br/>
Cities of Alexandria, Fairfax and Fall Church<br/>
Counties of Arlington, Fairfax and Loudoun<br/>
and anyone Camping at Pohick Bay Regional Park<br/>
<br/>
There will be lots of boxes planted both in the gather park and at <br/>
other parks in the vicinity.  One such park is Pohick Bay Regional <br/>
Park - with a $7/vehicle/day entrance fee!!!  EXCEPT, for those <br/>
residents listed above and those Camping at Pohick.<br/>
<br/>
I hope to establish a Shuttle Service from the gather to Pohick to <br/>
both deliver and retrieve boxers to the gather.  <br/>
<br/>
This is a 45 min donation of your time and tagged vehicle.  A map for <br/>
Pohick is available at:   <a href="http://www.nvrpa.org/pohickmap.html" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.nvrpa.org/pohickmap.html</a><br/>
<br/>
There are six parking lots which are near boxious trail heads - only <br/>
five will be used because the boat shore launch lot usually has an <br/>
attendant collecting more fees!  <br/>
<br/>
To collect the names of those willing to drive I have added a <br/>
DATABASE to the LBMA List (Mystery - Shuttle Schedule).  Please enter <br/>
your email, trailname, number of riders you can carry, and vehicle <br/>
make/model.  <br/>
<br/>
It would be helpful if there were two volunteers per time slot - so I <br/>
have records 1-10 for the 8:30 to 3:15 slots and records 11-20 Repeat <br/>
the Time Slots for backup drivers.  Each Driver MUST complete the <br/>
full 45 min round trip route from gather pavillion to Pohick Bay <br/>
parking lots AND RETURN to pavillion.  <br/>
<br/>
At the gather there will be a sign-up board for Riders - based upon <br/>
volunteers and size of vehicles.  <br/>
<br/>
Obviously I need all INPUT BY Noon on Fri Sept 16 so I can make the <br/>
Rider Board.<br/>
