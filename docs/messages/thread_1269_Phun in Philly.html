We tackled the rest (we think) of the Pennypack Pack Boxes on Friday, <br/>
and managed to find:<br/>
<br/>
Ben Franklin: Inventor, Scientist &amp; Founder Boxes<br/>
Mint Eagle<br/>
Pennypack Park Box<br/>
<br/>
And no less than three (!!!) hitchhikers.  We also dropped off one of <br/>
our newly-minted trash hitchhikers (On Your Mark, Get Set, Recycle) <br/>
at a place that really needed the help.  This one was carved and <br/>
assembled by b#1, who is 9, so the stamp image requires a little <br/>
creative interpretation.  Hopefully it still qualifies as art.  We <br/>
had replaced the outer bag of this box so we used the old holey one <br/>
to clean up a particularly egregious mess on the way back out (we all <br/>
smelled like beer, YUCK) but there is still plenty there for the next <br/>
person who finds the box.<br/>
<br/>
We also hunted unsuccessfully for the final Ben Franklin box, but I <br/>
am not sure we were in the correct spot.<br/>
<br/>
Another beautiful day on Sat so we went down to Smithville NJ and <br/>
worked on Bicycle Rail Road.  The first stamp (turtle turtle) appears <br/>
to be missing, as many noted in the log book for the second stamp.  <br/>
We also went to one other mystery location and managed to get some <br/>
hitchhikers moving again.<br/>
<br/>
Not sure if we will get to box the rest of this weekend but we are <br/>
definitely going out next week before school starts.  Hope everyone <br/>
else is having a great boxing weekend aided by this beautiful weather!<br/>
