<br/>
I've got a question for you.  How many of you would be willing to <br/>
share the general area in which you live?<br/>
<br/>
Personally, I live in the Lehigh Valley area of Eastern PA <br/>
(Allentown/Bethlehem/Easton).<br/>
<br/>
I realize this may have been asked before, but I am curious where we <br/>
are, etc.  Individual towns are not necessary, just a general <br/>
question.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks,<br/>

traffic circle any more. It has been removed and replaced by a <br/>
classic intersection with traffic lights. Hmmm, pull over, check the <br/>
map, scratch your head, swear that you must be in the wrong place, <br/>
continue driving and get really lost because the road signs and the <br/>
streets named on the map don't always match! Also, many, but not all <br/>
left and U turns are made via a loop or 'jughandle' on the far right <br/>
side of the road. You'll usually figure this out when you're <br/>
approaching the traffic light and there's no hope of getting across 3 <br/>
lanes of traffic to make your turn. Bet money on the fact that if <br/>
you're in the right lane, there will be a left turn arrow.<br/>
<br/>
A.M., I quickly read your post the other day and checked it again <br/>
before responding. I didn't realize that you were Hello Kitty too. I <br/>
found your Paint Works box. I see that you've adopted a few boxes and <br/>
that Seashore has taken over the ones further south. There is curious <br/>
information on the Susquehanna clue page. The second line under the <br/>
title, the Placement date reads Dec. 31 1969???  I went out to find <br/>
Twice The Trouble the other day. A real comedy of errors involving <br/>
other hikers, swarms of bugs and intense heat and exhausted water <br/>
supply. I left without finding the box. I think that I was lucky to <br/>
make it out of the park. I shall return, however.<br/>

The Jersey 'jughandle' and traffic circles aren't a big help <br/>either.                                                        <br/>Warning to people from out of state : not all places called circle, <br/>like Airport Circle or shown on a map, like Medford Circle have a <br/>traffic circle any more. It has been removed and replaced by a <br/>classic intersection with traffic lights. Hmmm, pull over,
 check the <br/>map, scratch your head, swear that you must be in the wrong place, <br/>continue driving and get really lost because the road signs and the <br/>streets named on the map don't always match! Also, many, but not all <br/>left and U turns are made via a loop or 'jughandle' on the far right <br/>side of the road. You'll usually figure this out when you're <br/>approaching the traffic light and there's no hope of getting across 3 <br/>lanes of traffic to make your turn. Bet money on the fact that if <br/>you're in the right lane, there will be a left turn arrow.<br/><br/>A.M., I quickly read your post the other day and checked it again <br/>before responding. I didn't realize that you were Hello Kitty too. I <br/>found your Paint Works box. I see that you've adopted a few boxes and <br/>that Seashore has taken over the ones further south. There is curious <br/>information on the Susquehanna clue page. The second line under the <br/>title, the Placement date reads Dec. 31 1969???  I
 went out to find <br/>Twice The Trouble the other day. A real comedy of errors involving <br/>other hikers, swarms of bugs and intense heat and exhausted water <br/>supply. I left without finding the box. I think that I was lucky to <br/>make it out of the park. I shall return, however.<br/><br/>Gillian              <br/><br/><br/><br/>  In lbma@yahoogroups.com, "A.

<br/>
If you plan on traveling in NJ, and are accustomed to<br/>
getting your directions via Mapquest...be very<br/>
cautious.  Mapquest does NOT know how to describe a<br/>
jughandle.  Be wary of any instruction to "fork right<br/>
and go 0.05 miles" or anything like that.  Make sure<br/>
you check the Mapquest route against a decent map<br/>
before attempting an unfamiliar route.  I've lived<br/>
here since I was 3, and I've been burned by trusting<br/>
Mapquest too many times to count.  ;)<br/>

"More Than Just a Turnpike" Is there a science based sister program <br/>
entitled "More Than Just a Superfund Site"? I had heard such terrible <br/>
things about NJ before I moved here that I actually did check. I <br/>
learned something interesting. Contaminated sites not actively being <br/>
cleaned and not yet funded are not called Superfund Sites. There's a <br/>
different list for those. Oh my, I wonder if I missed any lists?  :-o</div>
