<br/>
That was my thought. Sometimes things don't really make sense till <br/>
you reach the location. I've been to the Outer Banks but never that <br/>
far down. I'd love to go and look for that box! but in addition to <br/>
being busy for the next few days, the approval on the bank loan for <br/>
the gas money hasn't come through yet.<br/>

I have been using and contributing to <a href="http://www.gasbuddy.com" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.gasbuddy.com</a>  and http://<br/>
www.gaspricewatch.com/new .  They track local gas prices based on the reports of <br/>
volunteers on the service.  You can enter your location and they will give you the current <br/>
prices at nearby gas stations.<br/>
<br/>
As H&amp;H pointed out, high gas prices are a national problem, but gouging is a local one.  If <br/>
enough people participate in these services, it has the potential to help create a small local <br/>
price competition and keep gouging down in your area - particularly if you let the local <br/>
station managers know what you're doing.<br/>
<br/>
It doesn't help much once you are on the road, but with the growth of wi-fi networks, it <br/>
will.<br/>
<br/>
And if the loan does come through, I have a nice little treasure trail started from one end <br/>
of the Outer Banks to the other along Route 12.  Between our boxes and the wonderful <br/>
contributions of others, there are 16 boxes along a beautiful 100 mile drive.<br/>
