<br/>
Tues. we went to Tyler Park PA with our good friends Team Deloro.  We <br/>
started at the Aerosmith box from the Craftsmen Guild lot but quickly <br/>
ran into trouble with the Bee Gees, so we moved to the Plantation <br/>
Grove lot and after a fortifying picnic lunch, found:<br/>
<br/>
Grateful Dead (what a hill!)<br/>
Frank Zappa<br/>
String Cheese Incident<br/>
Elvis Series: Hound Dog, Blue Suede Shoes and TCB<br/>
plus the Fighting Owls HH<br/>
<br/>
We were unable to find Nine Inch Nails box.  :o(<br/>
<br/>
Wed. found us launching an all-out assault on Manhattan, with the <br/>
help of a couple of family members (inc. one savvy NYC resident).  In <br/>
the following order:<br/>
<br/>
Metropolitan Museum of Art<br/>
New York, New York (could not find)<br/>
Give My Regards to Broadway<br/>
Irish Diaspora (also not to be found, but cool spot)<br/>
Italian for Beginners<br/>
Little Apple in the Big Apple<br/>
<br/>
Plus a new box planted, clues to be posted soon. We stamped the town <br/>
purple!  And I am sore beyond belief.  Half of our team went back to <br/>
school today, so thank goodness I get a little break.  They didn't <br/>
make their goal of 100 boxes this summer but they came pretty close <br/>
(80+) and agreed that they had a great time trying.<br/>
<br/>
Hope everyone has a good boxing weekend.  Weather is supposed to be <br/>
gorgeous.<br/>
