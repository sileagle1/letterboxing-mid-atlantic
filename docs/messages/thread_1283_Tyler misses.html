Gees posed more of a problem.  We were pretty sure we were at the <br/>
right tree but the thorns were such that we could not get anywhere <br/>
near the trunk.  We decided to come back and try that part of the <br/>
park later in the fall.<br/>
<br/>
Good luck with the Civil War Century!  Sounds like a really neat ride.<br/>
