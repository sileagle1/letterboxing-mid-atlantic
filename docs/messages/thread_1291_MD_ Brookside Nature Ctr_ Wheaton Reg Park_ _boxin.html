naturalist. She introduced 4 families with young children to <br/>
letterboxing. Handouts included copies of the Smithsonian article, the <br/>
2002 Washington Post article and clues to nearby letterboxes. The kids <br/>
made "stamps" with foam cutouts and decorated little logbooks. I was <br/>
asked to share my logbook and answer questions. Then they all went out <br/>
to find the one remaining letterbox in the park. <br/>
<br/>
Lynette and the on-duty ranger were very enthusiastic about the hobby <br/>
and encouraged the placement of more letterboxes in the park, no <br/>
advance permission required. Yay!<br/>
