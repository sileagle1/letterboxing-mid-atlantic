                    <div id="ygrps-yiv-2089218815">Wow! Thats what, 4 or 5 of us now? Well partner, this state's getting <br/>
too small for letterboxers. Actually, I have 1 more stop and grab in <br/>
the area, a 20-30 minute drive and a mile(?) walk for 2 boxes. After <br/>
that the drive(usually) or the walk gets longer. I'm not complaining, <br/>
but it means that I have to have more time, 4 or more hours to pick <br/>
up a box or 2.<br/>
<br/>
Here's an idea : I'll put out a group of letterboxes with really <br/>
cheap on sale stamps (like Halloween and Christmas) in dollar store <br/>
plasticware and 'plant' them in places like shopping mall bathrooms. <br/>
<br/>
There's a history there. When I lived in NC my husband went on alot <br/>
of business trips. At a trade show, he had bought a 5 inch long solid <br/>
plastic cylindrical key chain for me (personal defense item). Airport <br/>
security would never allow me to go to a gate with this in my <br/>
possesion. Before seeing him off, I would go into the ladies room and <br/>
put it on a ledge over the mirror and retrieve it later. I'd probably <br/>
be arrested for commiting a terrotistic act now.<br/>
<br/>
It will take quite some time to reach 100 finds.</div>
