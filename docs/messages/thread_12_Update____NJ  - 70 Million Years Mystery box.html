                    <div id="ygrps-yiv-1932428988">Hi all,<br/>
<br/>
Just to let you all know, I have adopted this box and I am proud to <br/>
report it is alive and well.  I have replaced the tupperware box and <br/>
put everything in baggies.  The log book was not completely filled so <br/>
I did not replace it yet.  The stamp was in fine shape.  <br/>
<br/>
We were planning on checking my other adopted box:<br/>
<br/>
      NJ      "O Be My Friend"<br/>
<br/>
but our plans did not work out that way this weekend  :(    <br/>
<br/>
My husband is having surgery tomorrow so I wont be able to check on <br/>
this box til the weekend.  He should be up and about by then.  <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
