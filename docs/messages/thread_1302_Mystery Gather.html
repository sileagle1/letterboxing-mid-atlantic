on <br/>
the trail until the very last bit of daylight was gone??  It was 8pm <br/>
and pitch black outside as we were coming off the Marsh Trail. I<br/>
could <br/>
hardly see where I was going and I got a little freaked out thinking<br/>
we <br/>
were going to get lost (or better yet, eaten by something) and then I <br/>
started hearing the Psycho music in my head!! And to top it off, we<br/>
had <br/>
a great time in the process! <br/>
A HUGE thank you to Gallant Rogue, The Doubtful Guests, Knights of <br/>
Columbo and Sewsowbizzy for hosting a wonderful event! <br/>

If you printed them - go back and check Dogue Creek Detectives and Meadowood.  Two<br/>
changes made on those!<br/>
