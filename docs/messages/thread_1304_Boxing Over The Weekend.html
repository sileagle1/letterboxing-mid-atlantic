<div>Hiya Sheba...</div>

<div>Actually, I'm not entirely new to this list; I had been on it under another 
name, but then I thought of a cool new trail name and created an ID around it 
and then subscribed.  Under my old ID I rarely posted, but with an 
exclusive ID I can be more active.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>I found the three boxes in the Northwest Branch Trail series, in Silver 
Spring, MD, and the "Suitable for Quiet Contemplation" box which I had tried to 
find once before but couldn't.  I found the "Dino" hitchhiker which seems 
new, I'm the first person to stamp in.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>BTW, the name "Vagrarian" comes from the writings of crackpot occultist 
Elliot O'Donnell, who used the term "vagrarian" to refer to a sort of wandering 
nature spirit.  I like that idea.  Also, it almost sounds like a 
cross-breeding of "vagrant" and "librarian" and I'm a major book fiend so that's 
appropriate, plus I read over a huge variety of topics.  So it's a fun 
name.  :)</div>
