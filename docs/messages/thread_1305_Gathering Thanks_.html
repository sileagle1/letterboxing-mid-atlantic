                    <div id="ygrps-yiv-2018916465"><div>Warcat 76 just walked in the door from the fabulous weekend.  Just wanted to thank all the ace detectives for putting together such a fabulous gathering.  Everything was so well planned out- the theme, the planting, the mini event on Fri., the prizes, the food and so much more .So much fun.  We managed to find a total of 40 stamps (including a few non-gather stamps)!  The idea of having to find the 3 map stamps to get the location of the gathering was unique (and a scarey thought to us at first) and we managed to find them without getting lost!  </div>
<div> </div>
<div>I would recommend that anyone who could not attend the gathering try to make a trip to the area while the boxes are still out there.  There is some fine carving hidden on those trails!</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Again, thanks to our hosts for a great time!</div>
