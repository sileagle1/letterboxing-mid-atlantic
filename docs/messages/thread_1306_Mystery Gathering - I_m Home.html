tough though! <br/>

Thanks to all, and I'll post tomorrow with more thorough comments! I <br/>
have to get some sleep!<br/>

rough on the turns though...<br/>

Thank you so much for your's and Janet's hospitality. The wekend <br/>
would have been much less fun if I had had to pitch that tent in the <br/>
rain. You guys made our weekend! (even Sadie gave us a few laughs, <br/>
probably me more than Andrew though, hehe...) If ever you venture <br/>
down this way, I hope you will let us return the favors!<br/>
<br/>
Thanks also for all your hard work on the gathering. The burgers <br/>
were great, the stamps were stunning (except for that one that <br/>
didn't taste so good), the maps were highly appreciated, and the <br/>
company was wonderful. This gathering well exceeded my expectations!<br/>
<br/>
Hope you are feeling better sooner than later! <br/>
<br/>
Take care,<br/>
<br/>
Liz<br/>
