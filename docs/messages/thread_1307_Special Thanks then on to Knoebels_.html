Thanks to the organizers, carvers <u>and</u> attendees, after all, it's not a gathering if no one shows up! Dude and I will be heading back down the first or second weekend in October to get the stamps that we didn't get to.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>A special thanks to Sowsewbizzy. Most friends will invite you to stay at their home when you're visiting from out of town, it's truly a rare friend who will let you bring your dog! Dude and I thank you very, very much.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Gallant Rogue, Dude apologizes profusely for the er...cooler incident. He doesn't know what came over him.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Now, Cyclonic has been planting and carving his brains out so everybody up to PA this weekend for a wonderful gathering in one of my favorite places on the planet, Knoebels Groves!</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Hope to see you all there,</div>

You should receive it by wednesday. (You wanted with beans right?)<br/>
Dude is welcome back. If we had a little more time to introduce them <br/>
