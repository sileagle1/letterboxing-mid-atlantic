Team A.D.D. (also from WV) couldn't make it at the last minute.<br/>
<br/>
Anyhoo, Great Time!<br/>
<br/>
I was quite sore and with blistered when I got home. (Whoever planned <br/>
my day to include a 10 hour forced march should be fired!)<br/>
<br/>
Night boxing at 5:30 a.m. was quite an experience! Thanks Shell for <br/>
meeting me so early (and actually pointing out where the trail was!) <br/>
I saw a couple pairs of glowing eyes, heard some rustling noises - <br/>
and I walked through MOST of the cobwebs stretched across the path. <br/>
(Clearing the way for boxers to come.) The moon was quite large and <br/>
low in the morning sky when I started, and the sun was a glorious <br/>
orange ball nestled on the horizon during the last stretch of my <br/>
drive home.<br/>
<br/>
I wish I hadn't been so obsessed, because I sat at the pavilion for <br/>
only a little bit at lunch (I had the Spam, thank you) and most folks <br/>
had cleared out by 5 when I got back, so I didn't get to chat much <br/>
with anyone.<br/>
<br/>
Dead Duck Chuck and Tempus Fugit, next time we REALLY need beer - AND <br/>
it's on me in gratitude for the help with that one particular stamp. <br/>
(We did go back and get it.)<br/>
<br/>
I'm not sure WHO the couple was ahead of us on the Kane's Creek <br/>
Mystery - BUT THANK YOU! (We'd catch up on them every now and then <br/>
and they'd send us back in the other direction, because we just <br/>
walked past the box.)<br/>
<br/>
The Beads, the boxes, the people, the prizes, the clues, the <br/>
fun...thank you all for organizing this event.<br/>
<br/>
Now, someone please just organize an event in a bar that requires <br/>
sitting.<br/>
<br/>
Or is that my job?</div>
