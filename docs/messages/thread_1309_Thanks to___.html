much fun and felt involved and special! You really catered to <br/>
everyone's interests. The variety of trails, the unique clues, all <br/>
the amazing stamps, and the list just goes on... You really outdid <br/>
yourself and we thank you!<br/>
<br/>
Sewsowbizzy - Even though we never made it out there, thanks for <br/>
helping with camping. And thanks for the offers of hospitality. You <br/>
are truely a jem of the letterboxing community. You were there for <br/>
everything, we had a great time boxing with you. You're since of <br/>
humor was very refreshing! It's great to walk into a weekend with a <br/>
bunch of strangers and walk away with a few good friends. Thank you!<br/>
<br/>
Gallant Rogue - You were instrumental in the sucess of our weekend! <br/>
Thank you!<br/>
<br/>
Scarab - Another delightful edition of clue, this time without all <br/>
the confussion. Thank you for you efforts in organizing that again! <br/>
As I look through my logbook, I am still in awe of your beautiful <br/>
carvings. We especially loved the Coffin at Meadowood and the bones <br/>
we found with it. Great fun! Glad to have found you on Sunday. Great <br/>
lunch and we appreciate the advice. Always a real pleasure to see <br/>
you. Thank you!<br/>
<br/>
Schizokeet - From the bottom of my heart, thank you for being so <br/>
great with Andrew. He never felt left out when he was with you. I <br/>
enjoyed boxing with you. I ever you want to come down this way, <br/>
don't hesitate to let me know! You and Disc-Lava are welcome <br/>
anytime. Thank you!<br/>
<br/>
Hikers and Hounds - Always great to see you. Wish we had the time to <br/>
slow down and smell the roses. Thanks for helping out with Andrew. <br/>
Very few people would have been so kind! Dude was quite the <br/>
comedian! Never a boring moment! You should consider buying him his <br/>
own cooler though for next time! LOL But seriously, thank you!<br/>
<br/>
To all the people that carved works of art and sent them in, we <br/>
thank you. We had the most fun stamping in and finding all those <br/>
boxes!<br/>
<br/>
We will be looking forward to the next gathering up there. It will <br/>
be hard for all of you to top this showing though!<br/>
