any time thanking everyone involved for such a great event.  This was <br/>
our first letterboxing gathering, and it was well worth the trip down <br/>
from Massachusetts.  We had a great time.  Even getting soaked in the <br/>
rain that came just as we reached the farthest point out on the Wood <br/>
Marsh Trail didn't dampen our spirits.  It did absolutely DRENCH the <br/>
rest of our parts and pieces, though!<br/>
<br/>
Again, many thanks to Gallant Rogue, The Doubtful Guests, Knights of<br/>
Columbo, and Sewsowbizzy for hosting a wonderful event!<br/>
