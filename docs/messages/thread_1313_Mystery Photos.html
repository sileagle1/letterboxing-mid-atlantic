<br/>
But it sure was tedious uploading one at a time - even with DSL.  <br/>
Maybe I shouldn't have uploaded all 136.<br/>

                    <div id="ygrps-yiv-229049465">OK, I must have jammed the PHOTOS section yesterday.  The Quiet One <br/>
unblocked it and I tried uploading more photos into 2005 MYSTERY.<br/>
<br/>
I tried to reduce their size, and ended up loading files 4x as big!?!  <br/>
So I deleted my efforts from today. They are on AQ<br/>
<br/>
What am I doing wrong?  TELL ME OFF LIST  sowbiz @ yahoo . com<br/>
<br/>
Here is what I did do:<br/>
OPEN my FILE IMAGE, right click - EDIT, then IMAGE - REDUCE/RESIZE.  <br/>
Went for 50% horiz &amp; vert.  Then saved again as "old name - 50%" so I <br/>
wouldn't mess up my original.  So now when I upload the 50% version <br/>
they came up 100+KB vs previously at 25+KB.  Yahoo isn't doing their <br/>
reduction thing.<br/>
