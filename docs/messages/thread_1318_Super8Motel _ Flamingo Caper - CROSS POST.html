I know of) who are rooming at the Super 8 Motel, 482 N Main St,<br/>
Leominster MA. 978.537.2800<br/>
<br/>
So far:<br/>
Knights of Columbo (VA)<br/>
sewsowbizzy (VA)<br/>
phinstarr (NY)<br/>
<br/>
We are planning to rally in the lobby at 9PM Fri for a Super8 pre-<br/>
mini-gathering, complete with event stamp.<br/>
<br/>
If anyone is arriving earlier let me know (sowbiz @ yahoo . com) so<br/>
we can maybe dine together.<br/>
<br/>
Knights of Columbo and sewsowbizzy will be flying into Boston around<br/>
noon and driving to Leominster - boxing enroute. Can't say exactly<br/>
when we will arrive -- just how many boxes are there between Boston<br/>
and Leominster?<br/>
<br/>
See all y'all there then<br/>
