us... to talk about letterboxing.  Turns out that he had given her <br/>
(and the rest of the class, who she said were a little bewildered by <br/>
it all) an entire presentation on the ins and outs of the hobby.  She <br/>
checked with all her friends, who had never heard of it, but when she <br/>
went to the website (address supplied by said b#2) she was amazed to <br/>
see it all there, just as he described.  He even brought in photos of <br/>
himself letterboxing for his "what I did over the summer" poster.<br/>

Wow, the power of a young convert.<br/>

p.s. We *really* wish we could be at Knoebel's this weekend.  Work and <br/>
other commitments got in the way, but we hope to meet you all sometime <br/>
soon.  Can't wait to hear about the event stamp, given Cyclonic's <br/>
talent in that arena.  Hope everyone has a great time!</div>
