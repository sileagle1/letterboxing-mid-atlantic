atmosphere being I am 'boxed in' between two extreme gathers (Mystery <br/>
&amp; Flamingo).<br/>
<br/>
Still amazed at Nathan/Cyclonic's Event Stamp and even in the dark <br/>
with Phynstar the Covered Bridges were a thrill. And I got all 6 <br/>
pieces perfectly aligned and stamped the first time around.<br/>
<br/>
Wish I had left time to ride the Phoenix a second time, once is not <br/>
enough!<br/>

Thanks Indigo for your post/pics which really sums up the weekend.<br/>

                    <div id="ygrps-yiv-905182507">Thanks for the kind words all.  I think the gathering went very well, <br/>
and a good time was had by all.  It was great to see some new faces as <br/>
well as some old friends.<br/>
<br/>
The final head count is around 25 or so.  I don't really know because <br/>
not everyone logged in (too destracted by the event stamp maybe?)<br/>
<br/>
I think my goal of a laid back, less intense gathering was achieved, and <br/>
I plan to do it again next year (and the ideas are already flowing :)<br/>
<br/>
I will post the clues for the Covered Bridge Tour tonight and it will be <br/>
avalible at least for the next two weeks.  I don't like all of the plant <br/>
locations, so I will probably modify it is a few weeks.<br/>
<br/>
The Saturday night campfire was a great time too, and we didn't get <br/>
yelled at this time ;)<br/>
<br/>
I am sure H&amp;H will have her infamus quotes posted soon, and thanks to <br/>
the Crayola Posse for posting those photos, they are wonderful.<br/>

great gathering. I just got home from a perfect four day weekend and<br/>
am basking in the glow.  Started out with a wonderful, wonderful time<br/>
at Knoebels- from camping there Friday night and practicing with the<br/>
neat event stamp to watching everyone emerge from the Phoenix a little<br/>
wobbly legged to meeting so many new people.  I will be posting<br/>
pictures tomorrow night of the fun that we all had.  <br/>
Then I left Knoebels for a day with my grandson who is an up and<br/>
coming letterboxer himself.  All he needs to do is learn to walk and<br/>
we will be on the trail together. <br/>
Monday, I went to the Central Pennsylvania area, an area that I feel<br/>
is the most beautiful in the state.  Barney, leader of Team Little<br/>
Dog, and I camped at Poe Paddy State Park and were the only ones in<br/>
the whole park in a driving rain.  In spite of the rain, we were able<br/>
to pick up 5 boxes yesterday before provisions in the form of a<br/>
delicious hot dinner were brought in by True Indigo and RGBisMe.  Then<br/>
today True Indigo accompanied Team Little Dog in collecting seven more<br/>
of her boxes.  Carvings by the Crayola Posse are absolutely<br/>
unbelievable - my favorite was Air Sylph which was found on an<br/>
absoloutely breathtaking vista overlooking some of the Nittany Valley.<br/>
 Terri, alias True Indigo, was an absolutely wonderful hostess and as<br/>
always was the perfect letterboxing companion.<br/>
I hated to come home to face reality again but then I got to<br/>
thinking....just a few more weeks to Boxtoberfest!<br/>

<div>I'm really sorry I didn't make it.  Enterprise didn't have a car after me making the reservation two weeks ago, and truth be told, I was looking for an excuse not to spend the money. I just got the western ny gathering trip paid off. Between renting a car here in rip off, over-priced Gotham, hotel and gas, a gathering gets to be an expensive weekend. I'm hoping I will be at the Boxtoberfest. </div>
<div> </div>
<div>As it turned out, my cat Oscar got really sick with a urinary track blockage and I had to take him to the vet Friday night just before they closed. He was pretty sick for a while but is doing ok now and should be home tomorrow. :::::::insert lay-out of large sums of money here::::::::  So I wasn't supposed to go. I'd hate to think what might have happened if I went and didn't get home until Sunday night. </div>
