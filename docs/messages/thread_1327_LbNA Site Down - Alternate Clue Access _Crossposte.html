<div><font face="Arial" size="2">There is currently a problem with access to the 
LbNA web site.  As far as I am aware, everyone is getting the error -- 
nobody has been individually denied access as the error message might seem to 
indicate.  I have not been able to contact Choi so there is no estimate as 
to possible availability time.</font></div>
<div><font face="Arial" size="2"></font> </div>
<div><font face="Arial" size="2">If you were hoping to grab some clues and go 
letterboxing today, here are a couple of alternate suggestions:</font></div>
<div><font face="Arial" size="2"></font> </div>
<div><font face="Arial" size="2">AtlasQuest - <a href="http://www.atlasquest.com" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.atlasquest.com</a> - many people 
list their boxes at both LbNA and AtlasQuest. If the box is listed at AtlasQuest 
and the clue is stored at AtlasQuest or on the user's personal web site, you 
will be able to access the clue.  If the box is listed at AtlasQuest, but 
the clue is stored on the LbNA site, you will receive an error message when 
trying to access the clue similar to the one received when trying to access the 
LbNA site.  At this point, you can click on "Cached Clue" at the far right 
of the header menu to see a cached version of the clue.  Be aware that 
the cached version is not up-to-date as the clues as cached monthly, but if the 
clue has not changed recently, this should be fine.  Also note that the 
cached version will contain only text, not graphics, so if there were pictures 
as a part of the clue, you are out of luck.</font></div>
<div><font face="Arial" size="2"></font> </div>
<div><font face="Arial" size="2">Old LbNA Site - <a href="http://lbna.dyndns.org/index.html" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://lbna.dyndns.org/index.html</a> - 
if a box is not listed on AtlasQuest and it is an older letterbox, you may be 
able to find the clue at the old LbNA web site.  Again, these clues are not 
up-to-date as changes have not been made since the new site went up 2 years ago, 
but if you are looking for a specific older box that has not had a change of 
clue, you might try this.</font></div>
<div><font face="Arial" size="2"></font> </div>
<div><font face="Arial" size="2">Personal Web Sites - Many letterboxers keep their 
clues on their personal web sites.  There are lists of personal letterboxer 
web sites in the links directory at the LbNA Yahoo! list, at many of the 
regional Yahoo! lists and at Silent Doug's web site (<a href="http://www.letterboxing.info/links/?id=14" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.letterboxing.info/links/?id=14</a>).  
Perhaps a 'boxer in your area has a personal site with their box clues and you 
could get them directly from their web site.</font></div>
<div><font face="Arial" size="2"></font> </div>
<div><font face="Arial" size="2">Sorry for the inconvenience and thanks for your 
patience!</font></div>

                    <div id="ygrps-yiv-994369770">Well, unfortunately the boxing gods were working against us this <br/>
weekend, at least a little.  We took an impromptu trip and decided to <br/>
spend the last day (today) letterboxing.  Well, duh, of COURSE we packed <br/>
our boxing stuff!!!<br/>
Anyway, we couldn't log into LBNA from the hotel, which I wanted to <br/>
blame ON the hotel, which I now realize I couldn't do.  So no clues from <br/>
there. <br/>
I did the next best thing; logged into the Yahoo groups for new <br/>
announcements and scrolled (and scrolled, and scrolled, and scrolled...) <br/>
to find Virginia placements.  We finally settled on the Waller's Mill <br/>
boxes just north of Williamsburg off I-64.  This is a beautiful little <br/>
park and the clues were wonderfully clear and concise.  EEK had very <br/>
little trouble following the clues (we had none) and all four boxes were <br/>
in great condition, with the exception of some pretty liquefied stamp <br/>
pads (best bet: bring your own).<br/>
The only bad side is that I am now a dreaded "gray hole" postal <br/>
letterboxer, but I hope to remedy that tomorrow.<br/>

<br/>
Star Wars Lego (Tom's latest nom de box) and I had hidden it there as <br/>
an 'event only' stamp, but Gerania asked that we consider leaving it <br/>
permanently and that she would take care of it should trouble arise <br/>
(as she is local and we are in the wilds of Allentown, PA).  In all <br/>
honesty, I am surprised the box lasted as long as it did, considering <br/>
the high traffic in the area and the vigilance of the local park <br/>
visitors.<br/>
<br/>
Perhaps, now that the log is chock full, it is time to retire our <br/>
silly little box.  I'll leave that call up to Gerania, as she is the <br/>
box-mom.<br/>
<br/>
Let us know what you all think.  It is an easy find.<br/>
<br/>
Also - have received some strange tiles in the mail.  Sent you an <br/>
email, but had not heard from you.  I am thinking a county named <br/>
after coal.<br/>

                    <div id="ygrps-yiv-868604891">This reminds me of my encounter with the authorities a couple of <br/>
weeks ago. It was on 9/11.<br/>
<br/>
I was scoping out a location to place my new Baltus Roll letterbox, <br/>
(named after the farmer who owned the property on which the Baltusrol <br/>
golf club is located). Baltusrol recently hosted the 2005 PGA <br/>
Championship, and security was way elevated during that event. <br/>
<br/>
I hiked in the state-owned area nearby, as Baltusrol is locked up <br/>
tighter than a Rubbermaid Seal'n Save. When I exited the forest, a <br/>
city cop was waiting for me. <br/>
<br/>
He wanted to know why I had maps of Springfield, and satellite photos <br/>
of Baltusrol. He wanted to know what was in my trunk. In my backpack. <br/>
In the bags in my backpack. He was not convinced I was just hiking. <br/>
<br/>
At one point he pointed to all the baggies and asked me if I am OCD. <br/>
<br/>
How do you explain Letterboxing to a city cop? <br/>
<br/>
I started with GeoCaching, hoping maybe he had heard of it. Nope. <br/>
<br/>
Then I sighed, and started trying to explain how there are clues and <br/>
a log book. He says, so this is some kind of innernet thing? Well, <br/>
no, see there is this letterbox; and then the cop's younger partner <br/>
interrupted and said, "oh, like in Letterboxing dot org?"<br/>
<br/>
So finally they let me go, satisfied that I wasn't going to plant a <br/>
bomb set to go off in another 11 months, when they host the next <br/>
Championship.<br/>
