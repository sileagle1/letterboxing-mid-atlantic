this weekend?<br/>
<br/>
I have been out three times in the last week and I still have not <br/>
gotten them all!<br/>
<br/>
I have done the Meadowood, Dogue Creek, Bayview, and Wood Marsh Series<br/>
<br/>
I am looking for some company to go after the Pohick boxes, Tin Tin, <br/>
Blues Clues... and am willing to walk the Kanes Creek series if anybody <br/>
still needs them...<br/>
<br/>
It has taken me about ten hours to get the thirty stamps I have. I am <br/>
so impressed by the people who got that many or more on the day of the <br/>
event... and to think Poison Ivy got 45 in one outing is incredible!<br/>
<br/>
 Anyone game?</div>
