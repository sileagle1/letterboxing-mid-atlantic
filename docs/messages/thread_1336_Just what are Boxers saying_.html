<div>Folks,</div>
<div> </div>
<div>After more than a year of recovery time since the last time I have decided I am ready to do T-Shirts again. It's like when Sean Connery briefly returned as Bond in "Never Say Never Again". Neither of us can help ourselves. Anyway, the front will be our spiffy new logo created by Crayola Posse which is on our homepage. On the back I plan to list letterboxer sayings under the title "What Boxers Are Saying". It will sort of look like this:</div>
<div> </div>
<div>               What Boxers Are Saying: </div>
<div>"Get out there and box!!!" - Mark and Sue Pepe</div>
<div>"So many boxes, so little time" - Tempus Fugit</div>
<div>"Box like nobody's lookin' "  - Poison Ivy</div>
<div>"Box Softly" - Hikers &amp; Hounds (hey, I'm allowed!!!)</div>
<div> </div>
<div>I think I have room for a few others. I am still waiting for persmission from a couple of folks. I don't want to name names, but one has recently had a run in with the authorities in NJ. Ever since he moved to CT he has been going bad...ANYWAY, do any of you have any letterbox sayings that you would like to see on the back of our new LBMA T-Shirts? If so, please submit them to me OFFLIST. They will be reviewed by a panel of distinguished judges (Dude and I) and our favorite 3 or so will be added to the shirts. Those who submit a selected saying will win.....(drum roll please)..... a FREE T-SHIRT!! Woo-Hoo!! </div>
<div> </div>
<div>Just a couple of things. No religious or political sayings please, and PLEASE do not ask me about ordering the shirts yet. I've got to get the artwork nailed down first then submit it to the sreenprinter for pricing. </div>
<div> </div>
<div>So, put on your thinking caps and send me your sayings. Or, put on your sleeping caps and take a nap if you prefer. It's really your choice. </div>
<div> </div>
<div>Box Softly,</div>
<div> </div>
