<div>I'm really new to all this but having a great time.  I found my first LB in August and was immediately hooked.  Just returned from 11 days in Connecticut and Maine (mostly Maine) and introduced some friends to this great pasttime.  We looked for 13 LB's and found 10.   We found Book Barn (1 of 2) and Relax &amp; Read by Christi in Niantic, CT.  We found Porter Preserve (all 3) and Coastal Maine Botanical Gardens (2 of the 3) by Amymisha and Stoneworks (both) by Limur and Maine Lobster in Reid State Park.  I also found my first HH!!  What a treat!  I emailed the HH owner - is it ok for me to post here the name of the HH and where I found it?  I did send an email to the HH owner letting them know I found it and where but I assume I should not post the name of the LB where I place it.  Is there a time limit on putting it in it's new home?  I have a place in mind but can't get there for a month or more.  </div>
<div> </div>
<div>This was so much fun and I really enjoyed getting out to do some hiking again.  My late husband and I used to go hiking in the cooler weather but I haven't done it in years.  I'd forgotten how much I enjoyed it and this gives me such a perfect reason to get out there again.  </div>

<div>Ok, I'll take a look and see what's close enough and get out sometime this week to place it.  I guess I kind of knew that a month was too long but was hoping to be able to put it in a specific area.  I'll take your suggestion and check before leaving to see if it's still there.    I'm in Central Florida, about 70 miles north of Tampa.  </div>

<div>Since you are getting in touch with the HH's owner anyway to let them know where it is, you could tell them you have a specific place in mind and do they mind if you hang on to it for a month. They might think the place you want to put it is cool enough to wait a month for. If they don't have a problem with that, then you can put it where you wanted to. If they say that they would rather you not keep it that long, then go by that.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Some people would mind a month and some might not. You don't know unless you ask. </div>
