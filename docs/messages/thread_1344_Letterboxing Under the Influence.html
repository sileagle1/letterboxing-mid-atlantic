<div>At the MD Renaissance Fair I went after the A Face Among the Trees box 
after visiting the beer tents several times.  Yipes!  Luckily there 
wasn't anyone around.  Got the stamp and I think I managed to scrawl 
something in the logbook.  I also tried to get the Johnny Fox box but alas, 
other people were sitting around and WOULD NOT MOVE.</div>
