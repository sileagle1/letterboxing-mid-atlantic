think that the sign that is mentioned in the clues has been removed <br/>
and maybe the box with it.  Wec ircled all over the place.  Did find <br/>
Currituck Beach Lighthouse and OBXNC while we were there, though, and <br/>
we found OBX Troll on the way home.<br/>
<br/>
OBX Troll and OBXNC are pretty nice stamps and short hikes, if you <br/>
haven't found them yet.<br/>
