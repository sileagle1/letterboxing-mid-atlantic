are usually nice enough to help you out.  <br/>

<div>Well, being deprived of the Pine Barrens by Mother Nature, I went to find 3 new boxes by Mother Duck.  Had a nice stroll around Rockwood Park.  I took Mark Pepe's advice &amp; brought my big golf umbrella (children, always listen to your Uncle Mark)--but it turned out that I didn't need it.   As my brother would say, "Twas a grand, soft day!"  </div>

broke down in the middle of nowhere, in the rain, on Saturday.  Our <br/>
alternator began dying on the highway - no windshield wipers, power <br/>
breaks or steering!  We coasted off into a tiny town called Accident, <br/>
MD, luckily found a garage and waited for our part to be driven in <br/>
from <br/>
another town.<br/>
<br/>
Back on the road again, we got quite turned around trying to go the <br/>
back way, and I mean back way, from Accident to Deep Creek Lake.  <br/>
While <br/>
on this detour we saw some cool wildlife from the car, including a <br/>
turkey family and a baby black bear bounding across the road.<br/>
<br/>
We only had time for one box - Swallow Falls Swallow.  That whole <br/>
park <br/>
is magic and I have a new favorite box.<br/>
