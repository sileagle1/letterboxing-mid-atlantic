she's started a boxing blog of her own with a great description of the <br/>
gathering. Check it out here: http://flutterbyes-<br/>
letterbox.blogspot.com/ She's also starting to plant some boxes, so you <br/>
ought to start seeing stuff from her and her daughter (Charmed One) out <br/>
in the eastern PA area soon.<br/>
<br/>
By the way, I hope I'm not too late to put in our two cents about how <br/>
much fun I had as well! I missed having the Highlander about, but the <br/>
gathering was awesome. Good rides, good stamps, great time...even got <br/>
to plant a box in the park before I left, as well as make a fool of <br/>
myself for a stamp (which, really, EVERYONE ought to get the chance to <br/>
do before they die...it's very liberating!).<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, I think we're done doing events and stuff this year, but we're <br/>
in for next year...give us a heads up!<br/>
