<div> </div>
<div>Anyway, check out the files section for details in the 2005 LBMA Tee Shirts folder. For those of you who did not purchase last time, here's how it works.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>All Orders and Questions must be emailed to me OFFLIST. I won't respond to any questions posted onlist so as not to drive everyone nuts. </div>
<div> </div>
<div>Orders must be pre-paid before I get the tees made ( I don't have the cash to lay out ahead of time, sorry!). Am shooting to have all orders received by 10/31 and all money in hand by Friday 11/04. That way I'll definately have the tees by the first weekend in December which means...</div>
<div> </div>
<div>A Gathering!! Yes, that's right, another <a href="mailto:#@$%" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">#@$%</a>&amp;! gathering!!! But, only for those folks who wish to avoid shipping costs and pick up the shirts directly from me (plus meet some local boxers and generally have a good time). Where will the gathering be, you ask? Why at TYLER STATE PARK! It's easy to get to and there are already about 1,000 boxes there so I have no prep work to do, woo-hoo!</div>
<div> </div>
<div>So, check out the files section. Email me OFFLIST with any questions. Mark your calendar and send me some money. 'Kay?</div>
<div> </div>
<div>If you have any concerns, please feel free to ask me, but folks who bought the Tees I had made last year all seemed pretty pleased with them. And the prices are great.</div>
