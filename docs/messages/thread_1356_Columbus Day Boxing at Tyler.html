weeks ago!  We decided to take a chance on the weather and, toting <br/>
ponchos, hit Tyler State Park for the second time.  Despite all the <br/>
mud (esp. on the way to the Police box, see post above) we had nice <br/>
cool, dry weather and picked up 11 boxes, our record for one day.  <br/>
Not bad for short-legged people, and I am not just talking about <br/>
myself.  Rumor has it that we might have passed the 100 box mark.  <br/>
Our list:<br/>
<br/>
Scudder Falls Bridge (rest stop open again, log book full)<br/>
VNV Nation<br/>
Radiohead (mistakenly labeled as "Rhinohead" in our logbook by B#1 -- <br/>
he thought Radiohead made no sense, as if Rhinohead does)<br/>
MukLuk Box #2<br/>
The Police<br/>
Dr. Who #2<br/>
Texas Flood SRV<br/>
The Beatles<br/>
Across the Irish Sea<br/>
Steely Dan<br/>
Nine Inch Nails (our second attempt, hurray!)<br/>
<br/>
I had to drag the rest of my team, kicking and screaming, out of the <br/>
park as they wanted to go to the other side and try for the rest.  <br/>
But those, along with the Hop Devil (which we Just Could Not Find), <br/>
will have to wait for another day.<br/>

I agree that the Hop Devil is a devlishly worded clue, but a really <br/>
cool stamp.  The gathering is afoot and this may give us an excuse to <br/>
venture forth for the rest.<br/>
