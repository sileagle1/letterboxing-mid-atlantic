<div>Really, when it comes to finding boxes I am one of the worst ever! But this one wasn't hard if you just work at it a litte and take your time. The sharp turn reference makes sense once you're on the trial. The box was originally planted last fall (I think that's when we had our "Plantapalooza Gathering) so I bet it's the spring and summer growth that makes finding the rock a challenge. Come December it'll be a cake walk.</div>
