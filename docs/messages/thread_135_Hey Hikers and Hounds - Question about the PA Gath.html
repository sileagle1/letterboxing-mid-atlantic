<br/>
I have a question for you that may be important.  The gathering is <br/>
slated for 10 July at Washington Crossing Park.  There may be a <br/>
problem with that.  The parl appears to be divided into 2 halves - a <br/>
northern half a few miles north of the southern half which actually <br/>
is in Washington Crossing, PA.  The Sullivan Pavillion behind the <br/>
Thompson-Neely House House is in the southern half (as far as I can <br/>
tell).  I am assuming this is where we are to meet.  Maybe I am <br/>
thinking too hard here.   /-}  The nerd in me is the cause.<br/>
<br/>
Please help,<br/>
<br/>

It's in both PA and NJ but Nathan is right, a good number of the boxes are around the Sullivan Pavilion behind the Thompson Neely house off of River Road. (NOTE to local boxers - This is a great time to plant a new box of two  in that area in anticipation of the gathering!) Right across the street from Bowman's Hill Wildfloer Preserve. I have rented the Pavilion from 9-3 on Saturday the 10th. Colonial Woods is supposed to be right up River Road about 20-30 minutes north of there. Hope to see you there!<br/><br/><b><i>Cyclonic07@...</i></b> wrote:

morning. For those of you heading south from New Hope along River <br/>
Road (route 32), there are two Bowman Hill areas. You want the first <br/>
one you hit "Bowman Hill Wildflower Preserve". Park on the right. <br/>
You'll see the Thompson-Neeley stone house on the left. This sounds <br/>
like a fun day!<br/>
