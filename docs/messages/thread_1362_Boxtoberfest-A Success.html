of Sight - a weekend which started with the Boxtoberfest, and the<br/>
three of us would also like to thank Letterboxingbee and her hubby for<br/>
a really nice day.  It was a bit windy which provided a little<br/>
challenge but otherwise the weather was perfect after a really gloomy<br/>
week.  Bev's logmaking class was invaluable to me, I have always<br/>
wanted to learn how to make a logbook that was more than a bunch of<br/>
index cards and never would have figured it out myself.  I met some<br/>
new boxers which is always a lot of fun and said hello to a lot of old<br/>
friends.  A special thanks again to Rob for rescuing Out of Sight<br/>
again this year - preventing her from being stung by a bee in her soda<br/>
can.  My one regret was that I didn't get a chance to find any of the<br/>
planted boxes, traveling with a baby also presents its own challenges<br/>
but we did have a wonderful time.<br/>
Thanks again,<br/>
Jan of Team Little Dog<br/>

<br/>
<br/>
I had such a great time meeting all the new boxers and saying hello to<br/>
the ones I've met before.  The only down part was the winds.  My<br/>
husband even said he had a good time talking with everyone.  Those of<br/>
you who spoke with my sister and her family as they stopped by said<br/>
that the ENTIRE group was very very nice to her and her family.  I<br/>
told her "Letterboxers are the BEST people in the world!" and she<br/>
whole heartely agreed.  I enjoyed teaching the logbook class - I only<br/>
wished I could have spent more time 'explaining' things better.  But<br/>
at least those who took the class can get a better understanding of<br/>
how to sew signatures together. <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I will be posting the many pictures I took later today.  A special<br/>
THANKS to everyone who hung around and helped clean up.  And a little<br/>
thank you to "Stalking Wolf" who kept us late ones entertained for<br/>
some time.  At the very end we had some bad news that a very very dear<br/>
friend of the family had passed away during the day and we left to go<br/>
console the family.  In doing so, I left 2 of the event boxes on the<br/>
table.  A BIG THANK YOU to "The Pirate Queen" for picking up the boxes<br/>
for me.  <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Thanks again to everyone for coming to the gathering.  And those that<br/>
made a donation to the food drive MANY people will thank you.  There<br/>
sure was a lot of food collected.  I will be dropping the food off<br/>
this week to the food bank.  <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I had a GREAT time - now........ to make plans for next years<br/>
.....hmmmmmm...........<br/>

<br/>
2 of the 4 boxes I had to pull for not being in a 'good' spot so I<br/>
will hopefully get to replant those 2 later on.  But the 2 that remain<br/>
I have put up on the LbNA.org site.  Have fun!</div>
