practically in our own backyard.  We were away for the weekend in the <br/>
beautiful but very soggy Hudson Valley attending the HUGE sheep and <br/>
wool festival.  (Our name isn't "farm" for nothing...)  We managed to <br/>
get in a little 'boxing in between sheep and wool events, but <br/>
unfortunately it was raining so darn hard on Thurs and Fri, our prime <br/>
boxing days, that we couldn't do as much as we would have liked.<br/>
<br/>
We plan to do more when we head up there again next year.  We <br/>
understand the layout of the area better so we can plan our trip out, <br/>
plus it looks like Talking Turtle will have provided us with an <br/>
entirely new series by then... One of our regrets was having to miss <br/>
the hike at Poet's Walk.  It started to pour just after we finished <br/>
our lunch at the Pavilion and we were forced to beat a retreat to the <br/>
car.  We loved what we could see and could only imagine the beauty of <br/>
the rest, which unfortunately was wreathed in fog while we were there.<br/>

in Middletown, VA.  Much fun was had, many stories will be told, and I <br/>
managed to get two boxes on the weekend as well:<br/>
<br/>
Mason-Dixon box (in good shape, great Carvin' Carmin stamp)<br/>
Wild, Wonderful West Virginia (also an easy find, in good shape, giant <br/>
stamp)<br/>
<br/>
Sounds like everyone had fun, even without me ;-)  Looking forward to <br/>
the December Gathering.<br/>
