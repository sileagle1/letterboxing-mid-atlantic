husband for hosting a great gathering in NJ! <br/>
<br/>
Team SuddenTurkey had a great time, even though we didn't arrive until<br/>
after Gwenllian took the PSAT and Lil'e had her morning nap! Gwenllian<br/>
and I especially loved the logbook making tutorial! We learned so<br/>
much! Gwenllian was so inspired that, as soon as we got home, she made<br/>
a handmade logbook, covered it with fractal-inspired paper and finally<br/>
carved her first stamp in her Fractal Series of letterboxes. Look for<br/>
Sierpinski's Carpet soon - it's all ready to go, it just needs to be<br/>
planted! Thanks, Bev, for a GREAT class!<br/>
<br/>
It was great getting to see old buddies again and to meet new buddies!<br/>
It was nice to put some faces to names we've seen on the list.<br/>
<br/>
Lil'e and iplaytunes had a great time chatting with Out of Sight and<br/>
Dn'A and Stalking Wolf. Baby loved her first gathering!<br/>
