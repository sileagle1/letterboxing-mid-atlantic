Pocohantas State Park has TONS of them. There is a series of 5 that <br/>
I didn't get to do.  Anyone up to do it this summer?  My boyfriend <br/>
is starting a new schedule at work, and we don't know when we'll be <br/>
able to box again together.<br/>
<br/>
I'm ready to put my first box out.  I have my eye on a rest area on <br/>
I-95, about 20 miles south of DC.  I pass it everyday on my way to <br/>
work.  I'll have to find a REALLY good spot though before leaving it <br/>
in such a high traffic area.<br/>
<br/>
I havent been able to post to any of my groups in a while, something <br/>
wrong with my email.  Anyone else have the problem.  I finally had <br/>
to change my email address.<br/>

think there was a gathering in Pocahontas in 9/2002. One of the boxes <br/>
I found had been stamped by about 20 people on the same day.  But if <br/>
we wanna do a get together, it's been a while, and there are probably <br/>
lots of new people, or we can get another park, but Pocahontas is <br/>
beautiful.  Or, we could just have a small gathering :)<br/>
