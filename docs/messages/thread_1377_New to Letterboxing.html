I doubt the big corporate mouse will have any indigestion over a <br/>
letterboxing stamp.  Hiding stuff for the younger boxers is cool, <br/>
and I suggest you look up Hikers and Hounds as she has hidden some <br/>
kid oriented boxes (the Caterpillar).<br/>
<br/>
You can check your box as often as you like.  Like H+H said <br/>
previously, sometimes things move a little slowly at first until <br/>
people start coming.  I was pretty eager at first, but now I get out <br/>
to my boxes when I can (which is not as often as I'd like).  By all <br/>
means, post your creations on the www.letterboxing.org website and <br/>
folks will come (well, at least Star Wars Lego and I will).<br/>

hard to get in).<br/>
<br/>
If you are happy with the stamp, then it doesn't matter what the image <br/>
is.  There are all kinds of boxes out there, so geared toward kids, some <br/>
towards families, some towards adults.  Some are easy to get, some are <br/>
not.  It is all up to the placer what they want to do.  Have fun with it!<br/>
<br/>
I have some boxes I have not checked on in over a year (I really should <br/>
check on them some more).  Once a week, once a month, it is up to you <br/>
when you want to check up on them.<br/>
<br/>
Hope to see you on the trail, or more likely at a gathering (since I <br/>
never run into anyone on the trail).<br/>

I appreciate any advice.  Since we're so new at Letterboxing there is that<br/>
big fear of doing something wrong.  That will pass after we've successfully<br/>
launched our first set of boxes I think.    <br/>

&gt;I doubt the big corporate mouse will have any indigestion over a <br/>
&gt;letterboxing stamp.  Hiding stuff for the younger boxers is cool, <br/>
&gt;and I suggest you look up Hikers and Hounds as she has hidden some <br/>
&gt;kid oriented boxes (the Caterpillar).<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;You can check your box as often as you like.  Like H+H said <br/>
&gt;previously, sometimes things move a little slowly at first until <br/>
&gt;people start coming.  I was pretty eager at first, but now I get out <br/>
&gt;to my boxes when I can (which is not as often as I'd like).  By all <br/>
&gt;means, post your creations on the www.letterboxing.org website and <br/>
&gt;folks will come (well, at least Star Wars Lego and I will).<br/>

&gt;Welcome to the club (membership is free and open to all, so it is not <br/>
&gt;hard to get in).<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;If you are happy with the stamp, then it doesn't matter what the image <br/>
&gt;is.  There are all kinds of boxes out there, so geared toward kids, some <br/>
&gt;towards families, some towards adults.  Some are easy to get, some are <br/>
&gt;not.  It is all up to the placer what they want to do.  Have fun with it!<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;I have some boxes I have not checked on in over a year (I really should <br/>
&gt;check on them some more).  Once a week, once a month, it is up to you <br/>
&gt;when you want to check up on them.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Hope to see you on the trail, or more likely at a gathering (since I <br/>
&gt;never run into anyone on the trail).<br/>

other people, and share stamps and stories.  Thanks for the welcome and the<br/>
words of encouragement.<br/>
