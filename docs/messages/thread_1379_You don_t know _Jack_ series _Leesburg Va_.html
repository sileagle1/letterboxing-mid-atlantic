                    <div id="ygrps-yiv-839615761">Hi all,<br/>
  I hope to have the last of the "Jack" series placed today. The series <br/>
is made up of six boxes as follows: "Shadow in the fog","Lurking","He's <br/>
watching","Jack Attack"," Montague John Druitt", and "Jack". There is <br/>
no specific order to the boxes, they were placed to have people enjoy a <br/>
day in Leesburg. Old Leesburg offers wonderful old streets with nice <br/>
shops, great restaurants, Abundant history, and haunted tours year <br/>
round. The boxes are for Halloween, but will stay permanent unless <br/>
problems start with boxes going missing. I am trying to get two more <br/>
boxes planted for halloween also, but not sure this will happen. Happy <br/>
Halloween to all!<br/>
                Safe trails,<br/>
