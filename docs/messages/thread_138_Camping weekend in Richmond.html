<br/>
I'd love to attend this!  We live in Mexico City, and I've been living<br/>
vicariously through all of you who live in places where there are<br/>
letterboxes for the past six weeks.  All the great finds, plants, and<br/>
camping gatherings have just whet my appetite!  We're moving back to the DC<br/>
area in September, and would love to meet you all at a camping weekend in<br/>
Richmond sometime this fall.<br/>

&gt; We had a fun weekend.  We went to Richmond, VA for LBing.<br/>
&gt; Pocohantas State Park has TONS of them. There is a series of 5 that<br/>
&gt; I didn't get to do.  Anyone up to do it this summer?  My boyfriend<br/>
&gt; is starting a new schedule at work, and we don't know when we'll be<br/>
&gt; able to box again together.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I'm ready to put my first box out.  I have my eye on a rest area on<br/>
&gt; I-95, about 20 miles south of DC.  I pass it everyday on my way to<br/>
&gt; work.  I'll have to find a REALLY good spot though before leaving it<br/>
&gt; in such a high traffic area.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I havent been able to post to any of my groups in a while, something<br/>
&gt; wrong with my email.  Anyone else have the problem.  I finally had<br/>

You are so kind and welcoming!  It was so fun to read the list over the past<br/>
couple weeks and see that there was someone in Fairfax!  And you're<br/>
travelling to Littleton?  What a coincidence--I grew up there.<br/>
<br/>
We're back on Labor Day, so sometime after that would be great for us.<br/>
Sept. 28-29 could be really cool--a full moon, and not so late in the year<br/>
that it would be really chilly.  (I did vote in the poll as well, but since<br/>
you were being so nice I thought I should send an email as well!)<br/>
<br/>
BTW, I think we're going to plant our first two boxes this weekend.  I was<br/>
hoping they'd be the first in Mexico, but someone just beat us to it with a<br/>
box in Cozumel.  Oh well, the more boxes the better for all of us!<br/>
