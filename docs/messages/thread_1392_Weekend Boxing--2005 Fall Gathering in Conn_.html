<div><font size="2">This was a little different. You had to work your way up the mountain finding the boxes to get to the pavillion at the top for meeting and greeting. After hauling myself up said mountain, I had very little energy for meeting, greeting *or* exchanging, so I sat around staring into space and being anti-social most of the time. It was windy and cold up there, but some spectacular views of the surrounding countryside. They're posted on atlasquest. Not very original photos, but it gives you and idea of where we were, how high we had to climb, drag, crawl. Actually I was the only one crawling, bringing up the rear most of the time, but it was still fun. </font></div>
