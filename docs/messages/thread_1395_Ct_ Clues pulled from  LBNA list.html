   I post this here for those that may be heading to CT. in the future. <br/>
I had Mark Pepe post this to the other lists involved. For those not <br/>
aware; a newspaper article about a series in the town included clues to <br/>
boxes. I am from this town and, unfortunately, feel that vandalism may <br/>
occur as a result. It may not, but I am not willing to take the risk. <br/>
Sorry if this inconveniences anyone from this group. The post was as <br/>
follows:<br/>
<br/>
 With the recent article regarding letterboxing in Winsted Ct., I have <br/>
decided to remove my clues from the LBNA list. I am concerned that with <br/>
clues posted easily in the article, that vandalism may occur and <br/>
possibly spill over into researching clues to do so with other boxes. I <br/>
realize that this may not be perceived as the best thing to do or as <br/>
a "Knee jerk" reaction. So be it. My feeling is as is and I will not <br/>
put my boxes or local wilderness areas at risk. I hope I am wrong, I am <br/>
from Winsted and hope better of it.<br/>
   The clues to those boxes will be by WOM. I can also be contacted on <br/>
the LBMA group.<br/>
   Again, I hope I am wrong about what this article will do. I'm sorry <br/>
for any inconvenience. The Four Directions clues will remain in place <br/>
temporarily, but will likely be effected as well.<br/>
  I bid you all safe trails.     Koyote</div>

<div>I don't blame you at all for pulling the clues. I'm always of the opinion that none of these articles get printed without some kind of input from a local boxer. I don't think these reporters get these ideas off the top of their head. And the boxers who take part in the publicity need to put their egos aside and think about the hobby instead. </div>

<font face="Arial,sans-serif"><font size="2">I disagree.  If the boxer
is responsible, they are not going to lead a reporter to a permanent
box, but instead set something up that is disposable.  A bunch of punk
kids or trouble makers are not going to go through all of the trouble
of looking up a box, figuring out clues, and hunting it only to then
destroy it.  It would only happen if they are told right where the box
is.  So, you create a cheap, disposable box, planting just for the
reporter, and if it disappears a week later, so be it.  But, in that
time you may get someone who never heard of it interested in it, and
that is always a good thing.<br/>

<div>What I meant was that I think some people get their egos inflated by somehow being involved in being asked about boxing, maybe mentioning it to someone they know is a reporter, things along that line.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>As for getting someone new interested in the hobby, I think enough of that happens by accident without hordes of people being led to it by the media. </div>
