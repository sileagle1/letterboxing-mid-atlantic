donated non-perishables to the Camden County food bank in Pennsauken.<br/>
 My husband explained what letterboxing was to the lady who seemed<br/>
very intriged (sp?) to find out more about it.  She said she was going<br/>
to mail a receipt or record of the donation and I was going to post it<br/>
for you all but so far it has not arrived yet.  I was also going to<br/>
post all the pictures I took to my blog but haven't quite "mastered"<br/>
the 'blog thing' yet.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks again to everyone who came out to Boxtoberfest!!  And a bigger<br/>
thank you to everyone who made a donation to the food drive.  We all<br/>
donated more than 50 pounds of goods.  Thank you!!  Thank you!!  Thank<br/>
you!!<br/>
