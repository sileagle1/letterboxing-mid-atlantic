lurking for a few weeks now, but haven't had anything to say. :)<br/>
<br/>
We live in SE PA and letterboxing is our new family hobby.  I have 3 <br/>
full-time partners-in-crime, my children who are 12,10,&amp;6, and one <br/>
part-time partner, my husband.  My husband was kind of ho-hum about <br/>
the whole thing until he went with us on his first hunt.  We went up <br/>
to Nolde Forest State Park for Memorial Day where we only found the <br/>
first box (Double Seven).  What a challenge!  Anyway, he was more <br/>
excited than the rest of us when we finally found it and now he's <br/>
hooked.<br/>
<br/>
We were in Green Lane today!  That's what drove me out of <br/>
hibernation.  I didn't even know where that was until yesterday and I <br/>
didn't even think to double check for boxes.  We're going camping up <br/>
there next weekend at Boulder Woods Campground and I'm sure everyone <br/>
will by excited when I tell them how many boxes are around there.<br/>
<br/>
This is a great list!<br/>
