<div><font face="Arial" size="2">For those who have been fortunate enough to attend 
a gathering, what kinds of things go on? I would presume boxing happens as well

wanted to see High Point state park and that area, but never seemed <br/>
to have a good enough reason to get there.  <br/>
<br/>
My schedule's pretty open between mid-April and August, so any day <br/>
would be great.  Sounds like a lot of fun.  <br/>

Day Gathering! June 5 is great - June 12 is out. Late May, early June <br/>
sounds good - Saturdays are good. Sunday is tougher unless it is <br/>
after 1 or 2 PM.<br/>
<br/>
We're newer to boxing, but willing to jump right in and help as much <br/>
as we can. Looking forward to meeting fellow boxers!\<br/>
