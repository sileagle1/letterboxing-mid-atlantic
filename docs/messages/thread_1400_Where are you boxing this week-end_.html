the boxes, but it was a nice 3-mile hike. <br/>
<br/>
We had planned to box on Saturday as a family but even though it was <br/>
sooo nice I thought that the ground would be too wet almost <br/>
everywhere... and only today remembered that we want to do boxes in <br/>
Manhattan and Brooklyn, and urban boxing would have been perfect on <br/>
Saturday.<br/>
<br/>
Today after the soccer tournament we stopped at the location of a new <br/>
box planted in November by a noxer, and of course her box is already <br/>
missing. Obviously too near the trail.<br/>

&gt; Dang! I don't know how it happened but i have a free sat! The rest of <br/>
my family has plans <br/>
&gt; that do not involve me. i do have to be fairly close to home to <br/>
supply a ride for my daughter <br/>

Mapsurfer box. Anyone <br/>
