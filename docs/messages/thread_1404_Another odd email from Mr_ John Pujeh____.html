<br/>
My name is Mr. John Pujeh.  In September 2004 my letterbox was <br/>
muggled<br/>
and the PFX collectors were hounding me like you wouldn't believe. I <br/>
had no Douggerware and my carving supplies were running out.  The <br/>
only<br/>
escape I had from the pressure of online letterboxing was my computer<br/>
and my hiking boots. I longed to turn my avocation into my vocation.<br/>
This January 2005 my hairy legged comrades and I found many <br/>
difficult <br/>
mystery boxes of the Mapsurfian variety and we were able to boost <br/>
our <br/>
PFX count by multitudes.  I was able to purchase new Douggerware and <br/>
carving materials.<br/>
<br/>
I am currently hiding a new box near the bridge of my benefactor, <br/>
the <br/>
man called Bogert in the County of Lehigh, with a beautiful view of <br/>
a <br/>
stream stocked with private trout, scenic rocks and remarkable <br/>
double <br/>
trees.  I will never have to plant again.<br/>
<br/>
Today I have the worlds highest PFX count!!!  I have PFX in excess <br/>
of <br/>
two million and exceed the PFX count of even Dr. Evil.  I hope to <br/>
approach PFC 2 million and one if you follow the following <br/>
instructions.  Anyone can do the same.  This finding process program <br/>
works perfectly every time, 100% of the time if you follow the <br/>
instructions and the box remains. I have NEVER failed to hide this <br/>
box <br/>
and your PFX count will increase by at least one if you follow the <br/>
instructions.  Best of all you never have to leave the county of <br/>
Northampton except to seek this treasure.<br/>
<br/>
In October 2004, I received an email letter telling me how I could <br/>
earn <br/>
PFX 50,000 or more whenever I wanted. I was naturally very skeptical <br/>
and filed the email as spam. It's funny though, when you are <br/>
desperate <br/>
to boost your PFX count, backed into a corner, your mind does crazy <br/>
things. I spent a frustrating day looking through my deleted emails <br/>
to <br/>
find this secret.  I tried to go online and seek wisdom at the main <br/>
LBNA message board and all I saw was disagreements and discontent. I <br/>
eventually found that email in the bowels of my computer. All at <br/>
once <br/>
it came to me, I now had the key to my dreams of boosting my PFX <br/>
count.<br/>
I realized that with the power of the computer, a compass and my own <br/>
two feet I could expand and enhance this PFX formula into the most <br/>
unbelievable PFX generator that has ever been created.  Follow these <br/>
instructions and if they pan out you will increase your PFX count by <br/>
at <br/>
least one.  Be discrete, as others may be watching.  All the LBNA <br/>
disclaimers apply.<br/>
<br/>
Find the bridge near where my other treasure is kept, but take the <br/>
northern gravel path in a northeasterly direction.  Shoot the gap <br/>
betwixt the buildings and continue onward where motor vehicles are <br/>
not <br/>
permitted.  Your path will approach the creek of private trout and <br/>
the <br/>
double tree that reaches out over the waters.  From the tree's base <br/>
find a large tree at 300Â° uphill 8 paces to a flat rock behind.<br/>
<br/>
There you shall find the secret of increasing your PFX count by at <br/>
least one.<br/>
<br/>
Please remember to pass this on to ensure that friends benefit from <br/>
these secrets.<br/>
<br/>
