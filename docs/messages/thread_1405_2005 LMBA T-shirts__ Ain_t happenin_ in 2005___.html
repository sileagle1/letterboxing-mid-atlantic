<div>Well, I even gave it an extra week but didn't reach the 100 I needed to place the order. Only got orders for about 50, SO must just not be a good time of year or something. No problem. I'm still going to have the Tyler T-Shirt Gather Dec 3 in Tyler Park, Pa. I figured, what the hell! Instead of handing out LBMA T-shirts I am now asking everyone to wear their favorite band shirts (if they want to). There is a great series of boxes there, the Battle of the Bands, that make this tie in really well. Plus I have about 3-4 new boxes there that I haven't gotten around to posting yet. We also have a Doctor Who, a Hop Devil and all kinds of cool stuff. SO let's go for it anyway and maybe the shirts will happen next year. </div>
<div> </div>
<div>Anyone who handed me checks at the Boxtoberfest Gather I will shred them. Please void them in your register. Anyone who gave me cash I'll be contacting you to return it. </div>
<div> </div>
<div>I'll also delete the file from LBNA as I know the files section is pretty full and we were asked by the moderators to please clean it up. I'm remove it from Newboxers too but will leave on LBMA and see what kind of response we get for next year maybe.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Hope everyone who had decent weather was able to get out and enjoy it. Dude and I did and feel great! Hope you do too!</div>

<div>Too bad about the t-shirts. Maybe next year. </div>
<div> </div>
<div>I finally got my new 6 box series all done, timed the trail w/o hiding a clue writing, changed the location on one of them, and got those all posted, got two others all done, camoed and posted. It was a great day for walking the trail. Yes, we have trails in Gotham. Got a swamp too, but that's another box!! </div>
