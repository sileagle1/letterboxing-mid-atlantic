Some just disappeared from view, rarely to be seen again....<br/>

The one we found was Jolly G-Man's NJ Mystery Box.  You may be able <br/>
to find it using the wayback machine (www.waybackmachine.com) and put <br/>
in www.letterboxing.org and go to like 2002 sometime.<br/>

We actually used that clue to work our way backwards and crack the <br/>
mysteries listed that we hadn't done yet in NJ.<br/>
