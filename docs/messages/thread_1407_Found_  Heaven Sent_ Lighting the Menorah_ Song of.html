<br/>
Just a quick report.<br/>
<br/>
We found these letterboxes on Saturday, a spectacular day for <br/>
letterboxing and playing in the stream up at Elizabeth's Furnace.<br/>
<br/>
Lighting the Menorah and Song of the Robin by Wordfried, and Heaven <br/>
Sent by Corbinsmom were all fun to find (Lighting the Menorah is a <br/>
little bit of a challenge, since the mural referred to seems to have <br/>
been painted over?).<br/>
<br/>
Plan some time in the Shenandoah Valley, especially with the late <br/>
peak colors.  Wordfried has put many of them out here, some easy and <br/>
some difficult. <br/>
<br/>
(OK, I still can't find Wordfried's letterbox near the Woodstock <br/>
Tower after 4 or 5 searches, but there is another letterbox up there <br/>
to make the trip worthwhile--and climb the tower by all means!)<br/>
<br/>
Thanks,<br/>
