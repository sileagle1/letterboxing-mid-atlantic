any of the old boxes by Martian Maggot. She picked some great <br/>
locations, and sometimes you will find one, but most of the time <br/>
everything has changed and the clues are no longer helpful or <br/>
applicable. I see that the Cahillys, the von der Insels, SpringChick, <br/>
and Warcat76 have recently attempted MartianMaggot boxes. <br/>
<br/>
Anyway, I tried and failed to find either "Somewhere in New Jersey" <br/>
box, the first at Edison Tower in Menlow Park... the clue says the <br/>
keeper of the tower knows the location of this box, but the tower is <br/>
closed. <br/>
<br/>
And the second at the "War of the Worlds" at Van Nest Park near <br/>
Plainsboro -- the clues no longer make any sense. <br/>

The latest find recorded for these boxes was in 2002.</div>

board that you'd found a Martian Maggot box? If so, do tell. I just <br/>
hate to go out over and over again for a box that's probably long gone. <br/>
It was Phyto (I believe) who said that MM is living in Maine (I <br/>
think!). Is the move permanent? Will it mean no further MM box <br/>
maintenance? Did I misspell anything?<br/>
