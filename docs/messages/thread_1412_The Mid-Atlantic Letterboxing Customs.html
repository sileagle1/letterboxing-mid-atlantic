Between planters planting containers too small to accomodate an inkpad and others just choosing not to include one, I never presume that a letterbox has ink supplied. To me, it's always a bonus when someone provides their ink for me to use.<br/>
<br/>
Lately, a portion of stamps have had so much residue, I was able to stamp the image into my journal with the ink that was leftover from the prior visitor. Not even a spit shine or wiping a stamp clean on the back of your clue, let alone the other cleaning tips that have been bandied about on various forums. However, that's a rant for a later time.<br/>

other hand we went letterboxing this weekend in Tyler park.  Of the <br/>
four boxes we found not one had an ink pad! But we pack our own ink <br/>
anyway so no big deal.  It just takes twice as long because the 5 of <br/>
us had to share one ink pad.<br/>
