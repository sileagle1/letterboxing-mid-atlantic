<div><font face="Arial" size="2">Thanks! Great day for hunting this box!  
Thanks for posting to the group too.  My Internet is down and can't search 
for new boxes right now.  If you could e-mail me directly I have questions 
about that certain other box.... I thought for sure I knew where it 
was.</font></div>

  new box</div>
<div><br/></div><tt>Yup, finally got around to doing something 
  ;)<br/><br/>Actually, this is one of Silent Dougs' boxes that I was supposed to 
  <br/>plant sometime ago, somewhere here in Pennsylvania, of my chosing.  I 
  <br/>decided to plant it in Susquehannock (that is a mouthful) State 
  Park.  I <br/>was headed to Lancaster anyway, so I got up early on Sunday 
  morning and <br/>did some hefty hiking.  I have forwarded to clues to 
  Duck, but decided I <br/>would give the folks here a heads up as well, in case 
  anyone was feeling <br/>adventurous.<br/><br/>For those in the know, I checked on 
  a certain other box in that park, <br/>and it was a little waterlogged but the 
  log was in fine shape.  I <br/>resealed it well.  It had not been 
  found since January.<br/><br/>Anyway, here are the clues:<br/><br/>PA State Tile 
  #371: Rabbit<br/><br/>Authored by Silent Doug and Clueless<br/>Planted by 
  Cyclonic<br/><br/>Clue Difficulty: Easy.  Clues are straight forward and 
  direct.  Some <br/>compass work may be needed<br/>Hike Difficulty: 
  Moderate.  Several elevation changes over varying <br/>terrain.  
  Elevation changes may be very steep.  Some off trail hiking <br/>may be 
  needed.<br/>Time: Allow 1.5 to 2 hours to complete.<br/><br/>Clues:<br/><br/>Make 
  your way to Suspuehannock State Park in Lancaster County, 
  <br/>Pennsylvania.  The park is located in the Southern portion of the 
  county <br/>just off PA 372 and overlooks the Susquahanna River.  The park 
  is named <br/>after the native Susquehannock Indians, of which none actually 
  remain. <br/>On the parks grounds is the Landis House, whose sixth owner, Jacod 
  <br/>Schoff, participated in smuggling escaped slaves through the 
  <br/>"Underground Railroad."  The park has two overlooks, the southern of 
  <br/>which overlokks St. Johnson Island, the world's first bald eagle 
  <br/>sancuary.  The northern overlook looks north towards the Route 372 
  <br/>bridge and Holtwood Dam.  Start here.<br/><br/>Follow the orange blazes 
  downhill.  When you come to a "T" intersection, <br/>head 
  left.<br/><br/>Soon you will come to a trail that forbids horses, follow this 
  trail.<br/><br/>When given the choice to go up or down, take the high 
  road.<br/><br/>Once you make it to the flowing water, follow the trail as it 
  heads <br/>upstream.<br/><br/>Soon, you will encounter a boulder in the 
  path.  Behind the boulder and <br/>across the path is a small tree with a 
  blaze on it pearched atop a <br/>natural pile of rocks.  Under this tree 
  you will find a crevase with a <br/>rock stuffed into it.  Behind this 
  rock you will find your prize.<br/><br/>Enjoy!<br/><br/>--<br/>Nathan
