<br/>
Just a quick note:  Fossil Pit is safe, sound, and well covered now.  <br/>
Nice new logbook, too.  Camp Roosevelt is closed for the season now, <br/>
but you can still park by the gate and walk in.  Or at least that is <br/>
what we did.<br/>
<br/>
At the other end of Fort Valley, the Iron Furnace is now waiting for <br/>
a <br/>
visitor who wants to spend a nice quiet day hiking or camping in the <br/>
mountains.  At one time, there were apparently 19 pig iron furnaces <br/>
in <br/>
the valley.  Find the Iron Furnace to see one--at least my best <br/>
representation of one.<br/>
<br/>
If you need more boxes to lure you into the valley, take the road <br/>
west at the Fort Valley post office, up to the Woodstock Tower and <br/>
Seven Bends boxes.  Down the other side into Woodstock, and the <br/>
Shenandoah Valley.  Go north on 11 to pick up The Table, and a few of <br/>
Wordfried's letterboxes.  <br/>
<br/>
Lunch at Jalisco's in Front Royal, and go home happy.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks,<br/>
