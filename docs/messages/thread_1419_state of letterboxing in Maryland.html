here on the mid-Atlantic list as well. I'd like to ask a general <br/>
question about boxing in Maryland.<br/>
<br/>
Judging from the discussion here on this group and on the number of <br/>
new boxes planted over on LBNA, I have the impression that Md. perhaps <br/>
has fewer folks actively planting and seeking than the other Mid-<br/>
Atlantic states.<br/>
<br/>
Is that accurate? What would you say is the state of boxing in the <br/>
Free State?<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for any perspective you'd be willing to share!<br/>

</span></blockquote>Well, it is a relatively small state. :) Participation ebbs and flows. <br/>
Some folks enjoy seeking more than hiding. The few boxes I've placed <br/>
seem to get good traffic. (Don't yell at me Scarab, I've got another <br/>
ready to hide!) LBNA lists over 200 boxes in MD and I know that I <br/>
haven't found all of them! We're just as inclined to cross a state <br/>
line to find a letterbox, especially if we know the carving or the <br/>
location/hike is likely to be exceptional.<br/>
