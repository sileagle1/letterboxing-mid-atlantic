<br/>
I was both delighted and shamed to hear of your new plant in western <br/>
PA. I grew up in that area and have a place on the Yough near <br/>
Confluence (that little town near where you started your kayak trip <br/>
11 miles upstream from Ohiopyle). I'm glad you enjoyed the area, I <br/>
love it there. Which campground did you stay in? BTW, this year is <br/>
by far the most rain I'v ever seen there. We needed it because we're <br/>
coming off a 3 year drought but we haven't had a weekend without <br/>
rain yet this year and we've seen something that I've never seen in <br/>
those mountains in 40 years; mudslides. I'm also shamed because I've <br/>
been meaning for years to plant some boxes up there as I know the <br/>
area intimately (I used to skip school and go up there for the day). <br/>
There are sooooo many great hiding spots up there. I will admit that <br/>
selfishness may have fueled my laziness as the area has grown <br/>
exponentially in tourism since I was a kid. It used to be that only <br/>
locals knew about the place but whitewater has taken off and they <br/>
keep expanding the roads and building bigger parking lots. The last <br/>
expansion of the roads really spoiled a lot of the natural beauty, <br/>
they removed half of a mountain for part of it but I guess that's <br/>
the idiot highway engineers fault not the tourists. Next time you'll <br/>
have to try the lower yough, the middle is kind of a kiddie ride and <br/>
if you really want thrills plan an Upper Yough trip. If you get back <br/>
to the area contact me and I'll give you some more tips for local <br/>
sights and local LB sites.<br/>

We stayed at the campgrounds within Ohiopyle State Park. <br/>
As for the Yough, I know that the Middle was a kiddie ride, but it <br/>
was my first ride so I needed to test the waters (no pun intended) <br/>
before tackling the Lower. Next time!<br/>
I can imagine it has turned into a tourist mecca, which is always a <br/>
shame when natural beauty is spoiled...<br/>
<br/>
Yours,<br/>
