this thing.  Started a few months back) is liable to be out <br/>
letterboxing Sunday at Tyler.  We'll have to make sure to let our new <br/>
companions know that we have to be a bit more discreet and talk a <br/>
little softer.  They are very new to this, last week was their first <br/>
time out.  They've done orienteering, but never heard of <br/>
letterboxing.  They're now hooked.  Anyway, we have quite a few more <br/>
boxes to find at Tyler, and elsewhere.  Thanks to a few of you I now <br/>
realize that there's a trickster about who likes to switch hiding <br/>
spots with other boxes.  Interesting.  So we have to go back on our <br/>
original quest again this weekend.  Oh, what a chore. :) Maybe one of <br/>
these days we'll run into one of you.  Look for clues in the coming <br/>
weeks for my first attempt at planting.  Hope it turns out well.</div>

A bunch of us will be there so you'll be able to do exchanges, hang out and share trail stories, eat whatever food I throw in my trunk at the last second and just generally have a GREAT time! So, maybe you want to head somewhere else this weekend and save Tyler for the 3rd? OR, since there are so many boxes there, just c'mon back on the 3rd, from around, oh heck I forgot what time I said. I'll have to check out my own post and re-post the gather info. Take care and hope to meet you all there!!!<br/><br/><b><i>wreckraiderscuba &lt;wreckraiderscuba@...&gt;</i></b> wrote:  <blockquote><span title="qreply"> <blockquote class="ygrps-yiv-1192236025replbq" style="PADDING-LEFT:5px;MARGIN-LEFT:5px;BORDER-LEFT:#1010ff 2px solid;"><tt>Not too bad on Sunday.  The Treehouse Gang (we're relatively new to <br/>this thing.  Started a few months back) is liable to be out <br/>letterboxing Sunday at Tyler.  We'll
