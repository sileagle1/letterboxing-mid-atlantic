                    <div id="ygrps-yiv-727616848">Today I embarked on a project that I have long wanted to do. I am <br/>
working on a letterbox series that will promote a renewed look at the <br/>
Civil War that so horribly divided this nation. I will be planting <br/>
boxes at different points of interest both well known and some quite <br/>
forgotten. They will cover many varied aspects of the war. My interest <br/>
in this conflict started at a young age when hearing of My Great-Great <br/>
Grandfather's fighting for the Union in the 3rd and 15th New York <br/>
Volunteer Cavalry. Some boxes will relate to his diaries. There is no <br/>
specific number of boxes to this series. Clues will be posted in <br/>
various forms/forums, some public and some not so public. There will be <br/>
some that are WOM only. They will vary in difficulty. There will likely <br/>
be some twists and surprises along the way.<br/>
   This is a large project and therefore I would encourage anyone who <br/>
wishes to contribute to this, to do so. I will gladly plant a box for <br/>
you, or please, plant one with this theme at a location near you.<br/>
  I planted the first installment today, "Battle of Cool Spring". I <br/>
have 8 more ready to go and will continue to add to them. I hope you <br/>
all enjoy and find it an interesting adventure. I wish you all safe <br/>
trails.  Koyote</div>

<div><font face="Arial" size="2">One of the aspects that has been under-appreciated 
by many outside the Shenandoah Valley is the geurrilla actions in the border 
states.  Any ideas about what to do for West Virginia (outside of Droop 
Mountain, which has a letterbox), Maryland or Kentucky?  I've gotten more 
interested, since the actions of armed forces off a battlefield and the 
consequences has been replayed so often in modern wars.</font></div>

<div>Dave,</div>
<div>   Wonderful to here from you again! Hope you had a great 
Thanksgiving.</div>
<div>   I know there were a number of guerilla units, or 
"partisans" operating in various theaters of the war. I'm not sure 
specifically to the areas you mentioned, though I will try and find out. Turner 
Ashby and Mosby were the big ones here in Northern Va. (Loudoun County and 
Shenandoah County). I haave carve  stamps for both those officers. Ashby's 
Cavalry was the 7th Virginia Cavalry which was absorbed into the "Laurel 
Brigade" after he was killed in a firefight near Harrisonburg in 1862. He is 
buried in Winchester. I would like to do a stamp on Chew's Battery which was 
part of Ashby's unit. I am also hoping to do a stamp for the Mt. Zion Church 
(Mosby's meeting place) and Aldie Mill where a significant engagement was fought 
with Mosby's men.</div>
<div>   Any participation you want to do is fine. I am not able to get 
in West Virginia much other than occasionally going to Harper's Ferry, which is 
one of my favorite places. I will attach a WOM I have there in case you ever 
travel through. It's a tough one physically, but beautiful!</div>
<div>   Let me know what you would like to do. Safe trails.</div>
