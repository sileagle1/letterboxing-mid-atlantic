I found it! I found it! Another five year old letterbox with a <br/>
perfect log!<br/>
<br/>
I also found Aya The Fern 2/1/01 it also has a perfect log!<br/>
<br/>
Per his request I am attempting to contact the Jolly G Man to return <br/>
his logs. I'm offering to adopt and fully restore all the Jolly G <br/>
Man Letterboxes in AB Wildlife Refuge.<br/>
