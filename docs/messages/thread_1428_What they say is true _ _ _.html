                    <div id="ygrps-yiv-441224584">in CT you can trip over boxes at every corner, especially when seeking<br/>
Friends of Winsted -1, 2, &amp; 3 series.  Of the 53 boxes, 3 were missing<br/>
and two businesses had already closed for the holiday.  But 48 finds<br/>
were logged with Butterfly.  <br/>
<br/>
Hope everyone in the Mid-ATL has a great holiday and maybe a few finds!<br/>
