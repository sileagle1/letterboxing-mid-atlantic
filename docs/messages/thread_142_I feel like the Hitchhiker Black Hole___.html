on?<br/>
<br/>
There are about 7 now on Wanda and Pete's site that end with me, and <br/>
I've moved along every single one of them! I KNOW that some of them <br/>
must have been found, because I've heard reports that so-and-so found <br/>
xyz box last month, and I left abc HH in xyz box. <br/>
<br/>
Maybe people who find them just aren't posting that they've found <br/>
them? Am I the only one with this problem?<br/>

</span></blockquote>    I think that you may have hit that nail on the head. I really  <br/>
  don't know because I've never placed or found a HH but, I read  <br/>
  many, many posts on the main list (and others) before I began to <br/>
  contribute my opinion. It seems that various aspects of this <br/>
  question continually arise. People want to know about their MIA HH, <br/>
  their first finders prize, why did someone post a missing box to   <br/>
  the list but not contact the placer as well?<br/>
<br/>
    I posted a similar question not long ago. I wanted to know why <br/>
  placers weren't responding to my email regarding their missing, <br/>
  swamped, whatever boxes. I received several very useful <br/>
  replies.<br/>
<br/>
    There are a number of possible answers : people not posting at <br/>
  all, perhaps just contacting the placer, not posting  until they  <br/>
  have put the HH back out on the road, etc.<br/>
<br/>
    You did your part, and thats all that you can do.</div>
