<br/>
Star Wars Lego and I did some Tyler SP finishing today.  That way we <br/>
have more time to hang with the crew at the gathering next week.  At <br/>
a leisurely pace, we managed to find...<br/>
<br/>
Steely Dan by Team Sudden Turkey - Cool Stamp with a Red Tailed Hawk <br/>
hangin' nearby<br/>
The Elvii by Team Little Dog:<br/>
TCB -  A stamp after out heart!<br/>
Hound Dog - No more brambles (since August)<br/>
Blue Seude Shoes - Don't step on 'em.<br/>
Raindear's Cool Series:<br/>
Aerosmith in good shape - Excellent Carvings!<br/>
Bee Gees lying out in the open (rehid better)<br/>
Mystery Musician - out in the open, wet inside, ripped bags<br/>
                   Did repairs and hid him<br/>
Love Seed Mama Jump by Clueless - Very Floral Stamp, Cool SPOR<br/>
Pearl Jam Alive - Cool Dude - Awesome Album (will listen soon!)<br/>
<br/>
All in all a fun day, but we were a little disappointed that some of <br/>
Raindear's excellent creations were left out in the open (several <br/>
feet away from trees and such).  These may be party spots (I am <br/>
hoping) and the exposure was hopefully not due to careless boxers.  <br/>
Food for thought.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks to all of the carvers and placers.<br/>

in the open. From the condition of the out side<br/>
baggies i think it was critters.<br/>
