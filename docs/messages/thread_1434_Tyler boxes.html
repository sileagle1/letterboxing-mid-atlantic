<div>Hi LB,</div>
<div>Thanks for the maintenance help on my Tyler boxes.</div>
<div>Glad you enjoyed them.</div>
<div>Hope to see you and the gang one of these days.</div>

<div><em>Raindear's Cool Series:<br/>Aerosmith in good shape - Excellent Carvings!<br/>Bee Gees lying out in the open (rehid better)<br/>Mystery Musician - out in the open, wet inside, ripped bags<br/>                   Did repairs and hid him<br/>Love Seed Mama Jump by Clueless - Very Floral Stamp, Cool SPOR<br/>Pearl Jam Alive - Cool Dude - Awesome Album (will listen soon!)<br/><br/>All in all a fun day, but we were a little disappointed that some of <br/>Raindear's excellent creations were left out in the open (several <br/>feet away from trees and such).  These may be party spots (I am <br/>hoping) and the exposure was hopefully not due to careless boxers.  <br/>Food for thought.<br/><br/></em></div></html></div>
