Honestly, why do you people let me host these things? You know how I am!!!</div> <div> </div> <div>Anyhow. the gathering will be in the LOWER Plantation Picnic area. Enter off of Swamp Road, go through the stop sign and immediately make a right into the parking lot. The map kind of makes it look like it's to the left but if you look closer the picnic area is really to the right. I'll be the nut in the tie dye Gratfeul Dead shirt at one of the picnic tables. Please bring something to share. I'll have a camp stove or two and will probably do soup and a "Box of Joe" and donuts, plus a heater should we get too chilly. Or we can all just hug! Weather is supposed to be partly sunny mid-40's, perfect boxing weather! Bathrooms are a short drive (or long hike) down the hill to the boat launch area and will be open until dark.</div> <div> </div> <div>Folks, there are ton's of boxes there. I
 have two on Bucks County Community Colleges Campus, which runs along the park,  that I have to post by Friday. Print out all the of Battle of the Bands clues for Newtown. There is a Doctor Who, a Hop Devil and several other non-BOB boxes. The Muk-Schofield Ford Bridge box says it's pulled. Silent Doug says it's actually there but the area has changed so much it's tough to find. Several of us have searched in vain. Trails can get very muddy (especially near "The Police" box) so wear old shoes and clothes you don't mind getting dirty. </div> <div> </div> <div>I'm looking forward to seeing all my homies but am very excited about putting some new faces to some familiar names from the list!!!</div> <div> </div> <div>Also, if anyone is interested we will probably retire to Isaac Newtons for an early dinner after the gather. Great food and even better beer!</div> <div> </div> <div>So come to Newtown, Pa for one last big boxing blast before we all have to settle
 down and get ready for the holidays! Any questions please email me off list, thanks!!</div> <div> </div> <div> </div> <div> </div> <div> </div> <div> </div> <div><a href="http://www.weather.com/activities/other/other/weather/tenday-details.html?locid=USPA1187&amp;dayNum=4" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"></a> </div><p>
