<br/>
I'll be leaving NoVA mid-afternoon to drive up to Plainsboro NJ next <br/>
Tuesday.<br/>
<br/>
I will have a couple of hours of light on the way up, and until noon <br/>
Wednesday free for letterboxing.<br/>
<br/>
Then across PA to I-81 South.<br/>
<br/>
Have to be in VA by 5PM.<br/>
<br/>
Any advice on letterboxing possibilities?  All suggestions will be <br/>
considered!<br/>

A discussion of planted boxes in an area can't be taboo can it? On THIS list? Many of us post our finds here as it's great to keep everyone informed as to what boxes are out there and getting traffic. I love to read those posts and especially love when one of my boxes are in one! As long as no one is posting spoilers or mystery locations, what is the problem? Again, I am sure I am missing something so please excuse my ignorance. And if the answer is that this is not allowed...well I don't mean to sound fresh or be rude but then my question is....says who? We all plant our boxes to be found and unless they are mysteries or word of mouth clues I don't see the problem in answerig Nathan's question here. However, most of these types of discussions do occur off list. But listen folks, if any of you want to ever dicuss any one of my crappy little boxes online, go
 for it. I planted them for your enjoyment. Again, I know I must be missing something. I don't understand Marks intent here.<br/><br/><b><i>Mark Pepe &lt;mjpepe1@...&gt;</i></b> wrote:  <blockquote><span title="qreply"> <blockquote class="ygrps-yiv-692503093replbq" style="PADDING-LEFT:5px;MARGIN-LEFT:5px;BORDER-LEFT:#1010ff 2px solid;">  <div class="ygrps-yiv-692503093Section1"> <div class="ygrps-yiv-692503093MsoNormal"><font color="blue" face="Arial" size="2"><span style="FONT-SIZE:10pt;COLOR:blue;FONT-FAMILY:Arial;">And something that shouldnt even be discussed here!</span></font></div> <div class="ygrps-yiv-692503093MsoNormal"><font color="blue" face="Arial" size="2"><span style="FONT-SIZE:10pt;COLOR:blue;FONT-FAMILY:Arial;"></span></font> </div> <div class="ygrps-yiv-692503093MsoNormal"><font color="blue" face="Arial" size="2"><span style="FONT-SIZE:10pt;COLOR:blue;FONT-FAMILY:Arial;">Mark</span></font></div> <div class="ygrps-yiv-692503093MsoNormal" style="MARGIN-LEFT:0.5in;"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3"><span style="FONT-SIZE:12pt;"></span></font> </div></div><br/></blockquote><br/></span></blockquote></div><p>

<div>Irene:</div>
<div> </div>
<div>I meant no disrespect when answering that. Your boxes and everyone elses' are their own and free to share and spread the word as the creator sees fit. I'm not talking about those type of clues. I think Bulldawg was referring to a very special WOM clue that Koyote has which I sent to him shortly after he moved there. I can't go into the reasons but suffice it to say that the creator has asked it not be talked about in any public forum. I hope you understand. If you don't, please email me directly and we can discuss it. If I guessed wrong, I apologize.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>I'm sure you all would want to honor the wishes of a WOM clue. It's the creator's discretion as to how best to disseminate those clues. I like to spread our clues around, as many of you do. This one is not that way.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Hoping I'm not digging a bigger hole for myself here! If anyone wants to discuss this further, do not hesitate to email me directly.</div>

<div>Hello all,</div>
<div>  Thought I better weigh in here. You are all wrong. I have contacted 
Cyclonic OFF list regarding his trip. The boxes Bulldawg is referring to are 
personal WOMs that I PLANTED. As I respect the wishes of other WOMs in 
my posession, I would request the same of mine. My WOMs are increasing and 
will continue to do so because I am increasingly partial to that aspect of 
boxing. I like traffic a my boxes as much as the next boxr. I, however, have a 
fair number of boxes that I want to keep traffic at a minimum.</div>

I was looking at the list and was just wondering if the locals could <br/>
point me to some of the better boxes.  I have printed out all of the <br/>
drive-bys along my trek, but was looking for one or two decent hikes <br/>
that would result in a nice box (you know, hand carved stamp, pretty <br/>
views, nice forest, ect.).<br/>

<div>I never thought you meant WOM. Never occurred to me. I just thought the same thing you thought. Public list, somebody asking about boxes in that area like people always do. You told him someone who might help. And that someone wouldn't post his own WOM clues anyway.  I think Mark kind of got a tad over excitied there, the hit send finger was faster than the brain. I think we have all done that. Except me of course. BAHAHAHAAA! HOHOHOHO......HO</div>
