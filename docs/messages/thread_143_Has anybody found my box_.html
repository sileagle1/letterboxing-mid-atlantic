button?) that Physiography 101 might be missing, and that the area <br/>
looks well-searched. Before I go carving and climbing, can anyone <br/>
else give any further info on this? Should the clue be tweaked to <br/>
move the box a bit?<br/>
BTW, I am, in general, not a big fan of status reports on a list, <br/>
prefering to check the box in person. But if it went missing AFTER <br/>
you found it, this would be my only way of knowing of your success.<br/>
