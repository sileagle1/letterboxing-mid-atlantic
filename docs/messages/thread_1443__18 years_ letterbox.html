<div>I don't think you should retire it just because it freaks some people out.  It looks like it's a really interesting box. The hobby needs more unique ones, as opposed to cute and mundane. Nothing against cute and mundane, before anybody gets in an uproar, but......there's cute and then there's........different. </div>
