                    <div id="ygrps-yiv-1931579838">I'd just finished logging in to a "WOM" LBox when I noticed that I <br/>
was being watched. There was a young gentleman nonchalantly "looking <br/>
at the trees" strolling on the main trail maybe forty yards from me. <br/>
He was way too close for me to try to replace the box I was holding. <br/>
I practice discreet letterboxing, so I had the box twenty or thirty <br/>
yards away from the hollow stump hiding spot.<br/>
<br/>
"No big deal" I thought and I waited for the gentlemen to move on. <br/>
However he appeared to be waiting to see exactly what I was doing.<br/>
<br/>
There is a beautiful river view another ten minutes down the trail <br/>
but there was absolutely nothing of interest within 100 yards of <br/>
where we were and I was far enough off the trail that I did think <br/>
any reasonable person would pay attention to me. But this guy was <br/>
obviously checking me out as he was doing a very poor job disguising <br/>
it. There was a nearby normal letterbox but he wasn't moving toward <br/>
it and I did not see a backpack/fannypack or any place for a log, <br/>
inkpad and stamp.<br/>
<br/>
I thought maybe this was the mysterious Bulldawg whom I never met... <br/>
but he made no gesture or signal I recognized as a Letterboxer <br/>
trying to communicate. So I just decided to "wait him out". I stayed <br/>
put while the man feigned interest in the bare empty tree tops.<br/>
<br/>
In a Mexican Stand off neither of us moved for several minutes which <br/>
seemed like hours. I stood still and faced him. He made no move and <br/>
contiued to gaze up at the trees like there was something of <br/>
interest (but there was not).<br/>
<br/>
Finally, seeing that I was not moving... nor pretending to do <br/>
anything, not making an attempt to visit, the gentleman then left <br/>
the trail and came over to me. Making small talk he mentioned the <br/>
cold weather.(Why are you walking over here? I thoight) It then <br/>
occurred to me this person was not Bulldawg, not any Letterboxer. It <br/>
suddenly seemed so very odd for him to be approaching me off the <br/>
trail. Is this guy going to pull a gun and rob me? Mentally I <br/>
practiced using my hiking pole as a sword.<br/>
<br/>
He moved toward my right. I turned to face him keeping him directly <br/>
in front of me. I asked "Are you waiting for me?"  He said no and <br/>
stopped advancing... and slowly moved away, but continued watching.<br/>
<br/>
I still dont know if this was Bulldawg a cop or a robber... but I <br/>
left the area with the box in my pack, doubling back 30 minutes <br/>
later to replace the box. By now the man was gone<br/>
<br/>
If this was Bulldawg... I'm sorry we did figure out who each other <br/>
was... if it wasn't Bulldawg... this was downright creepy!</div>
