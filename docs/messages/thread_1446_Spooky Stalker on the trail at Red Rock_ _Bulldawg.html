<div>  Freaky story, GR, and more so when I tell you that it was, in fact,

We are in training for the upcoming Pub Crawl. Prior to the game; I was 
speaking with him at his house. I'm afraid you just had some weirdo checkin' you 
out. Or a boxer not sure of how to make contact.</div>
<div>   As far as being careful in "that neck of the woods"; we all 
need to be careful whenever we are out hiking in any area. I have been to Red 
Rock many times, and have never had, or heard of a problem. That is a very high 
traffic park as it is so close to neighborhoods. I always look at it from 
another point... It's the boxer that looks suspicious. We are the ones 
poking around stumps, rocks, or whatever, and off trail at times. The same with 
more remote areas. I was out planting a box at...well, at a place where 
"controlled hunting" is practiced. Hunting was clearly not allowed at the time I 
was on trail. I still covered my pack with blaze orange and glad I did. The 
sound of very close gunfire made it obvious someone was not concerned with 
particular times to hunt. SAFE TRAILS.</div>

University Rugby Team in 1983... but that was over twenty years and <br/>
I wasn't relishing the idea of fisticuffs in the woods with a <br/>
younger man.... about five years ago in a New Orleans alley  I had a <br/>
gun put to my head and was releived of my cash... I was having <br/>
flashbacks of that "ooky" feeling....  If this Red Rock person was <br/>
sizing me up for a robbery I think the fact that I kept facing him <br/>
and wouldn't let him flank me made him reconsider... that and the <br/>
fact that I'm fifty pounds larger and carry a stick.... I shudder to <br/>
think if this was a lone female letterboxer... <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
All this being said... I love to meet nice people on the trail... <br/>
letterboxers or muggles... I try to be freindly...<br/>
<br/>
This was just really odd and I'm still a little freaked.<br/>
<br/>
AFTER this happened I went after "18 Years" Mystery Box.... which is <br/>
FREAKY Ness of another nature!!!!<br/>

Actually, this happened to me this summer. Some of you might have seen <br/>
the post about it on Mark Pepe's site. I actually was geocaching in an <br/>
area less than a mile from my house...and bordering a busy <br/>
neighborhood. As I was logging in, a man came up behind me and <br/>
was "pleasuring himself." When I attempted to leave, he blocked the <br/>
path, wouldn't allow me to leave and rubbed himself on me. I got away <br/>
and they caught him based on my description of him and a license plate <br/>
on a truck parked by the trail head. A passerby found me blubbering by <br/>
the side of the road and called the police.<br/>
<br/>
The worst thing was, he was a repeat sexual offender who didn't even <br/>
live anywhere near there. He asked for a trial and got one, thinking I <br/>
would back out, but I called his bluff and agreed to testify. He ended <br/>
up pleading guilty to the Public Lewdness charge with a one year <br/>
probation and the sexual assault charge was dropped. I have a one year <br/>
restraining order against him. Although I don't know him, I don't want <br/>
to take any chances.<br/>
<br/>
For two weeks, I wouldn't leave the house. I was so creeped out. I <br/>
finally ventured forth again, but I am now armed and ALWAYS aware of my <br/>
surroundings. If I had seen your creepy guy, and he hadn't moved away <br/>
but approached instead,  I would have shouted at him like a crazy <br/>
person and got the hell out of there.<br/>
<br/>
Just thought I should warn any of you who might approach me mid-trail <br/>
for an exchange. *grin*<br/>
