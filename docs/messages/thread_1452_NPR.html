<div>I would never do that. </div>

<div>Thanks for respecting my right to express myself. I'm not going to argue with you about it. I made myself pretty clear and if we "mix it up", some people (not all-but some) will say I am atttacking you personally and I wasn't doing that. You're being very gacious about it. I'm an emotional person and there are some things I just feel really strongly about. I finally find a really cool hobby that I think I might actually like to do the rest of my life and I think that it will be ruined someday by publicity. That's all. </div>
