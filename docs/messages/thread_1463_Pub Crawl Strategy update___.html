I'm sending this to you personal email box and not posting this to the <br/>
LBMA forum on Yahoo because I want to catch everybody else off guard. <br/>
Judy and I are going to Leesburg Virginia today ostensibly to meet <br/>
with Koyote to discuss the Civil War (War of Northern Aggression!) <br/>
Letterbox Series he is developing but actually we are on a <br/>
reconnaissance mission to identify and map the possible Letterbox <br/>
placement locations Poison Ivy will be using for the Leesburg <br/>
Letterbox Pub Crawl next month! Shhh! Keep it our secret. Our team is <br/>
sure to win!<br/>
