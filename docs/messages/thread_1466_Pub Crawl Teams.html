formed at the event.<br/>
<br/>
Do not worry if you are attending solo.<br/>
I'm sure you can easily be welcomed into a team of new friends.<br/>
<br/>
The number of folks in the team is not a hard and fast rule. I just <br/>
wanted to make sure that no one was wandering the streets alone and <br/>
we didn't have a pack of 20 entering an establishment en masse.<br/>
<br/>
There's just under 5 weeks to the event. <br/>
Use the holiday parties wisely to begin your 'training.'<br/>
<br/>
Koyote may be well ahead of all of you.<br/>

(AND, I have three dogs myself, but I'm really a cat person.)<br/>
