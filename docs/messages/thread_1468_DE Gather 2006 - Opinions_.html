gather at Killens Pond State Park, Kent County DE.<br/>
<br/>
Seems, I cannot reserve one of the three pavilions until Jan 3  <br/>
and "walk-ins" are handled first.   She said they have been known to <br/>
line up at 4AM, and the office opens at 7AM this one day of the year <br/>
to handle the rush.<br/>
<br/>
My dilemma  is I live in VA - 3hrs drive - and the summer house has <br/>
been winterized so I can't stay there.<br/>
<br/>
So I am seeking alternate dates for a gather called "It's Just a <br/>
Game" that would be best handled if folks can box on Sat and come to <br/>
the gather on Sun.  Details are drafted and a web site will go up <br/>
AFTER I get a pavilion booked.<br/>
<br/>
FIRST CHOICE is Sun Oct 8 (Mon is a fed holiday) (Full Moon)<br/>
SECOND is Sun Sept 3 (Mon is Labor day)  availability highly unlikely<br/>
THIRD is Sun Sept 10 (Full Moon)<br/>
<br/>
I was trying to schedule it for after the summer crowds and under a <br/>
full moon for those nite boxers.<br/>
<br/>
Would  Sun Nov 5 (Full Moon) be too late in the year - especially for <br/>
anyone wanting to camp there?<br/>
<br/>
Is there anyone in DE who would like to be my representative to go to <br/>
Killens Pond at 7AM on Jan 3rd?<br/>
email me off list for further discussion (sowbiz @ yahoo . com)<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for your input - I hope I can get the pavilion booked.<br/>

</span></blockquote>I can't help you with making the reservations (but this must be some<br/>
park if people line up for them), I can just tell you my prefrence.<br/>
<br/>
Personally, I would prefer Sept 10.  Memorial Day weekend may make for a<br/>
very busy park, not real condusive for letterboxing.  October 8 is Phun<br/>
Phest (one of those coaster things), so I won't be able to go.<br/>
<br/>
Some may find Nov 5 too late, weather is real iffy, but you may luck out<br/>
(that weekend this year was very nice).<br/>
