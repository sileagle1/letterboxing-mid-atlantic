Album area. The more senior Letterboxers from around the country will <br/>
remember this trail name from several years ago. The Jolly G Man (now <br/>
retired) was one of the original Letterboxers in the US. He placed 63 <br/>
letterboxes in nine different states. I am adopting and restoring five <br/>
of his boxes here in Northern Virginia. I'm returning the original <br/>
logs to Jolly G Man but before I do I will scan the log cover and <br/>
stamp images.</div>

Jolly-G-Man years ago, and abandonded by the placer..Both boxes had no <br/>
visitor in over a year, and one was aprox 22 months or so, if i <br/>
recall.  The hike was breathtaking, with 1/3 or so along the Potomac <br/>
River/ Great Falls Gorge...where you are right on the edge of cliffs <br/>
and awesome rock formations overlooking the river below..Impressive <br/>
stuff....<br/>
<br/>
I had emailed the Jolly-G-man before our trek, and he mentioned not <br/>
wanting them any more, and to adopt them..Thus that is what I will do. <br/>
We pulled his old full books, to send to him..and need to go back and <br/>
add a new book to "dream"<br/>
<br/>
Great fun w/ the Koyote, even though he was determined to break an <br/>
ankle of the way back.<br/>

<div>To echo Bulldawg; we had a great time on one of our canine capers to find 
some long lost Jolly G-man boxes. What spectacular views!! My ankles should 
recover from the rough terrain in a day or so.... or possibly after the first 
couple of glasses of "cheer" tomorrow. :) </div>
<div>  Also went boxing later in the day for Bulldawg and Shell's "Rudolph" 
series with DJ2A (sister-in-law and kids). Wonderful series! 9 boxes 
today....sweet! Safe trails!</div>
