are unofficial and not required... and for the most part they will <br/>

early ... there will be many people putting faces with names the first <br/>
time... <br/>

<div>Ken,</div>
<div>   Welcome to the group! Saw your box posted, but have not had 
the pleasure yet. The Crawl should be a great time and give you a chance to meet 
fellow boxers and new friends. I'll look forward to exchanging with you! Safe 
trails!</div>

<br/>
I could've sworn I sent you a note about joining a team.<br/>
And now I can't find it. <br/>
Perhaps I've been training for the Pub Crawl too much.<br/>
<br/>
Anyhoo, the other responses are true and correct, <br/>
-the number in a team is not intended for strict adherance<br/>
-the team idea is to keep you from traveling the streets alone<br/>
-it's also intended to moderate the number of pedestrians at any one <br/>
bar at one time.<br/>
-many teams will be formed out of newly met friends and the ones and <br/>
twos that come along. Worry not!<br/>
<br/>
Three weeks from Saturday! (I'd better get carving.)<br/>
