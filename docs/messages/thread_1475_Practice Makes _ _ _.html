                    <div id="ygrps-yiv-298725294">. . . me sleepy . . . or maybe it was that big steak lunch.  But had <br/>
an interesting ale (Krosch sp?) in Old Town Alex that tasted like a <br/>
campfire/burning wood with an after taste of rice! <br/>
<br/>
GR and I found Company Picnic and Here Comes the Son, but no luck with <br/>
Woodstock Wilderness and Mt Vernon Trail Fort Hunt LB is definitely <br/>
gone -- although the location was historically interesting.<br/>
<br/>
I guess there are still a few more days for LB'g before the year runs <br/>
out.  But not before Xmas -- so here is wishing everyone gets a <br/>
stocking full of carving materials and the occasional sweet.<br/>
