<br/>
Our Michael's has carving supplies near calligraphy and paper<br/>
supplies, not with rubber stamps and ink pads.  They also sell<br/>
different kinds of carving material, the Speedball white-ish stuff is<br/>
crumbly and worthless (sorry if you already know this - just want to<br/>
give warning), and the pink stuff I hear is nice to carve.<br/>
<br/>
Online MisterArt.com sells MasterCarve, both thick and thin, here's<br/>
the link:<br/>

you may need to cut and paste if the link is split over 2 lines.<br/>

Hope this is helpful,<br/>
