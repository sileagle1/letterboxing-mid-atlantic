<br/>
We did this series yesterday and greatly enjoyed the whole package: <br/>
grounds, factory (no one was working but still neat to see the <br/>
layout), displays, clues, logbook, etc.  We had to leave the last one <br/>
as the security company arrived as we were poking around in the woods <br/>
and carefully observed us until we got back into our car.  Oh well! <br/>
<br/>
We also did the following while we were in the neighborhood:<br/>
Let Freedom Ring<br/>
The Lame-O Loam Foam Lone Star Letterbox<br/>
Keith House<br/>
Ghostly Gathering (2 of 3; we could not find #1)<br/>
Dr Who #6<br/>
Ghost of Graeme Park<br/>
<br/>
All in all, a great day letterboxing, even if the mud at Graeme Park <br/>
was fearsome.<br/>
