I had my first plant of the year late this afternoon.  It will be on <br/>
letterboxing.org soon.  It is called "Spirit of St. Louis."<br/>
<br/>
I was hoping to have our first hairy legged find of the year tomorrow <br/>
with the hairest bunch yet, but it looks doubtful because of bad <br/>
weather forecast for most of the day tomorrow.  Playing it by ear.<br/>

course all the sites required use of one.  B's were quite disappointed <br/>

It drives me crazy that I was unable to get to your Chalfont boxes <br/>
before the new year turned.  Between weather, work, and general <br/>
scheduling issues, it just wasn't able to happen.  SIGH, SIGH, SIGH!<br/>
<br/>
What will you do with them now?  Retire them?<br/>

Subject: [lbma] First Plant for 2006<br/>
<br/>
Cool.<br/>
<br/>
I had my first plant of the year late this afternoon.  It will be on<br/>
letterboxing.org soon.  It is called "Spirit of St. Louis."<br/>
<br/>
I was hoping to have our first hairy legged find of the year tomorrow<br/>
with the hairest bunch yet, but it looks doubtful because of bad<br/>
weather forecast for most of the day tomorrow.  Playing it by ear.<br/>

&gt; Warcat76 found our 1st 2006 box today- "Let Freedom Ring".  Also<br/>
found "Lame-o Loam..."- both in Horsham, PA.<br/>
&gt;   We picked up our "Songs of the Seasons" boxes and were happy to<br/>
see so many people found them.  Lots of people from out-of state too.<br/>
&gt;   Happy Letterboxing to all in 2006.<br/>
