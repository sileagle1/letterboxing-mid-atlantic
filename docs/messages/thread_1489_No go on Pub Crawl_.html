                    <div id="ygrps-yiv-1414576272">well...with a busy time at work, it seems as if we have moved up <br/>
our "re-location" trip to South Carolina one week.....Thus making it <br/>
the weekend of the crawl! I am gonna have to canel, unless anything <br/>
else come up, but that is unlikely.<br/>
<br/>
bummer, but let me know how it goes, and your opinion on my event <br/>
stamp!<br/>
<br/>
I still might try and get a few mystery stamps out by then for the <br/>
hell of it.....<br/>

Peace!</div>

Carolina...dont know much about it though, or ifs gonna really <br/>
happen.<br/>
And yes i would take my ideas there and continue!<br/>
<br/>
As for being Koyote's "alter ego"...anything is possible, and <br/>
mysteries make life better.....but i assure you, are carvings are <br/>
completely different, w/ different tools..and I am by far the more <br/>
handsome of the 2..he has multiple personalities, but I dont think <br/>
he has one named "BullDawg" yet<br/>
<br/>
believe as you like, anything is possible<br/>
