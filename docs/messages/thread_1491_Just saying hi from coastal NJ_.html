started by taking the kids to look for Mosquito Madness and found it<br/>
just as the sun was dropping below the horizon. I sent the kids back<br/>
down the trail while I finished stamping in and replacing the box, but<br/>
we ended up driving out of the park after dark anyway. The warning is<br/>
correct, by the way. It was the end of december and we still saw<br/>
mosquitos (albeit very sluggish ones). <br/>
<br/>
We followed this up with Terra-cotta Tangram a couple days later. Lots<br/>
of fun and a fascinating site.<br/>
<br/>
We used some store-bought stamps that we had on hand to get started<br/>
and still need to make our own. Does anyone have any suggestions as to<br/>
what type of material is best?<br/>
<br/>
I think we are on our way to being addicted even though we are just<br/>
starting. We are travelling to visit family in PA and northern NJ this<br/>
weekend and already trying to figure out how to fit in a letterbox<br/>
search between family obligations. We have also started planning<br/>
locations to plant our own boxes.<br/>
<br/>
Looking forward to more fun searches,<br/>

Check out www.stampeaz.com for PZ Kut.  I've used the ORANGE Grade "A" <br/>
and it worked a charm.  And it is much less expensive than "pink <br/>
stuff" so starting out you can afford to make more carving mistakes.  <br/>
<br/>
But if you can't find the "pink stuff" at Michaels (craft store)then <br/>
go to www.pearlpaint.com - they have stores in Paramus and <br/>
Woodbridge.  They don't carry the "pink stuff" on their web site.<br/>
<br/>
I also recommend an Xacto XPL5204 Stencil Knife.  http://www.x-<br/>
actoblades.com/xacto/xpage4.htm  for a picture.  I've bought at Total <br/>
Crafts - but I'm sure any local craft/hobby store could/should <br/>
order/carry them.<br/>
<br/>
Hope to meet you at a gather - have you checked out www.atlasquest.com?<br/>

you choose to describe it!  We are also in central NJ near the 195 <br/>
corridor.  Lots of great boxes around here.<br/>
<br/>
We use the speedball carving set from Michael's craft store. A great <br/>
starting medium for us was erasers from the dollar store -- regular <br/>
size and those "Big Mistake" joke ones.  Esp. with kids and the <br/>
resulting level of enthusiam.  I turned them loose on those and didn't <br/>
worry about the cost as they spent an afternoon carving away.  They <br/>
have changed their signature stamps several times as a result of their <br/>
efforts and are just about ready to change them again...<br/>
