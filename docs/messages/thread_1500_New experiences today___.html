Letterbox"..and had a few new experiences.<br/>
<br/>
during the hike, I came across a deer sleeping, on the edge of the <br/>
trail..When i got with-in 5 feet, it jumped up, and took off...we were <br/>
both startled, then i continue on, find the letterbox, which is a <br/>
LARGE coffee can, painted by girl scouts. I open it up, and there is a <br/>
log book, but no stamp...and i was the first finder<br/>
<br/>
I am contacting them, but not sure how serious the girl scout troop <br/>
will be to follow up and add a stamp...If not, ill carve something for <br/>
it!<br/>

                    <div id="ygrps-yiv-1451010308">I love it when I encounter wildlife while hiking. I walked up on a <br/>
dozen deer at Accotink Bay last Monday... somehow they didn't notice <br/>
me (or I them) until I was practically among them. <br/>
<br/>
I've seen Bald Eagles up close many times but it remains a thrill. <br/>
When I was a little Gallant Rogue... Eagles were very nearly extinct <br/>
and they drilled that into my head in gtade school. Well today the <br/>
Bald Eagle is thriving in Northern Virginia along the Potomac River. <br/>
