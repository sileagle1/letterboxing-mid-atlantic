be in either a ghost town or a party town. Every bar will have every <br/>
TV tuned to the game. Even non football fans will be interested <br/>
because of the Joe Gibbs hysteria  casual Redskins boosters will <br/>
become fanatical. Fanaticals will be rabid die hards. Rabid die <br/>
hards will be maniacal!<br/>
<br/>
Some bars will be FULL some will be EMPTY.... if the Redskins are <br/>
winning it will be jubilation like Mardis Gras... and if they are not <br/>
winning... it will be subdued.<br/>
<br/>
I'll have a head set listening to play by play... then be checking out <br/>
the game at every TV.... I'm a rabid fan all year long... so if the <br/>
Redskins are winning it will be a wonderfull rolling party.... and if <br/>
they are not winning.... I will be soooo glad I'm Letterboxing thru <br/>
old English Pubs. Either way I think it will be a night to remember!</div>
