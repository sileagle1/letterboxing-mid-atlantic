I made a (relatively) dry run in Leesburg to get the lay of the land. <br/>
While we don't need much practice bending elbows, we did discover that <br/>
we may need supplemental oxygen...we come from Montgomery County, MD, <br/>
land of smoke-free restaurants.<br/>
<br/>
Now, a public service announcement about vultures:<br/>
<br/>
We had just enough time to search for one Leesburg letterbox. This was <br/>
in a great old cemetery, which interestingly was home to dozens of <br/>
roosting vultures. If you must search for letterboxes in the vicinity <br/>
of vultures, bring disposable shoe covers. The vile creatures puke up <br/>
pellets of undigested matter and it stinks just like you would imagine <br/>
vulture vomit to. Given the number of birds in this cemetery, there <br/>
was no avoiding the stuff. It wasn't a pleasant ride home.<br/>

</span></blockquote>"Vulture Vomit!" Sounds like a great name for a letterbox!<br/>
