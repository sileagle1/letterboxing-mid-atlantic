<br/>
The Knights of Columbus meeting for Virginia, brought me to Richmond <br/>
over the weekend.  Good meeting, as these things go.  I stayed the <br/>
night at the Holiday Inn Select nearby, and spent the evening <br/>
researching more letterboxes than I had already planned for Sunday.<br/>
<br/>
Status:<br/>
<br/>
Huguenot Park  (0 for 3)<br/>
Struck out looking for the Huguenot Cross, Huguenot Knot and <br/>
Huguenot Dove.  My handwritten notes were no match for the <br/>
numerous "T" and "Y" intersections in the park.  Will try again over <br/>
the summer with printed copies of the clues.  Nice park though, <br/>
right next to the hotel.  Wonderful playground for kids on it.<br/>
<br/>
Robious Landing Park  (5 for 7)<br/>
This is right on the James River, and it is a nice park.  Tons of <br/>
folks out walking their dogs.<br/>
<br/>
Robious Landing Park LB--needs new logbook.  Existing one is <br/>
stuffed, and folks are stamping in on a sheet of paper in the <br/>
letterbox.  Replaced 2 split ziplocks, otherwise in good shape.<br/>
<br/>
Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone:  The Castle--new baggie for <br/>
the inkpad.  Picked up Celtic Quinn's "Mario's Mushrooms:  The 1Up <br/>
Mushroom HH".<br/>
<br/>
Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone:  Sorting Hat--the location <br/>
for this one is pretty clear--but no letterbox.<br/>
<br/>
Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone:  Snitch--spent a lot of time <br/>
looking for this one.  Couldn't find a tree with the right knots.  <br/>
Maybe my handwritten notes again?  No box.<br/>
<br/>
Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone:  Fluffy--found, and in good <br/>
shape.  After confirming this one, used the clues to go back for <br/>
Snitch again.  Still no luck.<br/>
<br/>
Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone:  Wizards Chess--new bag for <br/>
the inkpad.  Pad should be removed, it's making a real mess.  <br/>
Logbook and stamp in good shape though.<br/>
<br/>
Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone:  Sorcerer's Stone--tricky, <br/>
but found it as I was throwing in the towel.  In good shape, and a <br/>
perfect spot.<br/>
<br/>
Deep Run Park  (6 for 7)<br/>
Wow, what a park.  For a country fellow who thinks a baseball <br/>
diamond and a place for the kids to play is a park, this was <br/>
something.  Fountains, nature center, trails, trails, trails.<br/>
<br/>
Food Fight #1, #2, #3 and #4--all in good shape, and a great walk.  <br/>
Replaced a baggie on #1, and the stump is about shot.  Might need to <br/>
move it soon.  Otherwise, it's a neat 3 year old series.<br/>
<br/>
Donovan's Travels--spent too much time looking for this one, without <br/>
success.  Knights of Columbo found it a couple of weeks earlier, so <br/>
I know it's there somewhere.  I knew it was time to move on when <br/>
organizing all the fallen pines into a pile started to seem like a <br/>
viable option.<br/>
<br/>
Dan the Man's Cool Boxes:  Underneath the Tree with White Marks--<br/>
somehow  I thought looking for this one after Donovan's would get me <br/>
back on track--it seemed easy enough.  I found it, but only after <br/>
circling 187 trees--it must have looked like a madman.  My apologies <br/>
to all the moms with small kids who were terrified of the big man <br/>
muttering to himself on the playground. It could use new bags, but I <br/>
was out.<br/>
<br/>
Dan the Man's Cool Boxes:  Triple Rocks Box--yep, it's there.  All <br/>
is well, and might be the smallest stamp image I've found.<br/>
<br/>
There are a lot more boxes in this park, but they will have to wait <br/>
for my next Richmond trip in June.<br/>
<br/>
11 for 17 attempted, or 12 for 18 (67%) if you count the hitchhiker.<br/>
<br/>
Richmond is lucky to have these great parks available.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks,<br/>

We also had trouble with the Snitch, but fortunately(?), the placers <br/>
were there when we were hunting and were so excited that we were there <br/>
they kept stalking us to be sure we found 'em all! <br/>
With that in mind, I can give you some pointers if you wish (since they <br/>
obviously didn't mind!) to help when you return.<br/>
