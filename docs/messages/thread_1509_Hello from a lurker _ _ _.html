<br/>
I've been lurking for a while and thought I'd pop up to say hello. <br/>
It's been a long time since I posted. Hi there to everyone I've met <br/>
before and welcome and hello to the newer members!<br/>
<br/>
Irene, we were sorry to miss the t-shirt gather at the last minute <br/>
because I was ill. Gwenllian was unhappy, as she had made plans to <br/>
meet up with NJCarole's son, Luckywolf. We sure had been looking <br/>
forward to it! The latest gatherings and the upcoming pubcrawl sound <br/>
so creative and fun - it's really a shame we have to miss them. <br/>
<br/>
The baby is getting ready to toddle any second now - and my <br/>
letterboxing activities have been severely hampered by her nap <br/>
schedule. I did find time today to get out and check on Saddler's <br/>
Legacy. It was dry as a bone and perfectly hidden, but has only had <br/>
one visit since early fall. If this spring-like weather keeps up, I <br/>
may even get out again to plant a four box series that has been <br/>
ready to go in my pack since JUNE!! <br/>
<br/>
Well, enough of my rambling . . . I sure do enjoy following along <br/>
with the conversations on this board - looking forward to meeting up <br/>
with ya'll one of these days!<br/>
