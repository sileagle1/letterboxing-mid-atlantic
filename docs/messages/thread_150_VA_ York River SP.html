posted as closed. From the state park website:<br/>
<br/>
"Taskinas Creek Trail remains closed because of damage caused last year by<br/>
Hurricane Isabel. It's likely to remain closed for the rest of 2004 as the<br/>
trail suffered extensive bridge and boardwalk damage."<br/>
<br/>
That affects Taskinas Creek and Cardinals Rule.<br/>
<br/>
The Mattaponi Trail was just reopened in the last couple of weeks. The last<br/>
time I looked for an update, it was on the closed list for a damaged<br/>
boardwalk. Apparently, that's now fixed. Mattaponi Trail LB was plundered<br/>
long before the storm and never replaced, although it would be amusing to<br/>
know if the tree itself (big one on the edge of the bluff overlooking the<br/>
river) survived the storm. LadyBug's Pupa was there right before the storm.<br/>
You'll likely be the first letterboxer to get back there to see if it still<br/>
there. One good note is that a geocache in that general area has already<br/>
been found to have survived the storm, so unless a tree fell on the<br/>
letterbox itself, it should still be there. The same should apply to Fossil.<br/>
<br/>
The park itself was completely closed from the storm until March 1. They had<br/>
a lot of fallen trees that needed to be cleaned. Be ready for anything.<br/>

&gt;<br/>
&gt; We're planning on heading up and hitting the Hampton ones too...Anyone<br/>
know<br/>
&gt; if the York River River boxes survived Isabelle? Heard the park was<br/>
&gt; devastated. Kerri<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;   I hadn't thought about it.  Maybe we'll head down to the beach and<br/>
&gt;   get the ones in the Norfolk/Hampton area.<br/>
