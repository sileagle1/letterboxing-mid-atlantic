<p>The Clue series is Really cool.  I finished it (missed Mrs. White and couldn't find the rope)  But Loved the series.  I wish I'd taken my Mt. Bike down there to find the people with. Then again I have a friend who hasn't done the People or the weapons and it I could always go with her and take my bike :^)<br/><br/></p></div>

<div></div>&gt;Hi, 
<div></div>&gt;I'm a new member here, and only done a couple letterboxes so far. I really like it and take my 6 yr old daughter along usually. She has a kickin stamp.

<p>The Clue series is Really cool.  I finished it (missed Mrs. White and couldn't find the rope)  But Loved the series.  I wish I'd taken my Mt. Bike down there to find the people with.

<div></div>&gt;Hi, 
<div></div>&gt;I'm a new member here, and only done a couple letterboxes so far. I really like it and take my 6 yr old daughter along usually. She has a kickin stamp. I am in Richmond and did vote on the poll. There seems to be a lot in the Richmond area. There is a series based on the game Clue that is very extensive, I just started. I found my first hitchhiker this weekend. I am a novice but willing to help with co-ordinating a gathering here.
