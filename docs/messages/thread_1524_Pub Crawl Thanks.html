Poison Ivy really had this all put together well. It was great to see <br/>
old and new friends... I remember talking with most of you. It was sooo <br/>
funny to have the bartenders trying to give us hints to some of the <br/>
boxes. Nice to see they were having fun with it too!<br/>
  Nice to see TGD down this way! Geckospot was great keeping track of <br/>
our team's scavenger points. Nice to meet WINK and the rest of the clan <br/>
from Oz.<br/>
    OK... time for Tylenol and coffee. Safe trails to all!<br/>
