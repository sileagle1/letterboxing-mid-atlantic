<br/>
Hugs and kisses to Poison Ivy for staging and hosting such a unique <br/>
gather. Dead Duck Chuck and I had a great "date night" cruising the <br/>
Leesburg bars. It was amusing being the sober driver and watching my <br/>
partner become progressively wasted...I always forget my camera. Most <br/>
of the establishments seemed pleased to be involved and the bartenders <br/>
were a big help in finding items for the scavenger hunt. We missed <br/>
Scarab and Nightowl (the other half of "Team Relentless"), but were <br/>
happy to see them when they dropped by at the finish line late in the <br/>
evening. It was great seeing old friends and meeting new ones. I hope <br/>
we see more of you all!<br/>
<br/>
Thanks again, PI!<br/>
