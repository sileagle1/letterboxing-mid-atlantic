I know I say this after every gather, but I really can't remember when I've had more fun! And Sowsewbizzy and I, along with the rest of the Brew Hounds, kept our second place streak in tact! (We were second place in the Road Rally). I was just blown away by PI's brochure, the time he took to research the trivia, talk up the event to the bars and make the whole thing happen. What a Herculean effort it must have been! Thank you so much! And PI was the first to thank Yuri Nahl for his help so here's a big shout out to him as well. And to the carvers and my great team of hounds. It was a blast to meet some new faces and see lot's of old friends. To quote Commander Cody and His Lost Planet Airmen "There's a whole lotta things that I ain't done, I ain't ever had too much fun." But boy do I come damn close sometimes. Last night was one of them.

the biker bar, what was the name of the band? Many<br/>
