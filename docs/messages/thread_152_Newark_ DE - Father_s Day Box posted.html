<br/>
Well, my family made me a letterbox for Father's Day.  I just had to <br/>
rush out and place it.<br/>
<br/>
We went to Lum's Pond State Park in Delaware and walked the lifetime <br/>
fitness course.  Nice place.<br/>
<br/>
BTW, was there someone who was at Lum's Pond on Father's day in Area <br/>
4?  We passed an SUV with a LbNA sticker in the back window.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks!<br/>
