it's bad manners to RSVP and bag, and also sorry for purely selfish <br/>
reasons - it looks like it was a BLAST! Spidey and I were SOOOO <br/>
excited to go, but apparently the fates were firmly aligned against <br/>
us - as proof, witness our evening...And I am not kidding about ANY <br/>
of this....!<br/>
<br/>
First, Spidey had to work late, but he tore home and i jumped into <br/>
the car while it was still rolling trying to make the 5pm start. We <br/>
were tearing westward, and things were going southward - This is when <br/>
the gailforce winds and hail started. We have a little sporty thing <br/>
that apparently isn't especially aerodynamic from the sides - who <br/>
knew? Undetered, Spidey fought valiantly to keep the car on at least <br/>
one of the lanes on 7 - he was doing pretty good, when we heard the <br/>
ominous thumping from the front left tire. FLAT! We pulled over, <br/>
luckily, in a lit parking lot to change the tire, happy to see that <br/>
we could at least get a little shelter from the wind - aaaaaand <br/>
discovered that the spare was flat too. Of course. But no worries! <br/>
There is a gas station just 2 blocks away - if we can just limp there <br/>
everything will be all good. Yay! We made it! Except.... their Air <br/>
Pump is broken. (I kid you not) We limp another 2 miles down the road <br/>
flashers flashing, traffic squealing around us, to the next station, <br/>
where blessedly, the air pump works. Small mercies! This would be <br/>
around 7:15pm - and we are 30 minutes away from Leesburg on a highly <br/>
questionable spare. We face the reality that the fates are simply NOT <br/>
going to allow us to attend this event. We'd best just throw in the <br/>
towel, before the fates pull out the REALLY big guns. We were so <br/>
bummed to miss the event, we decide, to cheer ourselves up, we'd get <br/>
a nice dinner at a local restaurant. Just when we are sitting down, <br/>
with a sigh of relief that the nightmare is over - the place is <br/>
plunged into darkness by a power outage!!! Some days ya just can't <br/>
win... ;-)<br/>
<br/>
It's probably just as well we didn't make it - with the kind of luck <br/>
we had that night, the bars probably would have run out of beer or <br/>
something! <br/>
<br/>
Thanks for planning the event, even though we missed it - next time <br/>
for sure! :-)</div>
