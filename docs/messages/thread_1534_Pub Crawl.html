                    <div id="ygrps-yiv-1718417321">Kudos to Poison Ivy for all the chutzpah it took to set this up, <br/>
especially after reading his report. "What letterbox?" said half the <br/>
bartenders when he went to set up. <br/>
<br/>
He made a great choice for a final destination. The King's Court was <br/>
casual enough and large enough to be invaded by a gang of <br/>
letterboxers. <br/>
<br/>
It was fabulous that so many people came from out of town: DE, PA, NJ, <br/>
NY, MA, Willowdale, Oz, and that faraway place Virginians seldom <br/>
visit ... Maryland. It was great to meet the Walkers, Craftymouse and <br/>
Dandelion, Yuri Nahl, and Geckospot, and to see Team Green <br/>
Dragon, "meet" the Reaper, and see Wink and Tarheel again. And all the <br/>
usual local suspects. Hikers &amp; Hounds and MizScarlet, you're locals <br/>
now. <br/>
<br/>
I stood dumbstruck watching the Brew Hounds dance for their worm. At <br/>
least I think that's what they were doing. I was awed by their <br/>
fantastic, fun, row of team stamps at the bar. MisScarlet has an ever <br/>
increasing wicked sense of humor. <br/>
<br/>
What a great bunch of stamps. And I only got the last two places and <br/>
some bonuses. I am amazed at the variety of establishments. <br/>
<br/>
Congrats to the win by Dead Duck Chuck and Tempus Fugit. The scavenger <br/>
hunt looked challenging, inspired and wicked. Why am I not surprised <br/>
they won? <br/>
<br/>
I want to hear more from the people who did the whole crawl. Or at <br/>
least what you can remember. He sent you to a biker bar!?<br/>

Gallant Rouge came up with a game plan that was<br/>
flawless, I hope he will poost it as a model for other<br/>
events such as this. Lightfoot and Bacchus were great<br/>
spots I want to visit again to enjoy at a more<br/>

have stayed there all night, loved the band. The VC's<br/>
are Doxie Dolly's, but that's a whole other story.<br/>

We'll actually be in Virginia for five full days, so if anyone has any <br/>
specific recommendations about boxes in the area, please let me know.  <br/>
We enjoy some longer hikes, so those are of particular interest.<br/>

Of course we're compiling a book of clues and maps based on what we <br/>
