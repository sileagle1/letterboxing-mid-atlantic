the chalk at the table in the "biker bar". After certain unnamed <br/>
crawlers stole the chalk cubes... and would not share even a nose <br/>
rub, I walked (ok ... staggered! ) from the chalkless "King's Balls" <br/>
back up the street to the Downtown Saloon where the billiard action <br/>
was hot. By the way, as I had broken my own rule by drinking in EVERY <br/>
bar... I was feeling no pain. Unfortunately, while I was very <br/>
handsome, the invisibility was not working. (Snowflakes on my <br/>
shoulders?) Seeing the joint was jumping without any hint of slowing, <br/>
I waited for the slightest opportunity to chalk my beak! I watched <br/>
the players and the crowd around the table to see if there was a <br/>
pugilists in there midst. There were none. These were Suburban <br/>
Dentist Bikers. No need for my being timid. But I did not want to be <br/>
overtly ungallant and rude. And then it came... a break in the game <br/>
action! After a spectacular crowd pleasing shot on the seven ball in <br/>
the side pocket... the shooter paused to down a long swallow of <br/>
golden beverage.... as if making a show of it for the crowd. This was <br/>
my moment! To the disbelieving stares from those assembled ... I <br/>
nonchalantly approached the table, daitily picking up the cube off <br/>
the rail... quickly chalking my pointed nose as if I did it all the <br/>
time, then feeling their eyes upon me I strolled toward the front of <br/>
the bar, grinning and nodding all the way to the sidewalk.</div>

 Hey, I didn't steal chalk cubes, I stole a chalk cube. I didn't take <br/>
it from a table, I swiped it from behind the bar in Champions. A very <br/>
risky bit of sleight of hand and distraction, if I must say so myself. <br/>
As for not sharing, I have no excuse, I was lit and being overly <br/>
competitive. You would think buying the pizza would of made up for any <br/>
ill will.<br/>
<br/>
We had a great time.<br/>
