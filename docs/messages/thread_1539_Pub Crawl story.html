the tavern announcing the winners. The smiling rascal in the background <br/>
is moi enjoying the unknown number beers at that point.....I don't <br/>
recall standing there. I also was bummed I didn't make it to Balls <br/>
Bluff Tavern...I was told today that I did. I apparently wasn't <br/>
focusing well at that point. I do recall leaning over peoples tables <br/>
at "Thouroughbreds" to look at the pictures behind them in search of <br/>
one of the clues. I believe that was when I was directed by one of the <br/>
staff as to the exact location of the picture and where I could find <br/>
one of the other boxes. Oh, and who ever bought me that drink of <br/>
whatever it was at the Kings Court Tavern...Thanks!...unless ofcourse I <br/>
already thanked you, in which case....nevermind! <br/>
       Safe trails to all!<br/>
