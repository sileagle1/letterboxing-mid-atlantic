boxes here. I'm as guilty as anyone. We're still around, but I <br/>
haven't been out letterboxing at all this month. With the nice <br/>
weather, Chuck would rather be out on the boat on weekends. I have <br/>
been carving a stamp for the October Mansfield Monster mash (I know, <br/>
I know...coals to Newcastle!). And I need to make a log for another <br/>
stamp that's otherwise ready to go [please email me ;)]. <br/>

and I plan to place a few boxes to help the cause.  I also<br/>
hope to find a few while in your area, but time will be<br/>
limited due to all the planned sightseeing.  I'm not used<br/>
to so many letterboxes to choose from.<br/>
Also, since I am from Texas, hot and muggy won't stop me!<br/>

in the group can give you a run down on what's missing and what's <br/>
doable for you time frame / boxing preferences.<br/>

&gt; My family and I are coming to VA/DC/MD area in 2 1/2 weeks<br/>
&gt; and I plan to place a few boxes to help the cause.  I also<br/>
&gt; hope to find a few while in your area, but time will be<br/>
&gt; limited due to all the planned sightseeing.  I'm not used<br/>
&gt; to so many letterboxes to choose from.<br/>
&gt; Also, since I am from Texas, hot and muggy won't stop me!<br/>
