got the first piece of the scavenger hunt before the<br/>
games got started. PI assumed that the woman on the<br/>
corner barstool was just checking out his hot bod when<br/>
actually she was ogling the other goodies.  ;-)<br/>
<br/>
The Catoctin Crawlers saw every bar except Tuscarora. <br/>
That stamp was acquired by half the team while Koyote<br/>
marked territory.  It's the only pub stamp I'm missing<br/>
:-(<br/>
<br/>
After Spanky's we hit Champions, then Red Hot &amp; Blue -<br/>
we got stuck here for awhile as the game wound down.<br/>
From there we hit Thoroughbreds, probably the only bar<br/>
I'll easily be able to avoid on future trips due to<br/>
slow service and REALLY high prices, although the beer<br/>
sampler was tasty.  I recommend the 3 middle beers,<br/>
the darkest and lightest of the 5 are just too dark<br/>
(tastes like coffee) and light.  And don't order a<br/>
mixed drink unless you've just won the lottery!<br/>
<br/>
We really got rolling after that. We all had a great<br/>
time at Bacchus and I'd love to get back there to try<br/>
their menu.  That bartender was fabulous.  <br/>
<br/>
What's 3.14?  A Bible verse?  A mile marker?  The<br/>
length of who's what?<br/>
IT'S PI!!! (you idiots!) - Leave it to the teacher to<br/>
help us all get our heads out of our butts!  We just<br/>
were not getting it on our own even though we knew we<br/>
needed to go to Mom's Apple Pie.  Doh!  <br/>
<br/>
The 2 drive-bys were fairly uneventful and quick but<br/>
the group really wanted to get to the historic<br/>
district, so the team split up to grab Tuscarora and<br/>
we met up again at Lightfoots.<br/>
<br/>
Fancy, fancy - neat old building.  The last 3 bars are<br/>
kind of a blur.  Despite the smog, I mean smoke, in<br/>
the Downtown Saloon I'd've loved to stay.  The band<br/>
was fun, the pool tables were active, and the people<br/>
were having a great time.<br/>
<br/>
Koyote - That drink in King's Court was a soco and<br/>
lime.  Also, the backwards dart board stamp came from<br/>
Ball's Bluff.<br/>
<br/>
Our team would have done better on the scavenger hunt<br/>
if we hadn't been so rocked!  Our strategies kinda<br/>
fell apart after Lightfoot when the team shrank and<br/>
babysitters had to be released.  I didn't realize it<br/>
was getting so late.<br/>
<br/>
I got 4 of the bone-us boxes and lots of personal<br/>
stamps.  I even lucked out and got a series that is<br/>
soon to be released into the wilds of NJ (I think it's<br/>
NJ).  Fabulous stamps all around the town!  There's<br/>
some amazing artists.<br/>
<br/>
The cab ride to the hotel was interesting too.  I got<br/>
to finish my beer and help close the bar while Koyote<br/>
and D of DJ2A grabbed a cab.  The bartender fetched me<br/>
a cab and it happened to include Koyote and D!  How'd<br/>
that happen?  I was confused but pleased and soon<br/>
snoring soundly until the phone rang and HNH and SSB<br/>
were asking about breakfast.  UGH, it's still the<br/>
middle of the night isn't it?<br/>
<br/>
sigh, so up I got, got out of the hotel and joined<br/>
those 2 for breakfast at Johnson's.  Got another<br/>
stamp, had a light breakfast, and headed down the<br/>
road.  I did end up grabbing a nap about an hour up<br/>
the road but was good to go after that.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks again to Poison Ivy for a great time and not<br/>
TOO bad of a hangover!<br/>

Pictures will follow.<br/>
