that I'm down and out with a yucky stomach bug that has been going <br/>
around my world.  When I recover and rejoin the land of the living, <br/>
I'll be in touch about boxing as usual!<br/>
<br/>
I do have three PLBs right now... Lips, Watership Down, and <br/>
Frank-N-Furter.  I'll get them all moving along just as soon as <br/>
possible.<br/>
<br/>
Wednesday Bowler and Celtic Cat... I know we talked about the <br/>
possibility of meeting up today.  Unfortunately, that's not going to <br/>
work (obviously)... what does next Sunday look like for you???<br/>
<br/>
Thanks and sorry if I missed any specifics.  I'll catch up as soon as <br/>
my brain and body allow!<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for your understanding...<br/>
