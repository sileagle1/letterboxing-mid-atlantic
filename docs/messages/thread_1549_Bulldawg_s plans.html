                    <div id="ygrps-yiv-1039005240">Ok, i am focusing a lot of 2006 on one series that i hope to be <br/>
nationwide..and consist of long hikes that require lots of <br/>
effort...the details of the seies are yet to come to the public,<br/>
but i have so far carved 4 detailed stamps for it, with hikers willing <br/>
to plant in NY, oregon, texas, and CT....This will be my focus for <br/>
this season, and looking for more hiders of the series (up to 20 <br/>
stamps)..in return, i can hide a stamp for you in the VA area..this <br/>
series will be something different, with focus on the entire <br/>
adventure..the hike, the clues, the box, the stamp, and the <br/>
book.....These stamps are not to be found by the weekend boxer <br/>
looking for a quick find.  The best finds are those you earn..Too much <br/>
is placed on the "count" (IMO) Quality over quanity...Its a<br/>
topic that I love, and again, want to take this to the next <br/>
level...along with this, i will do 2 more series in NoVA with "cops <br/>
and robbers"..and still have a meeting with Koyote on wed..(with <br/>
beers, no doubt)..to start planning a great "event" for Northern <br/>
Virginia....that will again, be something <br/>
unique....<br/>
<br/>
Im hoping Poison Ivy will plant one for me, in his extreme style <br/>
inWest Va, or where he choses....I am trying to get the cream of the <br/>
crof involved....Maybe evn Koyote will plant one on his longer hikes, <br/>
being crazy like he is...Some of the planters planting so far are <br/>
pretty impressive...stay tuned, more details to come, on my site<br/>
<br/>
Peace.....<br/>

And I am the LAST person to try to impose my will, or my personal boxing prefernces on anyone. I think boxing should be organic and continue to evolve and grow. I get frustrated with some boxers who complain that boxing has changed and long for the "good old days" when boxers did things a certain way. If you compare us to England, ours is a very different hobby. My only concern is for safety. Even experienced cavers die in caves. Bad air, equipment failure, falls, rock slides, surface rainstorms and cave flooding,  getting lost and hypothermia are just some of the reasons why.So you're all correct, know your limits and listen to your gut.

                    <div id="ygrps-yiv-584830051">yes Gallant...the "18 years" box is kinda extreme, and a bit <br/>
scary..It feels like you are breaking the law...I have posted this <br/>
before, but when that was planted, I had a wild cat jump at me from <br/>
above and scared the "dootie" out of me....Its cool to see that you <br/>
researched the box, did your homework, and completed more clues to <br/>
verify the location...Kudos to you....Good to see guys enjoy the <br/>
challenge...Also, you did my cops and robbers #2..which has only <br/>
been done 3 times so far...again, hope you find all these clues <br/>
cool.  I have some unposted clues to local WOM's by me and others<br/>
(that want them spread)..ill contact you offline<br/>
<br/>
BTW the clues for "18 years" is currently unavailable, and the box <br/>
is in the process of relocation...still it bothers me to move it, <br/>
but the place and the "box" itself might land me in jail...<br/>
