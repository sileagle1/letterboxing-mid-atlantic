for the library? Ours is always changing theirs, it would be interesting if you 
could keep changing it with the revolving themes! the current themes here in 
Hampton roads are "Step to the beat...read!" "Rock 'N' Read"  and "Get into 
the rhythm and read!" They change sometimes monthly, sometimes seasonally. It's 
an idea anyway! Good luck! This is something I can really get into, I love 
books! Kerri</font></span></div>
