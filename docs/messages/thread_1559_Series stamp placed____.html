series for '06....I was possibly gonna do an exchange with HnH, as see <br/>
sheDID call me, but my phone was in the car!!!!!, so i missed you...I <br/>
have yet to check the messeges, but im guessing you did call..terribly <br/>
sorry, and hope i didnt prolong your trip back home.  I was deep in <br/>
the woods anyway, and an exchange would have been hard to time out.  <br/>
Once in the woods a few miles a realized i didnt have my phone, so i <br/>
planted a box to reveal my identy to anyone willing to hike for <br/>
it...let me know.<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, the first series box was planted today, and i even impressed <br/>
myself with the over box hike, stamp, book, and views....Not sure how <br/>
im gonna publish them,..im guessing on my blog or something...<br/>
<br/>
Peace, and have a good week guys and gals.<br/>
