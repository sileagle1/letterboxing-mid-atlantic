<font face="Arial,sans-serif"><font size="2">Well, I have not been too
busy of late, but have gotten a few boxes found in the past couple of
weeks.<br/>
<br/>
Two weeks ago I road up to Doylestown to go to a friends house.  I got
"Boxers or Briefs"
(<a class="ygrps-yiv-1903793353moz-txt-link-freetext" href="http://www.atlasquest.com/lboxes/clue.html?gBoxId=11861" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.atlasquest.com/lboxes/clue.html?gBoxId=11861</a>) on the way
over, but managed to leave my personal stamp at home, so I'll have to
head back there again to stamp in.  It had a nice stamp, but I don't
get it???  I met Cetic Cat and Wednsday Bowler on trail, they were
after the same box.<br/>
<br/>
I was going to try to meet up with those two again on Sunday, along
with Swallowdale, but I simply lost track of time and never made it.<br/>
<br/>
This Saturday I was out at Fort Indiantown Gap, and stopped at Memorial
Lake State Park to find "Luck Be A Lady"
(<a class="ygrps-yiv-1903793353moz-txt-link-freetext" href="http://www.letterboxing.org/BoxView.php?boxnum=17934&amp;boxname=Luck_Be_A_Lady" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.letterboxing.org/BoxView.php?boxnum=17934&amp;boxname=Luck_Be_A_Lady</a>). 
Store bought stamp, but a nice walk that gave me some ideas ;-)<br/>
<br/>
Today I checked on some boxes.  "A Nice View" is still in fine shape
over looking Berks County.  My Pagoda box was fine, but it seems Penn
Tower is missing.  So, I pulled the whole series, and will replant
shortly with all new stamps and locations.<br/>
