Stars and D3 were the last folks to stamp into my Pagoda box, on
January 28 in fact.  I believe I found something that may belong to
them.  I think they are new boxes, but if they are on the list or
anyone knows who they are, can you have them contact me off list?<br/>
<br/>
BTW, forgot to mention in my update post, I also checked on Silent
Ducks...err...Doug's box while I was at it.  It is in fine shape, high
and dry, though the logbook bag is ripped.  I will endeavor to replace
it when I replant my new boxes.<br/>
