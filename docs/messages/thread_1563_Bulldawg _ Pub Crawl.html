<br/>
Look deep in your logbooks (PI, sewso, HnH, Scarlet, Geko, PWalker, <br/>
Wink.....not sure if those are right?)  As on the last pages you will <br/>
find a "one time only" BullDawg stamp..I think in the last 10-20 <br/>
pages.  I showed up late in the attire mentioned for the "mystery <br/>
guest", but maybe you all were too hammered...anyway, i stood, and <br/>
watched....logged into a few books, and had arranged for a bartender <br/>
to help me out (pulling those local strings!)...I also put a an <br/>
envelope in the bathroom for "shananagens"..it said "LBNA".....no one <br/>
found it as I went and got it, and looked for my "see ya in the morn" <br/>
stamp the day after....<br/>
<br/>
there are more clues...but want you all to figure em out....<br/>
<br/>
If not, Gallant might get the key to solving it by saturday..<br/>
<br/>
stay tuned......</div>

Arts Letterbox. I'm sure it's a beautiful hike. I'm going to obtain <br/>
the following:<br/>
<br/>
1) The type of martial art named in the logbook.<br/>
2) A description of the logbook, and type of cover it has.<br/>
3) A description of the stamp impression.<br/>
<br/>
I will email this info to you (only) and trust you will send me <br/>
additional clues to another non-traditional letterbox nearby.<br/>
<br/>
I will again hike out to the Martial Arts LetterBox and begin the <br/>
search for the other WOM.<br/>
<br/>
I'm going to assume you are a "dawg" of your word.<br/>
<br/>
I'm going to trust there is actually two boxes out there... and that <br/>
I won't get a mocking post that... " it was there... I just didn't <br/>
find it".<br/>

I was watching and asking!  By the time we got to the<br/>
Downtown Saloon things were getting iffy though.<br/>
<br/>
My vote is Bulldawg is either the guy in Lightfoot or<br/>
the bra-less bartender in Balls Bluff.<br/>
<br/>
Waiting for more clues.<br/>

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; so here ya go:<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Look deep in your logbooks (PI, sewso, HnH,<br/>

&gt; the<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; last pages you will <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; find a "one time only" BullDawg stamp..I think<br/>
&gt; in<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; the last 10-20 <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; pages.  I showed up late in the attire<br/>
&gt; mentioned for<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; the "mystery <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; guest", but maybe you all were too<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; hammered...anyway, i stood, and <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; watched....logged into a few books, and had<br/>
&gt; arranged<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; for a bartender <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; to help me out (pulling those local<br/>
&gt; strings!)...I<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; also put a an <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; envelope in the bathroom for "shananagens"..it<br/>
&gt; said<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; "LBNA".....no one <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; found it as I went and got it, and looked for<br/>
&gt; my<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; "see ya in the morn" <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; stamp the day after....<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; there are more clues...but want you all to<br/>
&gt; figure em<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; out....<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; If not, Gallant might get the key to solving<br/>
