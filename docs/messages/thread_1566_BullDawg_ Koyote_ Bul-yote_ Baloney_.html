                    <div id="ygrps-yiv-1905444093">GR, I am truely honored you found the trip worth it.  I dare to find a <br/>
better local hike in views, trails, clues, and overall box location (a <br/>
true cool area to hide a box).  It is  bit of a hike but the journey <br/>
makes the stamp secondary.  I gave Koyote all the stamps in his book <br/>
tonight for all those that are getting mailed nation-wide...And Koyote <br/>
was impressed, which made me more dedicated to complete this series.  <br/>
I have put a lot into it, and the reward for me is gallant rogue's <br/>
reaction to the hike..and not the actual clue for the future <br/>
stamp.....congrats on finding it...it is an honor to have you trek in <br/>
the rain for the box that i planted in the rain.<br/>
<br/>
you make letterboxing worth my effort, and i applaude you, and would <br/>
love to meet for beers next weekend.<br/>

boxes this year, as i feel I am aiming towards top notch locations in <br/>
VA...Your words are great and again motivate me to continue the series <br/>
that I think will take a lot of the nation by storm.  As a local VA <br/>
guy, and after hearing your appreciatio for "dedication"...you can bet <br/>
I will plant a few more in  the area for guys like your self...It <br/>
sounds odd, but I really appreciate the last wording of your post.  It <br/>
makes me realize that this box is more important than my identy, even <br/>
to the guy that wants to know my identy the most....you!...again, you <br/>
have yet to disappoint me....you are a great boxer, and would love a <br/>
mini-gather with you this weekend after you complete part 2...my <br/>
coconern is making sure you, make the trek back out there, and not sew-<br/>
so, KOC, or others...so, i need a way to assure that......but thanks <br/>
agagain.....the reward was awesome....<br/>

&gt; GR...thanks fot the kind words...This is the reaction i want from <br/>
my <br/>
&gt; boxes this year, as i feel I am aiming towards top notch locations <br/>
in <br/>
&gt; VA...Your words are great and again motivate me to continue the <br/>
series <br/>
&gt; that I think will take a lot of the nation by storm.  As a local <br/>
VA <br/>
&gt; guy, and after hearing your appreciatio for "dedication"...you can <br/>
bet <br/>
&gt; I will plant a few more in  the area for guys like your self...It <br/>
&gt; sounds odd, but I really appreciate the last wording of your <br/>
post.  It <br/>
&gt; makes me realize that this box is more important than my identy, <br/>
even <br/>
&gt; to the guy that wants to know my identy the most....you!...again, <br/>
you <br/>
&gt; have yet to disappoint me....you are a great boxer, and would love <br/>
a <br/>
&gt; mini-gather with you this weekend after you complete part 2...my <br/>
&gt; coconern is making sure you, make the trek back out there, and not <br/>
sew-<br/>
&gt; so, KOC, or others...so, i need a way to assure that......but <br/>
thanks <br/>
&gt; agagain.....the reward was awesome....<br/>

&gt; &gt; A rose by any other name would smell as sweet!<br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; I just completed the WOM LB "Dedication" ...  which proves my <br/>
&gt; &gt; dedication considering it was cold &amp; wet! Solong as there are <br/>
hikes <br/>
&gt; &gt; and boxes such as these.... I don't really care what trail name <br/>
or <br/>
&gt; &gt; identity is claimed. The maps I downloaded were misleading... <br/>
but <br/>
&gt; the <br/>
&gt; &gt; WOM clues were incredibly acurate, the hike a reward initself... <br/>
the <br/>
&gt; &gt; letterbox a special treat!<br/>
