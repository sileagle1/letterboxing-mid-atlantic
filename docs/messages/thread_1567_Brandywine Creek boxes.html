(finally had to resort to putting it on the outer baggie covering).  Interestingly enough, they hadn't pulled box 4 of Into the Woods (strange, people usually can't find box 2).  They HAD pulled Silver Eagle's Brandywine Bluebird microbox.  I felt bad leaving it there in the confiscated bin with somebody's peanut-butter-jar geocache....  </div> <div> </div> <div>It didn't seem like placement was an issue, even for the one that was in the wall (btw, there was more damage done by the park ranger who pulled it out of there than by 8 months of letterboxers--I had to put two major stones back in)  So I emailed Silver Eagle &amp; hopefully that
 one will go back in also.  But if/when I plant in a DE state park again, I will definitely go the permit route first.</div><p>
