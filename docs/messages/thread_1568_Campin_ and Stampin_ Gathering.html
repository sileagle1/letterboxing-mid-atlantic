                    <div id="ygrps-yiv-1279470915">Well, I'm pretty sure I am going to throw together a camping gathering sometimes in June and have a poll open on LBMA to get an idea of the best dates. I am the laziest human on the planet so my goal in hosting a gathering is to pick a place with lot's of boxes already and just kind of be a "squatter" and host a gathering. No months of planning, carving, planting. I'll just show up with some grub and other boxers will show up and bingo! we have a gather. My very first gathering was a camping gathering hosted by Celtic Pride May or June (or July?) of '04 and it was so much fun I want to do it again! Speaking of Celctic Pride, has anyone heard from Eileen or Bernadette recently? Anyway, I digress, we had a great night eating Schizokeet's smores and playing games brought by Scarab and Nightowl, Judy made the best burgers I ever had and we were serenaded by about a billion cicadas. I can't guarantee cicadas but I can promise good food and lot's of boxes within an hours drive of either
 Patapsco State Park or Little Bennett in Maryland. So think about it, vote in the poll if you have a date pereference as I'll probably close the poll in a week or so. All you need is a tent. I have ton's of supplies and Dude and I will be the in charge of feeding everyone. Hope to see you there!<p>
