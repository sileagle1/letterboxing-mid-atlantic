Middlesex Counties you have probably found a Martian Maggot letterbox. <br/>
<br/>
I am in the process of identifying the missing Martian Maggot boxes and <br/>
need your help if you have found one of her boxes in past years... I <br/>
know this may have been a while ago as these were planted circa 2001-<br/>
2003. <br/>
<br/>
I can't find some of her boxes, but in many cases I know it is because <br/>
the waypoints in the clues are gone, disintegrated, or vandalized; the <br/>
box may still be there. For example, for the Cheesequake Crabbing <br/>
Bridge letterbox, the "two birch trees that point the way" have <br/>
completely fallen apart; do you remember where they pointed? (Across <br/>
the path, up the hill behind the path, up the hill past the wooded <br/>
area, or in the wooded area?)<br/>
<br/>
Send me hints directly: do not post them here. <br/>
