<div>Wellllllllllllll, I was going to FINALLY get OUT of the city this Sunday and do some boxing, but that whole nor'easter, maybe 12" of snow Sunday morning has kind of put a damper on that I suppose. My luck. So, tomorrow before it starts, I'm going to replace two boxes, change the container in one, and tweak the hiding place on another one and scout a location I have in mind for a new one. </div>

<div>I've been a little discouraged about boxing lately, but someone came and did my "A Splendid View" Series, and a couple of other ones that hadn't been found and I'm off to the Seeking Sun gathering next weekend if we don't have another blizzard, so I'm feeling better. And someone did one of my series in Colorado, which hadn't been done since last June or so. I was so excited that they are still safe and sound!! My friend out there doesn't get a chance to check them toooooooooooo often. Woo-hooooo! Boxing Lives In Gotham!! </div>
