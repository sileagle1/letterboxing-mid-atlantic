<div>I'm snowed in today, but yesterday I managed to replace my King Kong box, replace the container that Irish Diaspora is in (if you have any Seattle Filmworks cannisters laying around the house, they are totally waterproof), and place one new box, "Lives To Dance, Hah-Cha-Cha!" I wound up putting it at one of the locations I was scouting out for another one. Then I was going to scout the other place but by then both my knee joints had turned into solid blocks of ice, so I headed home just as the snow was starting to come down. </div>
