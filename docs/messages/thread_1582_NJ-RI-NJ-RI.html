<div><font face="Arial" size="2">Here in RI if it's winter, ie out of season, our 
State Parks waive the parking fees. Not so in NJ - $5 to drive down to look for 
Mosquito Madness LB. We needed more time and the snow was not cooperating. So, 
now we['ll have to invest another $5 to try to find the box. :(</font></div>
