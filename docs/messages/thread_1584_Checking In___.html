Funny you should mention actual Tupperware.  Fly Killer (Mrs. LB) was <br/>
doing some kitchen cleaning and came across some Tupperware that was <br/>
placed in the "Donate" box.  "Noooooh!" came the cry from yours truly.  <br/>
I snarfed them up quickly, placed appropriate hideables in them (future <br/>
skyscraper series for a town known for Structural Steel).  The only <br/>
aroma was dishwasher cleaner smell, something I doubt that varmints <br/>
would find appetizing.<br/>
<br/>
Never look Gift Tupperware in the mouth!  (Or the recycle box)<br/>

                    <div id="ygrps-yiv-32688990">I hope we can make it.  The little one is getting to the age where I think she will enjoy a <br/>
little walk in the woods.  The older one has me running from karate to drawing classes to <br/>
birthday parties, so I haven't been out on the trail - until this week.<br/>
<br/>
I had some free time in Atlanta this week and the nice little park down the street had 3 <br/>
boxes within spitting distance of each other for a quick score.  I don't know who was <br/>
poaching who, but I was able to get stamps and introduce a couple of co-workers to the <br/>
joys of 'boxing.<br/>
<br/>
They were trying to be all cool and blase until it became clear from the clue where the box <br/>
was hidden and suddenly they were running ahead and moving rocks like a couple of kids. <br/>
Its fun to watch the reactions of newbies.<br/>
<br/>
Then, by chance, I ended up working in a nature preserve outside of Atlanta.  Lucky me.  <br/>
So Dekalb County has a new letterbox - #4 in my PA Postcard Series.  The nature preserve <br/>
marks its trail with cairns.  I wanted to be cruel and just have the clue read: "look under <br/>
the suspicious pile of stones."  But I took mercy.<br/>
<br/>
I have some time coming up in Spokane and San Diego.  It's funny - I only seem to be able <br/>
to 'box when I'm working.<br/>
<br/>
Hope to see y'all outh there soon.<br/>
