<br/>
But of course!  Anyway, one thing to be wary of in maintaining a HH<br/>
Hostel (or H³ in bug speak) is that folks will occaisionally forget<br/>
the purpose and take a HH without leaving one.  I know from<br/>
experience with my South Mountain H³, needing to occaisionally moey<br/>
up there to make sure it is properly stocked.<br/>
<br/>
Not sure when I will get down to Tyler, but I hope it shall be within<br/>
the next month.<br/>
<br/>
On Monday (Pres Day) Team Little Dawg, Star War Lego and I will be<br/>
out in their neck of the woods doing some stuff in a place formerly<br/>
owned by a hosiery baron.  Got some local stuff to plant and a series<br/>
of Pinewood Derby Races to run this weekend.<br/>

A parasite travels from HH to HH. A cootie you place<br/>
on a person without thier knowledge. HH used to be a<br/>
rare event but now it seems there's one in every other<br/>
box. Not complaning my son loves the cootie, parasite<br/>
,HH or any other spin you could possibly put on a box.<br/>

&gt; They'd best not. <br/>
&gt;  <br/>
&gt; There is a HH there now.  Also--since LB's present was not a HH, <br/>
it is <br/>
&gt; intact.  (Had it been a HH of course it would be gone now.  )  But <br/>
&gt; perhaps a stock of tokens would be wise.<br/>

You are correct.  Ideally, if the box is large enough, you<br/>
can 'seed' it with several.  I usually try to keep 2 or so up on<br/>
South Mountain.<br/>

And you just planted HOW many?<br/>
 <br/>
OK--word problem time: if a boxer can find one LB box per week, and <br/>
every other week LB plants 4 boxes, how long will it be before the <br/>
first boxer needs to put LB out of commission so (s)he can catch up????<br/>
 <br/>
Either that or quit his/her job &amp; just box full time....<br/>
