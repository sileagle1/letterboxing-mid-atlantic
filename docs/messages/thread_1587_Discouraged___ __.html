                    <div id="ygrps-yiv-203067016">Okay, guys.  I'm just getting a little bit discouraged here.  It has to <br/>
do with planting boxes and then having them go missing very quickly.  <br/>
Nothing to do with the other discussions out there about missing <br/>
boxes... just my own personal woes.  I haven't been planting for very <br/>
long... just since late November of '05.  I've planted 13 boxes so far <br/>
(if you include the 2 hitch-hikers that I have done).  Of those, 3 are <br/>
pretty much definitely missing.  Are those normal odds?  One box was my <br/>
pwn fault.  It was "Cute as a Button" and I just flat-out picked a bad <br/>
spot for it.  The other two... well, I don't know... I'm still working <br/>
on improving my hiding spots, so maybe they could have been in better <br/>
places, too.<br/>
<br/>
As I've progressed in letterboxing over the past few months, I've <br/>
started investing more and more (both financially and time- and <br/>
energy-wise) into each box that I plant.  That's because I really want <br/>
to do quality boxes.  So I've been working on improving my carving, my <br/>
clues, my logbooks, my hiding places, and even my containers!  I really <br/>
wanted to do quality plants.<br/>
<br/>
It's very hard emotionally to invest that much into a box and then have <br/>
it go missing in a few weeks.  I guess some would say, "Invest less in <br/>
your boxes," but that's simply not the way I want to do it.  In fact, I <br/>
was already making plans for a box called "Le Bec-Fin" that would be <br/>
just exquisite... top of the line in every way.  Stuff like this <br/>
really, really, really gives me pause about doing something like that.<br/>
<br/>
Any suggestions?  Harder clues?  Longer hikes?  Wading through <br/>
waist-high marshes infested with leeches and hungry alligators?<br/>
<br/>
I'm just bummed out, bummed out, bummed out.  But open to suggestions!<br/>
<br/>
Thanks,<br/>

<br/>
How exactly do you place your boxes?<br/>
<br/>
Under rocks? Under twigs? Wedged in a tree?<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Gallant Rogue is notorious for finding a four in one tree about 20 ft <br/>
from the trail and hiding a box there...wedges among the multi <br/>
trunks... out of view... off the ground... less likely to be flooded <br/>
or accidently discovered.<br/>
<br/>
I think some boxers place to much faith in forest floor debris like <br/>
leaves and bark. I have found boxes on the side of the main traffic <br/>
path with just a handfull of leaves for security!<br/>
<br/>
I try not to place a box on the ground, but when I do... it will be <br/>
under several grapefruit size stones to anchor and conceal.</div>

<div>Gallant Rogue is right. Boxes on the ground need weight to stay in place. 
Forest critters are especially interested in boxes that are hogging spacw in 
another wise nice warm niche in a tree stump or rock outcropping. Also, if your 
boxes are drive-bys in an otherwise popular area; I wouldn't count on the box 
going undetected.</div>
<div>   I think boxes that are farther out on a path tend to last 
longer. I found 9 boxes yesterday of which 4 are 3 years+ old and by boxers that 
are no longer active...Still there and in good shape with people continuing to 
visit. </div>
<div>   Keep planting, you will get the knack. Safe trails.</div>

</span></blockquote>Your frustration is completely understandable.  Placing boxes is one of <br/>
those things that you just learn a knack for over time, after placing a <br/>
few and finding even more.  I think everyone here can recount the <br/>
mistakes they have made planting boxes and how they have learned from <br/>
them.  Here are a few of the tips I have picked up over time:<br/>
<br/>
-The smaller, the better.  A small stamp in a small box can often do the <br/>
same job as  a large one, with the added benefit that they can fit in <br/>
more places and are easier to conceal.<br/>
<br/>
-Keep it away from trails.  Unless you have a specific reason for <br/>
planting a box very close to a trail or other heavily used area, it is <br/>
best to place the box a few hundred feet into the woods, and use <br/>
landmarks or compass work to guide people to the boxes.  Personally, <br/>
boxes that are hidden in the middle of no where are often my favorites <br/>
to find as well.<br/>
<br/>
-Camouflage helps.  You can get camo netting in Walmart or other stores <br/>
that sell outdoors gear.  It really helps in hiding the box.<br/>
<br/>
-Survey the area.  Is the area that you want to plant in heavily used? <br/>
Is there a lot of trash or bottles around that make it a teen hang out? <br/>
  Are there signs of flood damage?  If it is winter, is there a lot of <br/>
dead foliage on the ground?  These are questions to ask yourself when <br/>
you are looking over the area you want to place your box in.<br/>
<br/>
-Plant off the ground if you can.  This will help keep the box safe from <br/>
flooding and dry.  If you can't, good places on the ground are in tree <br/>
roots with rocks over the box, or under boulders with rocks in front of <br/>
the box.  Stone walls also make great hiding spots.  What ever you do, <br/>
use rocks to cover the box, they will help secure it from water and animals.<br/>
<br/>
-Don't get discouraged.  Boxes go missing for all sorts of reasons. <br/>
Don't get discouraged by it.  Just have fun!<br/>

<div>Well, some boxers enjoy leeches sucking at their bodies, but I don't think you have to go that far. &lt;s&gt; I think most people lose some boxes in the beginning and then they learn from their mistakes and get better at hiding them. I do mostly urban boxes so I haven't had a whole lot of experience placing boxes in rural areas. I'd say that first rate, air tight, water tight, and hopefully smell tight containers would be really important. LocknLock are great. I'm placing a series in Central Park this weekend and will be on the lookout for logs, rocks, and various dark and sneaky places. Maybe you're worried about them being easy for boxers to get to. Not to worry there. Most intrepid boxers will wade streams, dig through thorns and stick their hands into places most people fear to tread. </div>
<div> </div>
<div>I'd bet that you'll get better with experience.  Hang in there. You sound like someone that boxing needs. </div>
