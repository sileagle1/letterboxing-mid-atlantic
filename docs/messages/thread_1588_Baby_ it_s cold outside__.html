were wondering if you were successful.  After all, you had Coach <br/>
Sheba along, who actually did help me plant that rascal last July.  I <br/>
do recall Rick painfully wanting that box too, so kudos!  The main <br/>
question is, were you all the first to find it?  Pretty up there <br/>
isn't it?<br/>

Stay tuned for more fun in the next few days....<br/>
