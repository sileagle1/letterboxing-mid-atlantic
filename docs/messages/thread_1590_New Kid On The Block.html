 My name is Steve aka I Spy on LBSE. I am pulling up stakes in Atlanta<br/>
were I have lived for the last 18 months and taking a job in<br/>
Georgetown near DC. I will be living in Alexandria. I haven't seen a<br/>
whole lot of boxes posted in my area but maybe you can point me in the<br/>
right direction. Look forward to maybe meeting some of you.<br/>

<br/>
It seems that DC boxes appear and disappear all the time.  Last I knew, <br/>
Ted E Bear and Orion were still there, but I could be wrong now.<br/>
<br/>
There is some great boxing around DC, there are a ton of parks, and they <br/>
all seem to have boxes in them.<br/>
<br/>
Be sure to sign up for Hikers &amp; Hound's Stampn' and Campn' gathering in <br/>
June, which will be not far outside DC.<br/>
