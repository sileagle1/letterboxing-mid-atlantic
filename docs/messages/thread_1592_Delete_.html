Apparently they're getting pretty savvy and check the sites and web frequently for boxes <br/>
placed in their little fiefdoms.  <br/>
<br/>
One suggestion I have used is to not put the actual name of the park - or of any specific <br/>
features (i.e. "Old Faithful") in the clue.  It won't stop a ranger from cruising lb.org or AQ, <br/>
but it will foil a Google search.  <br/>
<br/>
If you are web savvy another way to foil them which I have used, is to put the clue in a <br/>
picture.  Here's one example I have out in the open:  <br/>
<a href="http://www.members.aol.com/nattybumppolbna/postcard.html" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.members.aol.com/nattybumppolbna/postcard.html</a><br/>
The words of the clue are part of the .jpg  not html so Google doesn't read them as words, <br/>
and thus , doesn't log them for search.<br/>
<br/>
Rather than delete the clues, you can move them and make Google link a dead link.  If you <br/>
rework the clue - perhaps renaming it in a subtle way - and then delete the original - it <br/>
will come up dead on Google.  Of course it will live on in other resources, but it should <br/>
keep out casual searchers - like your reporter.<br/>
<br/>
Of course, I don't advocate placing letterboxes in any place where they are illegal, <br/>
unauthorized or unwelcome.<br/>

<div>If a placer wants to give the hours of a location, they can just say that the box will be available during such and such hours, say that people should check on fees, etc, stuff like that. Depending on how well known the park or other location is, you could just give the location, or general location, or something it's near. I think there's lots of ways to sneak in what park a box is in without actually coming out and saying the name of it. You could say go to the intersection of such and such and go in the south entrance, go along high way such and such until you see such and such and turn left, stuff like that. </div>
