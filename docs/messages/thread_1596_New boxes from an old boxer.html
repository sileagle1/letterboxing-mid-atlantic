Subject: [lbma] New boxes from an old boxer<br/>
<br/>
Hi all,<br/>
well, I pretty much dropped out of the picture for a year while trying <br/>
to get re-employed.  Now that I am, I can relax a little (ha, I travel <br/>
4-5 days/week) or at least justify goofing off on the weekends.<br/>
 <br/>
So, I totally replaced the Evansburg Series today in Montgomery County <br/>
in PA.<br/>
For you out of towners, this is in the greater Philly area. North and <br/>
west of the city.<br/>
 <br/>
My kids had carved several Peanuts characters some time ago. I boxed <br/>
them up and went out with one kid and her friend.  The trail is muddy <br/>
and the course a little challenging.  Not for Hairy Leg people perhaps, <br/>
but small kids might need a hand on some of the steep hills.<br/>
 <br/>
So, even if you already logged this series before, these 4 are all <br/>
new.  Locations are all new.  I need to get proper documentaion into <br/>
the ranger there, but go for it.<br/>
Clues are posted.<br/>
