                    <div id="ygrps-yiv-2103702659">It looks like Elise and Tom's boxes are up for grabs, and currently <br/>
under my name on the site (a long story/accident I won't get into).  <br/>
Bev took "O be my Friend" and "70 Million Years Ago."  I wouldn't <br/>
mind holding onto the 2 Batsto boxes myself.  <br/>
<br/>
It sounds like Seashore is taking care of the "Cape May Point <br/>
Lighthouse" one (and was there mention of another box too?).  <br/>
Seashore, do you have a name on the lbna site that I can transfer the <br/>
clue(s) to?<br/>
<br/>
The boxes that don't have any claim on them as far as I know right <br/>
now are:<br/>
<br/>
Susquehanna<br/>
Delaware Bayshore Trio<br/>
Manasquan<br/>
Twice the Trouble<br/>
<br/>
Everyone, just drop me a line and I'll see that the boxes get <br/>
transfered to your name if you want any of them.  <br/>
