                    <div id="ygrps-yiv-1274195825">Hi, guys!  Sorry for the cross-post!  I was wondering if anyone had any <br/>
"wildflower" or "wildflower-themed" stamps (hand carved or commercial) <br/>
that they would allow me to borrow (I know!  Brazen, aren't I??!?) for <br/>
a short period of time.  I simply want to stamp some type of <br/>
wallhanging to encourage a local wildflower preserve to keep up the <br/>
good work.  (For those of you who are local, it is Bowman's Hill <br/>
Wildflower Preserve.)<br/>
<br/>
I do not intend to steal, eat, damage, plant, geocache, run over, run <br/>
off with or in any other way, shape, or form harm your stamp(s).  I <br/>
know the value of a stamp, both financially and (much more <br/>
importantly!) to its creator.  I simply want to make a nice wallhanging <br/>
for an organization that preserves an important slice of nature for <br/>
folks to enjoy.  (You can check out Bowman's Hill Wildflower Preserve's <br/>
website, if you like.)  And, I simply don't have the time right now to <br/>
carve a series of wildflower stamps, as much as I would love to do just <br/>
that!!!! :-)<br/>
<br/>
So that we don't have to worry about the USPS, I will foot the bill to <br/>
ship your stamp(s) to me via a traceable method (UPS, DHL, etc.) and I <br/>
will pay to return them to you via that same method.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for taking the time to read this and please let me know if you <br/>
have any stamps that you would be willing to lend.<br/>
<br/>
Blessings,<br/>
