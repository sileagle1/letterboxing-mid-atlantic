<br/>
If this Road Rally Thing Happens...  and I'm hoping it does...  I am going to need some <br/>
help.<br/>
<br/>
Like last year, I'd like to put the word out for carvers to donate stamps to the cause.  We <br/>
had some really beautiful work last year and I would hate to penalize the participants by <br/>
inflicting only my work on them.  So if anyone is interested in carving a stamp for the <br/>
Rally, please let me know.<br/>
<br/>
I was pleased with the results of the broad theme of "cars."  It gave us a great variety:  <br/>
everything from sculptured hood ornaments to political statements to action and <br/>
adventure and puzzles.  So I will leave that as the theme for this year's rally.<br/>
<br/>
If any of last year's stamps have not been planted elsewhere, they would also be welcome.<br/>
<br/>
Speaking of donations...  If you have a prize you would like to donate to the cause, please <br/>
contact me.  True Indigo and RGB were very gracious in (quite unexpectedly) donating <br/>
prizes to last year's rally and made the stamp prize and the Humanitarian award possible.<br/>
And no, that's not why they won.  <br/>
<br/>
I have come up with a way to open the rally up to more competitors this year.  My biggest <br/>
fear - which came to pass - was bunching up at boxes.  It's hardly fair to those who must <br/>
seek and find for others to just follow you in to the box.  Perhaps my new method will let <br/>
more people play and still keep it fair.<br/>
<br/>
Other developments for this year:<br/>
<br/>
No bullet-proof vests needed.<br/>
No tropical storms allowed.<br/>
More awards.<br/>
More devilry.<br/>
<br/>
If the folks who attended last year have any comments, criticisms suggestions please feel <br/>
free to contact me off-list so I may improve the event for this year.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
All the best,<br/>

park.  The bocxes could be layed out on a topo or orienteering map <br/>
where the contestants can choose any course they want.  Waaaaiiit, <br/>
that's called Orienteering, but with a boxing twist.  Mapsurfer told <br/>
me a few years ago that the DVOA (Delaware Valley Orienteering <br/>
Association) did something like this.  Fast hikers/walkers, good map <br/>
interpreters and/or fast stampers would do well in timed events.  <br/>
Perhaps an idea for an eeevil event, as I do own some bunny maps of a <br/>
favorite park in Berks/Chester Co. with lots of rocks and hills.<br/>
<br/>
Nat did an excellent job laying out the route and using standard road <br/>
rally instructions to get us to the locales, then used standard <br/>
letterboxing language to guide on to the box.<br/>

</span></blockquote>An interesting idea.  I wish I could come up with a better way,  but here are my concerns:<br/>
<br/>
My first and foremost concern for this is safety.  Anything having to do with driving cars is <br/>
just asking for trouble.  So I must balance my desire to let everyone play with reducing the <br/>
chances for mayhem.<br/>
<br/>
After driving the route many, many times last year I still got one of the directions wrong <br/>
on the instructions.  Go figure.  Despite otherwise good directions we still had missed <br/>
turns, U-turns, flat tires and other difficulties in the biggest rain storm of all time. <br/>
(perhaps an overstatement, but not by much)<br/>
<br/>
Mathematically, if we have 20 teams going for 8-10 boxes, it virtually guarantees <br/>
bunching up with a shotgun start.  And as great minds think alike, I believe that many <br/>
teams would pick the most efficient route and increase the bunch up.  In addition, if you <br/>
all leave at once, who will keep me company in my lonely, lonely cabin by the lake?<br/>
<br/>
I liked the way everybody had time to hang out and visit while waiting to go or waiting for <br/>
the teams to return.  It was fun to see people cheer the returning teams as they crossed <br/>
the finish line.<br/>
<br/>
MaryAnn, please don't feel I'm picking on you.  Quite a few people have expressed similar <br/>
concerns off-list.  I think I have a way for as many as 25 teams to play, and I think that is a <br/>
manageable number for me. If people can start earlier we can get more teams in, as we <br/>
have a hard out-time at the park.<br/>
<br/>
So stick with me.  If this way doesn't work, we may have to make it a TRUE Road Rally <br/>
where the competitors  must travel from a start point to an unknown destination by <br/>
directions alone.  Now THAT would be mayhem!<br/>

<br/>
In most road rallies, you are required to drive the speed limit, they <br/>
measure accuracy, not speed. This could be reinforced by something <br/>
like including in the clues "walk the same number of paces as the <br/>
number of minutes it took you to legally drive the speed limit from <br/>
point x to point y."<br/>

&gt; Hey, I saw nothing in the rules about not driving in reverse to take <br/>

&gt; <br/>
<br/>

</span></blockquote>Does that work?  I guess I got about 10,000 miles of reverse to do before I trade in my <br/>
van.<br/>
<br/>
Like a Road Rally, accuracy is favored over speed in this contest.<br/>
<br/>
Knowing the exact route and location of the letterboxes, I run the route prior to the rally.  <br/>
In theory, since I know where I am going, I should have the "perfect" time.  If someone <br/>
does it faster (in theory) they must be speeding or cheating.  The winner of the rally is the <br/>
team that comes closest without going UNDER the judges "perfect" time.  So you can go <br/>
fast if you like, but if you beat the judges, (or are observed speeding or driving illegally or <br/>
dangerously by our mysterious friend) you lose.<br/>
<br/>
Mileage was taken only to be used as a tie breaker, so spin your wheels all you want.<br/>
<br/>
As someone else noted, by the time the third or fourth crew got to the second-to-last box <br/>
last year, they didn't have to follow the complex compass headings, they just followed the <br/>
footsteps in the rain-soaked grass.   There will always be some unforeseen, unfair element <br/>
to this hybrid "sport."  So I will have to beg your forgiveness and remind you that if you are <br/>
only in it for the trophy, you might be missing the point of the game.  (Although they were <br/>
mighty fine trophies, if I do say so myself) <br/>
<br/>
I think we might be able to do as many as 20 teams this year.  I think more than that <br/>
might be unmanageable for many reasons.<br/>
