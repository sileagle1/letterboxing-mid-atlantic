but did you try joining the area talk list and posting there?  If not <br/>
to get a placer's response just to let the locals know.  Maybe some <br/>
have changed their e-ddress but didn't change it in LB.org (if that <br/>
can even be done??)  Heck, maybe they have moved cross country so <br/>
posting to LB.usa might get a response.  Besure to put the States <br/>
abrevs in the subject line on that site.<br/>
<br/>
But don't let this discourage you from continuing to make attempts to <br/>
contact placers.  Someone has to do it!  Heaven knows I'm a slacker'd <br/>
in that respect.  Although I always reply to those that have contacted <br/>
me (assuming their email hasn't gone straight to the JUNK box . . . <br/>
hey that's another possibility.  Maybe they only accept mail from <br/>
their known contacts??)<br/>

</span></blockquote>I don't even put my contact in the box.  I love reading comments about <br/>
my boxes, but unless there is a problem, don't ever expect a reponse <br/>
from me, particually a timely one.  It is nothing against anyone, I am <br/>
just that way.  I usually get backed up and send out a ton of replies <br/>
all at once, in one sitting.  I think alot of folks are just like that, <br/>
they feel if there is no problem, there is no reason to respond.<br/>
