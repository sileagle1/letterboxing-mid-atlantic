turned a dear friend into a raving letterboxer.<br/>
<br/>
Thursday we started w/ Carondolet Park - wet box, good<br/>
site.  We took the box home to dry out and add more<br/>
paper and a baggie then returned it promptly the next<br/>
AM. Also contacted the placer.<br/>
<br/>
That same evening I carved a stamp as a HH.<br/>
<br/>
Friday we grabbed another friend, also a new convert<br/>
and gathered 2 from Laumeier Sculpture Park, both in<br/>
great shape.  Gotta love St Louis with all their free<br/>
fun stuff!<br/>
<br/>
Then off to the zoo.  This box was well placed but<br/>
wetter than the first one and missing a stamp :-(  We<br/>
dried it as best we could and replaced it.  Gotta<br/>
contact that placer.<br/>
<br/>
Saturday we attempted and did not find Steuermann,<br/>
Rayburn Park Quickie, and PASP.  All 3 seemed like<br/>
questionable parks due to the amount of traffic. <br/>
Maybe we were just clueless and off track but I think<br/>
all 3 are missing.  Also good experience in<br/>
disappointment for the newbie!<br/>
<br/>
Finally, success w/ Mert's Dogwood and Blue Rink.  For<br/>
Blue Rink we were right behind another boxer - their<br/>
first box.  Someday I'll meet someone on the trail.<br/>
<br/>
Then off to the art museum where we happily found<br/>
Ever-Fixed Mark - fun clues.<br/>
<br/>
Total for the weekend - 1 release, 7 finds, 3 misses,<br/>
tons of fun.<br/>
