</span></blockquote>They're still being sent. If your email address starts bouncing back <br/>
to Yahoo Groups too much, you'll automatically be put on "bounced" <br/>
status (but that typically affects all of your group mail, including <br/>
this one). Also, since lbox-announce is a "distribution list only," <br/>
any reply to a list message will unsubscribe you -- so if you have an <br/>
auto-reply set up from your email address with one of those <br/>
out-of-the-office-on-vacation emails, that would get you kicked off. <br/>
