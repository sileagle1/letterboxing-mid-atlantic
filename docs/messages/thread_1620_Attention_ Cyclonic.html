</span></blockquote>I will try to get over there and check on it.  If you are feeling up to <br/>
it, just drop me a line and I will tell you where to meet us.<br/>
<br/>
I have contacted Mr Sapatkin and he seems very understanding of some of <br/>
the concerns some folks have (we have been through this before, right?). <br/>
  He did a story on Geocaching a few years ago, which he will forward it <br/>
to me, so he has an understanding of the hobby a bit.  Let not your <br/>
heart be troubled, this is a good thing.<br/>
