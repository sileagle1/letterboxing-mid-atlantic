worked with a friend to create our first letterboxes!  Check <br/>
out "Deep Run School" and "It Started with a Tavern" in Richmond, <br/>
VA!  What fun!!!<br/>
<br/>
I'm finding the information on this MB and other LB websites to be <br/>
great.  I love seeing the variety of ways to do clues and how <br/>
creative everyone is!<br/>
<br/>
Mother Earth and I (Art z Mom)are both girl scout leaders and have <br/>
introduced our troop to it as well as other leaders, so Richmond <br/>
will be crawling with newbie letterboxers for a while!  We took a <br/>
group of girl scout leaders out to find the Pouncey Tract box in <br/>
Richmond, Va today.  We performed some maintenance and picked up <br/>
trash along the way, trying to be conscientious letterboxers... <br/>
added new log book and fresh ziplocks.<br/>
<br/>
Just wanted to share my enthusiasm and tell everyone that this has <br/>
been a joy for us and our families!<br/>
