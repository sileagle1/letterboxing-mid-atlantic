had pulled my box#1, in the "Cops and Robbers: Kidknapped" series of <br/>
3.  I origionally went to check on box, and was unable to replace, as <br/>
a nature photographer was taking pictures of the birds and trees <br/>
nearby..After delaying as long as I could, I was unable to out-wait <br/>
the guy..thus i took it, and my dog with me...Turns out 2 boxers went <br/>
looking for it that day, and wasnt able to replace till recently..<br/>
<br/>
Well it is now replaced, and ready for finders...sorry for not posting <br/>
it!.....<br/>
