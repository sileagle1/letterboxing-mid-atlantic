I will have a variety of beverages available for all. As long as we don't get to drunk and rowdy and start a rousing game of naked fire jumping (which my caving club really does, not kidding. we even wrote a drinking song about it!) we should be cool.</div> <div>Â </div> <div>Nope, no special stmaps. There really is no need, plus I am too lazy. There are so many wonderful stamps all with an hour that the campground will act as "base camp" for everyone to return to and relax and share trail stories after a day full of letterboxing. <br/><br/><b><i>BullDawg &lt;bulldawgva@...&gt;</i></b> wrote:</div> <blockquote><span title="qreply"> <blockquote class="ygrps-yiv-1600748888replbq" style="PADDING-LEFT:5px;MARGIN-LEFT:5px;BORDER-LEFT:#1010ff 2px solid;"><tt>whose bringing the beers!?<br/><br/>and are any special stamps being planted on the campground for the <br/>event?...maybe i can get a few up there, and send clues to irene for
