&gt; Hello,<br/>
&gt;    <br/>
&gt;   Yesterday, my 9 year-old son and 12 year-old daughter joined me <br/>
for a climb up to Old Schloss, in very rural Shenandoah County.  <br/>
Unfortunately, both of these boxes (Guardian of Old Schloss and Wolf <br/>
Gap) seem to be missing.<br/>
&gt;    <br/>
&gt;   But it is a spectacular hike, if you are so inclined.  And it <br/>
could sorely stand some letterboxes up there, which I'll think about <br/>
if I ever recover.  4.4 miles round trip--2.5 hours up, 1 hour down.<br/>
&gt;    <br/>
&gt;   I wouldn't bring any younger children, though.  The views, and <br/>
the drop-offs, are spectacular.<br/>
&gt;    <br/>
&gt;   Also, Iron Furnace at the Elizabeth Furnace area near Front <br/>
Royal, VA, has only had one finder outside of my family (thank you <br/>
Cyclonic).  It's a great place to spend a few family hours, and <br/>
plenty of trails nearby in need of more boxes. Easy to find, too.<br/>
&gt;    <br/>
&gt;   Thanks,<br/>
&gt;   FamilyMan<br/>

Yep, sorry about that, I just got notice recently that Big Schloss Box <br/>
was missing, so I've pulled the clues. ( From LB.org and AQ and <br/>
poisonivy.150m.com/letterbox.htm )<br/>
<br/>
The hike IS strenuous but the view is equally fabulous.<br/>
<br/>
It's ripe for boxes now though.</div>
