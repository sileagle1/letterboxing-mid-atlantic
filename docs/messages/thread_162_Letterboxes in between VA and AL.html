We're going to Alabama this weekend.  We're taking the Blue Ridge <br/>

State Oark in Kingsport, NC.  We'll then get on 81 and go to <br/>
Chattanooga, and then to Birmingham.  Any suggestions would be <br/>
greatly appreciated.<br/>

</span></blockquote>The Roanoke Star was a nice spot and as easy walk once you found your <br/>
way to the top of the hill.  We were not able to find Chattanooga <br/>
Choo Choo or See Rock City.  Did not get a responce from the placer <br/>
to see if boxes were MIA or if we just did not look well enough.  <br/>
Might try contacting the placer before going.<br/>
