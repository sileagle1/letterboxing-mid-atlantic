Turn signals will give away your next move. A confident New Jersey Driver avoids using them.<br/> <br/>2. Under no circumstance should you maintain a safe distance between you and the car in front of you, because the space will be filled in by somebody else, putting you in an even more dangerous situation.<br/> <br/>3. The faster you drive through a red light, the less chance you have of getting hit.<br/> <br/>4. WARNING!
 Never come to a complete stop at a stop sign. No one expects it and it will result in your being rear-ended.<br/> <br/>5. Never get in the way of an older car that needs extensive bodywork, especially with PA, NY or DE plates. With no insurance, the other operator probably has nothing to lose.<br/> <br/>6. Braking is to be done as hard and late as possible to ensure that your ABS kicks in, giving a vigorous, foot massage as the brake pedal violently pulsates. For those of you without ABS, it's a chance to strengthen your leg muscles.<br/> <br/>7. Never pass on the left when you can pass on the right.

Speed limits are arbitrary figures; given only as a suggestion and are not enforceable in New Jersey during rush hour.<br/> <br/>9 Just because you're in the left lane and have no room to speed up or move over doesn't mean that a New York driver

I have to admit, it is counter-intuitive to move to the right to turn <br/>
left. They should rephrase the signage:<br/>
"All Turns - Right Lane<br/>
Yes, all of them, even the left turns.<br/>
We really mean it.<br/>
This means you, Irene"<br/>
Traffic circles are great on smaller, local roads, but useless on <br/>
highways of more than two lanes. What I hate is the double d thingy <br/>
where one road is shoved through the middle of a former circle and <br/>
they put in two lights.<br/>
