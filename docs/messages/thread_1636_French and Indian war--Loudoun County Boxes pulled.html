box as this was a thread a while back. I post the update here.<br/>
<br/>
 I suppose I should comment/update on the "Loudoun County Letterboxes <br/>
pulled" thread of a month or so ago. I met with the Park manager a <br/>
while back after she contacted me that she pulled all of my boxes and <br/>
those of Bulldawg's. She has pulled boxes from ADG and DJ2 in the <br/>
past. At the meeting she expressed her concerns with boxes being in <br/>
sensitive areas in the park. A main point was just that she was not <br/>
informed of the boxes. She also has 2 sanctioned geocaches which are <br/>
not working out due to cachers coming in after hours and bushwhacking <br/>
into the woods from the road and at night. A sheriff's deputy <br/>
followed 2 cachers into the woods one night about a month a go and <br/>
just about arrested them until their story was explained and park <br/>
management was notified. They were lucky. The manager's policy right <br/>
now is to allow the single letterbox. Any other boxes found will be <br/>
pulled and the placer notified. She reads the logs and if any finds <br/>
indicate the boxer was in after hours or on holidays, the box and <br/>
it's contents are destroyed. She monitors the LBNA site regularly <br/>
(which is how we got snagged), and has met with a council of park <br/>
managers in northern virginia to inform them how to moniter for <br/>
letterboxes. She did indicate that some managers were not overly <br/>
worried, but most just did not know about boxing. <br/>
   She had indicated to Bulldawg and I that she would consider <br/>
a "sanctioned " letterbox. I met with her and proposed a box that <br/>
would promote either the historic or nature aspect of the park. My <br/>
plan was,and is, to have a sanctioned box which Pam, the park <br/>
manager, assists in planting. We actually hiked for the plant <br/>
together.  I then suggested that the clues be only available at the <br/>
visitor center and they be numbered so that the amount of traffic to <br/>
the box can be monitored. This way the box casn be moved if there is <br/>
too much traffic to the site which is off trail. She became very <br/>
enthusiastic about the project and has printed out a nice brochure <br/>
for the clues. She is also having the park's web site updated to list <br/>
letterboxing as one of the "programs". The brochure also gives some <br/>
letterboxing "rules" and etiquette, so new boxers can be given a good <br/>
start. The box is limited ( this one for about a year) at which point <br/>
it will be retired and I will make new one with a different theme and <br/>
clues. <br/>
  Future boxes will be for less amount of time. This one is out <br/>
longer due to it being the anniversary year of the French and Indian <br/>
War, and the park has a number of activities planned with that theme <br/>
including a re-enactment. <br/>
   It worked out great. I get to plant boxes "legally", and she gets <br/>
a new family activity to promote the park. I hope this is a stepping <br/>
stone to allowing for 1 or 2 more boxes at the park. <br/>
                      Safe trails,<br/>
