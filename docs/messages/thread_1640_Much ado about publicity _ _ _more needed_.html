                    <div id="ygrps-yiv-860519237">I checked out the Philadelphia Inquirer article and it looks very<br/>
positive. It will be interesting to see if there is an influx of new<br/>
people as a result. Recalling the delayed negative reaction to the<br/>
National Public Radio spot I'm curious if there are complaints <br/>
looming about this recent publicity. I wonder if we don't need <br/>
another such article in the Washington Post. In my humble opinion <br/>
there seems a disproportionate letterboxing population around the <br/>
Northern Virginia area. At last Fall's "Mystery... A Fall Gather" <br/>
held in our own NoVa backyard, the Va/Md/DC area letterboxers were <br/>
greatly outnumbered by letterboxers who travelled 100 miles or more <br/>
to be there... more than two-to-one.<br/>
<br/>
Is it just me? I don't get a sense that letterboxing is "thriving"<br/>
here. There seems a very small number of people active. The few that<br/>
are active are placing lots of good letterboxes. But many of these<br/>
boxes sit unfound for months or years. It seems just a very few <br/>
people<br/>
are placing and finding each others letterboxes. Is this healthy? On<br/>
the other hand, I literally stumble over geocaches &amp; geocachers all<br/>
the time.</div>

<div>I tend to agree with HnH. Though I would like to see more activity out in 
my area (Loudoun County), I am now getting e-mail updates weekly, on my boxes 
out here. Surely activity is increasing. GR is right; there are a lot 
of cachers, but this is precisely why letterboxes were being pulled at the 
Claude Moore Park in Sterling. Cachers were causing damage and bushwhacking too 
much. Now I am able to plant a box there, by permission, and get in a bit of 
education on the hobby as new people see this activity at the park. I am 
hoping that the manager sees the "kinder, gentler" side of boxing, and more 
boxes will be allowed there in the future.</div>
<div>   I'm in no rush for a throng of letterboxers. Newspaper 
articles can cause this, though articles can be good if proper oversight is 
given. I think gradual increase in the community yields better boxers. When 
there is a rush of newbies, is when I see boxes planted poorly and land owners 
and park management getting ruffled.</div>

finds. Thats great! I didn't know that was the case. I know I spent <br/>
a lot of times hunting yours and Bulldawg's boxes out there. But <br/>
there are boxes here, in the counties south of the beltway  that <br/>
have not been found at all or not been found for years... or found <br/>
only once....<br/>
<br/>
Yesterday I did find a box within ten miles of my home placed by new <br/>
letterboxers I don't know and frankly it's exciting. I've not seen <br/>
them stamped in anywhere before. This is very rare for me to see <br/>
someone new on the scene here.<br/>
<br/>
I think Knights of Colombo, Doubtful Guests, Sewsowbusy, <br/>
Schitzokeet&amp; Disclava and myself are the only letterboxers that <br/>
regularly go out and hunt letterboxes in the Fairfax, &amp; Prince <br/>
William County...  thats eight letterboxers out of nearly two <br/>
million in population.<br/>
<br/>
I realize there are a few people out there that will letterbox <br/>
without chatting here, arranging trail meetings or attending <br/>
events... and thats perfectly valid... but I would like for my local <br/>
boxes to get found more frequently... (I think Bulldawg would too) <br/>
and for that to happen there needs to be a few more people actually <br/>
letterboxing.<br/>

letterboxed longer than myself... and from your HnH HQ more than 100 <br/>
miles away. There are lots and lots of very cool boxes in the <br/>
area... (many I've yet to even look for!)but  I'm suggesting they <br/>
are not getting many visitors. Maybe I'm way off target.... What's <br/>
the national average of visitors logged per year of a typical <br/>

<div>
<div>I'm not going to get into the whole publicity thing because I've already made my feelings known and don't feel the need to keep repeating myself, but as far as boxes sitting unfound for months or years is concerned, one also has to take into account each box, the clues, the location. Some boxers make their boxes hard to get to, or make the clues difficult because they don't ::want:: a lot of traffic. I can see "many" boxes going unfound for months, but are there really "many" that go unfound for years? I don't know. I just don't get that feeling. Mind you, this is coming from someone who doesn't get out of NYC to go boxing anywhere else often enough to know your area. But I just don't get that feeling. </div>

<div>I see that there are now 2,808 members on the USA list and though I make a point to stay away from it most of the time, when I do look at it, there are always new members. ::::::::Always:::::::::, without exception. When I found out about boxing in April of 2004, there were I think about 1600. That's growth. Growth is healthy. The people I know and read posts from on all the groups are enthusiastic about boxing. This is healthy. I think the hobby is alive and well and growing. I don't know if you can define the health or lack of it by boxing traffic in one area in any one given period of time. </div>
<div> </div>
<div><font face="Courier New">"William County...thats eight letterboxers out of nearly two <br/>million in population</font>"</div>
<div> </div>
<div>I just saw your new note come up and looked at it. I don't think you can judge the health of the hobby by comparing the number of boxes to the area's population of two million. I don't think the health of letterboxing should be defined by it's size or lack of it, by numbers or lack of them. I think it needs to be defined by the quality of the people who box, they way they box, and the fact that it is indeed growing. And if you take two million and say that you want.............I don't know, hundreds or thousands of people out boxing on a given weekend in one area,  I think the quality of the hobby will suffer greatly. </div>
<div> </div>
<div>As long as boxing is growing, and I think it's pretty obvious it is, for whatever reason, publicity, WOM or whatever, I think that indicates health. I could compare the small number of boxes here, most of which are mine, to our population of over 8 million, but I don't think it applies. I think boxing is doing just fine. After all, size isn't always important. &lt;eg&gt; </div>

<div>With all due respect, I think you are off target. I just don't think that is what letterboxing is about......the national average of visitors to a typical box. No one knows and I don't think anyone really cares that much. I just don't think this is a numbers kind of hobby, if you know what I mean. It's an artistic and creative hobby. Kind of an offbeat, folk art kind of hobby. I think the very fact that we are having this conversation shows that the hobby is healthy, because we have this interest and these opinions, different though they seem to be. If no one was posting and no one had any opinions, then I would start to worry.</div>

<div>GR, Though I love the traffic to my boxes, I have no expectations of that 
to continue. I think all boxers have a different "view" as to what they want out 
of the hobby. I have different traffic expectations to my local boxes than I do 
to my more "extreme" boxes. Like Bulldawg, I prefer longer more physically 
challenging boxes than shorter "kid friendly ones" if I am boxing alone. But, 
because I hike regularly, what I view as a long, challenging hike 
for a box will differ from Bulldawg's perspective. If I am with the family, I 
keep it to shorter boxes, but also have to stay close by the house to keep a 3 
and 5 year old from losing complete interest before I even get to a box a county 
or two away. Some are really into their PFX count, others, like myself, no 
longer count. It's all good.</div>
<div>    I think what you are saying, is that you want more 
frequent traffic to your boxes.  Many share that feeling. This is 
what can cause frustration in the hobby at times. Think of it like 
fishing...every once in a while you'll be interrupted by actually catching one. 
I just don't think an influx of new boxers is the answer. At best, you would get 
a temporary rush in traffic then have it fade again. The problem would be that 
the influx could lead to boxers with poor habits and etiquette due to a 
rush to get active in the hobby. </div>
<div>   I don't think you should question if you are "on target." The 
hobby evolves because we post our thoughts on how it is working. I used to be 
frustrated with how the hobby was gaining in popularity. I worked that out by 
just adapting my boxes to how I want it played. I have some that are going with 
the flow, and others that...well, they are less so. Keep the faith Rogue, the 
hobby is growing....faster than some of us want. I bid you all safe 
trails.</div>

yea...you are a marathon hiker with those 10+ mile ones.....Im still <br/>
training on these 4-5 miles trails..No worry, Ill be ready for those <br/>
long ones soon.....More than even the hike length, is the goal of a <br/>
view, or something origional about a trail..to make it different, <br/>
and not repetitive..kinda wanna take boxers to my boxes, and reward <br/>
then with something more than a box..but a journey, peace of mind, <br/>
or even a life changing experience.....<br/>
<br/>
the box is secondary<br/>

People fascinate, infuriate, baffle and thrill me. I am constantly interested in different thought processes. I guess being a trainer and working in the adult learning environment has something to do with it. I teach adults all day long. And they are all so very different, that's what I like best about it. They each bring their own skill set and need set to the table. What training method works for one may not work for another. Alot of it has to do with IQ and innate skills. But an equal portion has to do with thier mental processes. What do they need and how do they need it to finaaly learn and retian what I am trying to teach them? I often have to figure that out. So I am fascinated with people and the way they think. And how people can perceive the same event, or
 information completely differently.

Hi June.  If you are posting/emailing from an aol account, it may be <br/>

<br/>
After Poison Ivy's pub crawl and subsequent searches<br/>
of the area I'm looking forward to gettting back to<br/>
that area.  There are some very talented carvers,<br/>
beautiful parks, and a neat town to explore.  Without<br/>
attending the pub crawl I probably wouldn't have<br/>
thought about visiting, despite the number of placed<br/>
boxes.<br/>
<br/>
Also, I've made a couple of converts in recent travels<br/>
and try to include time in travel plans for<br/>
letterboxing.  I'm fortunate that most of my friends<br/>
like to hike - boxing is a bonus.<br/>
<br/>
Everything in my area seems to get pretty heavy,<br/>
regular traffic.  I'm looking forward to boxing in<br/>
Wash DC this coming weekend and going downstate later<br/>
this summer.<br/>
<br/>
Perhaps as more people exhaust their areas they will<br/>
be more willing to venture out and explore new towns.<br/>
<br/>
As for 'too much traffic' and etiquetteless newbies,<br/>
it's one of the reasons my first carvings have yet to<br/>
be released.  I like Koyote's long hike idea.  Maybe a<br/>
mid-range hike.  I want them to be found but I'm<br/>
afraid to relinquish control.<br/>

<div>GR, Though I love the traffic to my boxes, I have no
expectations of that to continue. I think all boxers have a different
"view" as to what they want out of the hobby. I have different traffic
expectations to my local boxes than I do to my more "extreme" boxes.
Like Bulldawg, I prefer longer more physically challenging boxes than
shorter "kid friendly ones" if I am boxing alone. But, because I hike
regularly, what I view as a long, challenging hike for a box will
differ from Bulldawg's perspective. If I am with the family, I keep it
to shorter boxes, but also have to stay close by the house to keep a 3
and 5 year old from losing complete interest before I even get to a box
a county or two away. Some are really into their PFX count, others,
like myself, no longer count. It's all good.</div>
<div>    I think what you are saying, is that you want more frequent
traffic to your boxes.  Many share that feeling. This is what can cause
frustration in the hobby at times. Think of it like fishing...every
once in a while you'll be interrupted by actually catching one. I just
don't think an influx of new boxers is the answer. At best, you would
get a temporary rush in traffic then have it fade again. The problem
would be that the influx could lead to boxers with poor habits and
etiquette due to a rush to get active in the hobby. </div>
<div>   I don't think you should question if you are "on target." The
hobby evolves because we post our thoughts on how it is working. I used
to be frustrated with how the hobby was gaining in popularity. I worked
that out by just adapting my boxes to how I want it played. I have some
that are going with the flow, and others that...well, they are less so.
Keep the faith Rogue, the hobby is growing....faster than some of us
want. I bid you all safe trails.</div>
