happened before and eventually gets back to normal. Has anyone else had <br/>
this problem? We had checked our Kids Castle box on Friday not knowing <br/>
Cyclonic and reporter had been there. Box was rehidden well and we <br/>
replaced outer baggie. The woods seem so bare and open at this time of <br/>
year. <br/>
