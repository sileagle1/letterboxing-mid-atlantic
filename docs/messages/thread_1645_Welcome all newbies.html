<br/>
But, what if we all carved a stamp to donate to them in honor of <br/>
their 50th?  Anyone up for that?  <br/>
<br/>
I don't know if there are that many hiding places in the park, but <br/>
certainly in the area there might be.  I don't know how hard it would <br/>
be to get 50 stamps and 50 hiding places, but perhaps they'd be <br/>
interested in planting some after the festivities?<br/>
<br/>
Just an idea- what do you all think? <br/>
