                    <div id="ygrps-yiv-161727989">Hi all!  I've joined this group temporarily to ask a question about <br/>
letterboxes in Philadelphia.  My GF and I are travelling to Philly <br/>
for the Independence Day weekend.  Although I've been to Philly a <br/>
number of times, my GF hasn't spent any time there, and thus we'll be <br/>
doing a lot of the traditional tourist things during the day.<br/>
<br/>
We have both discovered letterboxing over the last few weeks, and <br/>
would enjoy finding a couple of Philadelphia letterboxes while were <br/>
there, although (as aluded to) our time available to letterbox will <br/>
be short.  I figure that once museums, etc. close, we may have some <br/>
time in the evenings, or, if we have enough energy, early mornings.<br/>
<br/>
I'm aware of some letterboxes in Philly from the LbNA database, <br/>
specifically:<br/>
* The three Space Traveler boxes in Wissahickon Park.<br/>
* The 5-box Ben Franklin Series<br/>
* The Eastern State Peniteniary letterbox<br/>
* America's First Zoo letterbox<br/>
<br/>
We're most intrigued by the Ben Franklin series, but wish to know how <br/>
realistic it is to find some or all of these boxes for a weekend <br/>
traveller staying in the city without a car.  We'll be staying at the <br/>
Club Quarters in Independence Park.<br/>
<br/>
I think we're planning to go to the Eastern State Peniteniary anyway, <br/>
so we'll look for that one, but having more than one would be nice!<br/>
<br/>
Is the Ben Franklin series possible for our scenario?  Can it be done <br/>
after hours (evenings or even at night)?  Lastly (and most <br/>
important), does anyone know the status of these boxes?  Given the <br/>
time constraints, we certainly do not want to hunt for boxes that are <br/>
MIA!<br/>
<br/>
Many thanks!<br/>

<br/>
</span></blockquote>Those boxes are all there, but as for not having a car..don't know. <br/>
It'd be a LONG walk or bike ride. And I don't know how you'd get <br/>
there without a car, other than SEPTA, but as an out-of-towner you <br/>
probably don't want to use public transport. I wouldn't get these at <br/>
night, either...some parts of the park (lower than where I placed the <br/>
boxes, but they're still part of the park) can be pretty dangerous at <br/>
night.<br/>
<br/>
I'd go for the Wissahickon Park ones - you can walk to all 3, and <br/>
they're a nice walk :)<br/>
<br/>
There's also one in the Manayunk section of Philadelphia, accessible <br/>
by the R6 Norristown train, called "Boards and Bridges".<br/>

BUT, if I have to leave my home city's celebration, Philadelphia is <br/>
probably the only other place I'd consider (maybe D.C. -- but that's <br/>
it!)  We're looking forward to it!<br/>
