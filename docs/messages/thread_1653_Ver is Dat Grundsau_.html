<br/>
Der vas a major kerfaffle at the Fersommling of Grundsau Lodsch <br/>
nummer zwolf.  It seems zat da prize Grunsau, Goschenhoppen Gus has <br/>
gone missing.  Lets go looken now to see vat is transpiring<br/>
<br/>
"Chentlemen and Ladies!  Please settle dahn!"  sag der Haaptman as <br/>
he tried to calm down the attendants.<br/>
<br/>
But der shouting continued<br/>
<br/>
"But, Goschenhoppen Gus is missing!  We fear he has been kidnapped!  <br/>
Who could do such a ding?," came exasperated replies from the <br/>
worried guests.<br/>
<br/>
"Vat ve know is that a certain Mr. Pujeh vas seen out by the den <br/>
running away vit some of dat der Douggerware.  Maybe he's going to <br/>
hide a letterbox or some other such ding"<br/>
<br/>
"Ach!  Dat Pujeh's nothing but trouble.  First schkams, then dose <br/>
aufful Rottingtons and nah dis!  Day say dat a man is chudged by der <br/>
company he keeps  hounds, hikers, big and little dawgs, people dat <br/>
play vit crayons assorted coaster riders and vultures  a most <br/>
unsavory lot!"<br/>
<br/>
"so, ver do you dink der Grundsau is?"<br/>
<br/>
"Vell, I hope dat he at least hid it in Pennsylvaanisch-Deitsch <br/>
country, maybe in Baerricks or Lechaa Kaundi!"<br/>
<br/>
"Grundsaus like deh vatter, I dink it is by der Lake zwichen det <br/>
tahships dat mean "Little Daughter" in der Lenape tongue and "der <br/>
Maiden Creek"<br/>
<br/>
"Ay, dat ver all dat Urban Schprawl is creeping.  At least the <br/>
forest about der Lake is safe, ve hope!"<br/>
<br/>
"Dat's bettur.  I did find dis schlip of peper by der den.  Vot does <br/>
it mean?"<br/>
<br/>
"It looks like directions to der platz."<br/>
<br/>
Route 222 southwest from Kutztown.  Turn right on route 73.  After <br/>
about ½ mile turn right onto Calcium Road and finally right onto <br/>
Maiden Creek Road.  Go to the second very small dirt parking lot on <br/>
the left, about ½ mile.  If you see a stop sign along a woods road <br/>
heading northwest of here park there"<br/>
<br/>
"Ach, vunscht, that shlip is in Inglisch.  Well dat Pujeh is no <br/>
Dutchmann!  Ve need to bring an Inglishman or der Raadsman along vor <br/>
dat shtuff..."<br/>
<br/>
"Say nah vunscht, I know dat platz!  Chust vest of the Grossdaddi <br/>
Lodsch.  Und calcium is good for dah bones!"<br/>
<br/>
"Let's go organize a posse and go out and find our Grundsau."<br/>
<br/>
"You know vat?  I dink ve can find our Grundsau.  Let us hurry to <br/>
der!"<br/>
<br/>
"Yes, but ven you leave, don't forget to Outten the Lights!"<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Several Volunteers including der Haaptman, der Raadsman, der Parre <br/>
and the rest of the Raatsleit gathered up there things and went <br/>
forth to where the slip of paper directed them<br/>
<br/>
"Vell, here ve are.  Maiden Creek Road and look der goes dat woods <br/>
road at 330° and der is a Shtop sign right by dose train tracks.  I <br/>
am glad I brought dis compash."<br/>
<br/>
"Yah, let us go dere and cross the tracks and go on for about <br/>
another ¼ mile"<br/>
<br/>
"Say Nah!  Vat is dat?  A tree shtump vit a big wart on it?  Vat an <br/>
awful ding to happen top a tree.  Maybe dat's vy it broke off and <br/>
ders a suspicious pile of log log fragments at dah base."<br/>
<br/>
"Ach you Dumn Bunny!  You only found his tracks!  I dink ve need to <br/>
go much further down this path."<br/>
<br/>
"I say ve keep going down this road, and be sure to ignore dem side <br/>
roads.  Besides valking up dat little hill will be good exercise!"<br/>
<br/>
"Yah Kistler, you could shtand to lose a few pounds!!"<br/>
<br/>
"Very funny, Hunsicker, you're no Slim Jim yourself!"<br/>
<br/>
"Gentlemen, Please!  Ve do haff a  Grudsau to find.  Shtay focused!"<br/>
<br/>
"Vell we're at the last cross roads, only down the hill a bit from <br/>
here is the lake."  "<br/>
<br/>
"I dink there is a little pine forest half vay down on der right"<br/>
<br/>
"Looky der! On der left across from der little pine forest  A large <br/>
root ball."<br/>
<br/>
"Look vunscht behind at and see if it is there!"<br/>
<br/>
"I see a suspicious pile of logs and vait!  Der it is!!!"<br/>
<br/>
That evening, when returning to the Lodsch, them members celebrated <br/>
finding Die Grundsau and his tracks by eating a wonderful feast <br/>
complete with Garoschde Sie um Rins Fleesche (pork and beef), <br/>
sauergraut, dunges (gravy), Salaat mit Seida Schpech Brie (lettuce <br/>
with bacon dressing), Gchtumpde Grumbiera (mashed potatoes), <br/>
Welschkarn (corn), Bendel Bohna (string beans), Zellerich and Geel <br/>
Reeva (celery and carrots), Schmier kaes um Lodwarrich (cottage <br/>
cheese and applebutter), Weis um karn brot (white and rye bread), <br/>
Budder (butter) and of course Gfrorne Raahm (ice cream) for dessert. <br/>
Coffee was available during the meal but a toast was offered using <br/>
Gens Wei (goose wine) that suspiciously tasted like a brew made with <br/>
leaves from tea that grows randomly in meadows and gardens!</div>
