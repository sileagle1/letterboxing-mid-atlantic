Virginia boxes, I abandoned a planned butt-breaker of a hike in George <br/>
Washington National Forest for a day of boxing in Rogue's neck of the <br/>
woods (Dude, what is up with the multi-tray tupperware for a single <br/>
stamp?:) ) . Very busy trails kept my Kanine Kaper to 13 boxes. I <br/>
spread the boxing love by leaving a couple of WOMs in a coupole of the <br/>
boxes. Also found a long lost box from the archives alive and well! I <br/>
gave up around 3:30 afer waiting for yet another group of hikers pass <br/>
by a box. I had retraced trail too many times to avoid hikers to keep <br/>
hunting. Still, nice trails and saw the most turtles I have ever seen <br/>
in one place! Will contact all placers to update status. Lovely area <br/>
for boxing, especially for the younger boxers. Hope to get back soon <br/>
for the rest of the boxes I want to get. Thanks Rougue!! Safe trails<br/>

Next time you are over here ... drop me a line and I 'll walk with <br/>
you. Re: Crowded Trail... The Cemetery Loop Trail is longer and less <br/>
travelled since it is on the opposite side of the refuge from the <br/>
Education Center.<br/>
<br/>
FYI... you were North of the Occoquan River in both areas where you <br/>
boxed....(Fairfax County)... Why don't you come back and we'll walk <br/>
Prince William Forest... there is a ranger approved series and there <br/>
and it's more of a challenge.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for thinking of me!<br/>
