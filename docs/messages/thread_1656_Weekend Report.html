screws up the alliteration)<br/>
<br/>
I highly recommend True Indigo's Londonderry Air.  A fun evening's clue solving around a <br/>
laptop with a couple of bottles of good merlot.  I was buying tickets to Ireland before I <br/>
figured out where it was.  [BTW  Don't drink and netsurf.  You might not remember what you <br/>
did, but the credit cards will]<br/>
<br/>
As always, beautiful stamps.<br/>
<br/>
Also found my first Silent Dougger as well.<br/>
<br/>
Now I remember why we do this!  It's been a long winter, folks.<br/>
