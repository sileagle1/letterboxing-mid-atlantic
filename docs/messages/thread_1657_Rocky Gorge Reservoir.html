<br/>
For a few months I have been working on the series of boxes planted <br/>
at Rocky Gorge Reservoir (Laurel/Scaggsville, Md.) in 2002 by <br/>
aweehedgehog and dewlovers. Of the eight boxes listed at LBNA, I <br/>
have now found five, safe and sound and in good shape. They have not <br/>
had much traffic over the years, but they are to be recommended.<br/>
<br/>
Some notes:<br/>
You'll have to be a bit of an archaeologist; many of the landmarks <br/>
are now altered or disappeared---but things can be worked out.<br/>
<br/>
Both "Scotts Cove" boxes survive, as do all three "Supplee Lane at <br/>
Rocky Gorge Reservoir" boxes.<br/>
<br/>
The three that have been giving me fits make up the series "Rocky <br/>
Gorge Reservoir." Again, the landmarks can no longer be found; I am <br/>
fairly certain I've been in the right locations, but all three have <br/>
eluded me.<br/>
<br/>
I don't *think* either placer is still in the game, but I could be <br/>
wrong about that. Has anyone found or attempted these three boxes <br/>
recently and could share insights?<br/>
<br/>
Many thanks, and if you get out this way, I think you'll enjoy the <br/>
challenge of finding the five boxes that I know still remain!<br/>

My next "older boxes" challenge is Chessie Lover's early 2003 <br/>
Riverfront Park Series of nine boxes in Laurel on the other side of <br/>
the Duckett Dam. I've negotiated the four "Easter Bunny Trail" boxes <br/>
(with mixed results), but "The Dam Trail" five boxes are a real <br/>
challenge, involving some very faint trails, bushwhacking, steep <br/>
slopes, "jumping a ravine" and so on. I set out to try them but was <br/>
intimidated by the very first of the steep slopes! Any info on the <br/>
shape these boxes are in would be appreciated. Has anyone attempted <br/>
them recently?<br/>

I found these 3 waaay back on 3/9/03 and probably the only reason I <br/>
did find them was because I was following the intrepid Dead Duck <br/>
Chuck through foot-deep snow. It wouldn't surprise me if the <br/>
landmarks have changed drastically because a tornado touched down <br/>
there in June 2003 (we had gone back to find box #3 of the Supplee <br/>
Lane series and had to crawl over/around lots of downed trees.<br/>
<br/>
We found both Riverfront Park series on 5/1/03. I thought the Easter <br/>
Bunny series washed away in subsequent flooding. (Uh, I'm sensing a <br/>
pattern of natural disaster here...).<br/>
<br/>
Thank you for checking up on these boxes. I don't think the placers <br/>
are active in letterboxing these days. Feel free to email me if you <br/>
think I can be of any help (<a href="mailto:donnas28@..." rel="nofollow" target="_blank">donnas28@...</a>).<br/>

We found both boxes of Scott's Cove in January of 2005. That same day <br/>
we found boxes #2 and #3 in the Rocky Gorge Reservoir series after a <br/>
bit of a hike around the reservoir. We tried for at least 1/2 hour on <br/>
Box #1 and finally gave up. <br/>

                    <div id="ygrps-yiv-804413317">Thanks to both Whisper Foot and Martini Man. Both boxers who have <br/>
stamped in before me on many a box in Maryland. That must have been <br/>
some whirlwind tour you took in 2004, MM---your stamps are everywhere <br/>
in logs!<br/>
<br/>
Re the "Dam Trail" boxes, I had the same feeling you did, MM---that it <br/>
would not be wise to attempt them. It just did not look like there was <br/>
any kind of real trail there, I had only gone 1 for 4 on the "Easter <br/>
Bunny Trail" and being so close downstream to the Duckett Dam really <br/>
did make me feel like it would be trespassing, what with 9-11 concerns <br/>
about dams, this being the D.C. metro area, and everything. I didn't <br/>
even get far enough along to see the "no tresspassing" signs and I <br/>
felt that way. I know the Duckett Dam (which you can see from I-95) <br/>
has recently been listed as one that authorities are especially <br/>
keeping an eye on.<br/>
<br/>
As you wrote, it just didn't seem like a good idea at the time.<br/>

                    <div id="ygrps-yiv-1739814219">Also many thanks to you Donna! You are right about the penchant for <br/>
natural disaster in this area. I work at the Univ of Md and live in <br/>
Columbia, so the day the tornado came through in 2003 I drove home <br/>
right along its path while it was going through. Between the flooding <br/>
along the Patuxent (detrimental to the Easter Bunny Trail) and the <br/>
downed trees in the reservoir area, I live in a real weather magnet.<br/>
<br/>
Let me also say that box 1 of the Easter Bunny Trail lives! So if <br/>
you'd like to stamp a piece of history and you're in the Laurel area, <br/>
there you go!<br/>
<br/>
Also, I am looking forward to getting to some of your boxes "out west" <br/>
this coming spring and summer. And Dead Duck Chuck's stamp cracks me <br/>
up every time I run across it.  :-)<br/>
