This may not be everyone's cup of tea: but I am making a letterbox <br/>
available during a special event being held during Holy Week only. <br/>
This is a non-denominational Christian labyrinth experience. This <br/>
contemplative multimedia walk takes about one hour - you can read <br/>
more details below. I have led this project with a small group at <br/>
our church for the past 5 years. It is a wonderful experience. To <br/>
combine my love of this labyrinth and my love of letterboxing, I <br/>
decided to offer a special limited edition letterbox for <br/>
letterboxing visitors. Everyone is welcome to walk the labyrinth! <br/>
Details about the labyrinth follow. Letterboxers who choose to walk <br/>
the path may ask any Labyrinth worker for "Station 13" when they <br/>
have completed their walk. The Labyrinth Letterbox will only be <br/>
available during Labyrinth hours (see below). I plan to be there as <br/>
often as I can, so if you visit, do ask for Monica. If I am there, I <br/>
would love to exchange with you! If you can answer this question, I <br/>
will also share my personal traveler with you: What does the <br/>
word "ouroboros" mean? <br/>
<br/>
The details about the event follow:<br/>

Participants can come at any time during labyrinth hours. The CD-<br/>
guided walk takes about one hour. Meditations, background music and <br/>
instructions are on a CD, which you listen to on headphones while <br/>
carrying a personal CD player provided by the Labyrinth Team.  <br/>
<br/>
Call Monica at 856-429-5122 for more information. You may call to <br/>
reserve a time for your walk, but reservations are not required. If <br/>
you would like to bring a group (youth group, prayer group, etc.), <br/>
please call and we will set up a time to accommodate your <br/>
group.Invite your friends and family! There is no cost.<br/>
<br/>
Questions and Answers about the Labyrinth experience.<br/>
<br/>
What kind of activities are along the path? Will I feel <br/>
uncomfortable?<br/>
<br/>
The activities are as simple as watching a video, planting a seed or <br/>
leaving your footprints in the sand. Of course, if you feel <br/>
uncomfortable with any activity you can feel free to skip it. Your <br/>
participation level is at your own discretion. No one will be <br/>
watching to see what you do. There is no right or wrong way to walk <br/>
the labyrinth.<br/>
<br/>
I'm afraid I'll feel self-conscious, thinking other people are <br/>
watching me. Will I have to interact with others? <br/>
<br/>
No. You travel through the canvas labyrinth design wearing a walkman-<br/>
style CD player and going at your own pace. Others going through the <br/>
labyrinth will be occupied with their own journey. If you like, at <br/>
the end of your journey you may stay to chat with others about your <br/>
experience or you may want to leave and continue your thoughts in <br/>
private. It's up to you.<br/>
<br/>
Do I need to prepare in any way before coming? Should I bring <br/>
anything?<br/>
<br/>
No advance preparation is needed. Just set aside one hour for <br/>
yourself. You will probably want to wear comfortable clothes, and <br/>
you will be invited to remove your shoes (if you like.) You may also <br/>
bring your own walkman-style CD player if you like. We will have <br/>
players available here for your use.<br/>
<br/>
What will I get out of this labyrinth experience?<br/>
<br/>
It really depends on what you want to get out of it. If you are <br/>
tired and stressed with the distractions of life, you might enjoy a <br/>
gentle hour of relaxation and reflection. If you are yearning for a <br/>
closer relationship with God, an hour of focus and contemplation may <br/>
help to bring the closeness you desire. If you are struggling with <br/>
emotional hurt and pain in your life, this hour can be a healing <br/>
experience, helping you to let go of pain and anger. If you're not <br/>
sure of what you're looking for, an open mind during your walk could <br/>
light a pathway to your soul!</div>
