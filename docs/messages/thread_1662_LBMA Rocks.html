Thank you for saying what most people propbably feel, as we truly <br/>
appreciate somebody who actually keeps it real without pretention.  <br/>
You hit it right on the head about the true founders.  One wonders <br/>
why they left, perhaps not.<br/>
<br/>
It is not an old vs new or established vs neophyte thing.  It is an <br/>
arrogance vs anything thing.<br/>

<br/>
   I just wanted to say that i totally understand where you are <br/>
coming from-- I've had a few run in's 'with those who shall not be <br/>
named' over some fellow LBMA'ers-- it's just so sad when a 'self <br/>
appointed few' dictate how the game should be played.  I try not to <br/>
get caught up in the mess!  I have withdrawn, and decided to play <br/>
the game how I want to play, making my own 'rules' as I go- enjoying <br/>
myself, rather than worrying about the consequences.  I stay off the <br/>
main list, but I read the LBMA group everyday, it makes my <br/>
letterboxing heart happy!! Just to know that we respect eachother's <br/>
opinions and leave it that is enough for me- I am glad you are not <br/>
throwing in the towel, Irene, that would be a horrible loss for <br/>
letterboxing, you are a true delight and a blessing to our <br/>
letterboxing community!! And as my dad, leafcutters, would say- <br/>
about the LB elite- F*@% 'em, if they want to be snobs, they deserve <br/>
what they get! Lots of love and hugs-- Lotus<br/>

<div>Gosh, what would I do without you to pick me up at the train station? &lt;s&gt; {{{{{{{{{{{{{{H&amp;H}}}}}}}}}}}}}}} I'm sure glad I wasn't involved in whatever straw broke the camel's back. I totally agree with you on all counts. There is no shortage of #&amp;%holes and snobs anywhere on the planet. No reason why letterboxing should be a different. I think I have mentioned before that I decided I have to stay away from the big list for my own mental health. It's not just the LBE (Letterboxing Elite) that are to blame, the big list is just too big. I think it's too big to have any feeling of community. It's just too easy for people to sit there and flame and rave and rant at peole they don't know and will never meet. </div>

<div>&lt;s&gt; And yes I dooooooooo believe she did call someone a crummy carver. She must be killed, or at the very least pinched. &lt;s&gt; </div>

<div>Just wanted to drop you all a note to say thanks. Thanks for being exactly who you are.

movie on Mark Pepe's web site, NONE OF THOSE PEOPLE ARE THERE! The <br/>
self-appointed Letterboxing Police are Johnny-come-lately's, just <br/>
like the rest of us, they just came along a few years earlier. And <br/>
yes, they have all worked very hard to grow this hobby and make it <br/>
great, but damn it, so have we!!. The folks who were at that very <br/>
first gathering, the real founders, never post nasty posts slamming <br/>
anyone on any subject they want, nor do they email all of<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;  their friends off list and tell them to start mob-emailing <br/>
</span></blockquote>someone they don't agree with. Nor do they contact the webmasters <br/>
and try and get them involved in their little power plays and high <br/>
school mentality politics. It just makes me sick. Over the last <br/>
couple of years I have read post after post of people giving up on <br/>
the big list because of all of this and leaving the hobby and <br/>
thought "Man, they must have a pretty thin skin". Well, now I know <br/>
how they feel! It's always the same folks, jumping on the dog pile, <br/>
circling the wagons and using the excuse of trying to keep the hobby <br/>
pure to explain themselves. <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;    <br/>
&gt;   Except here, on this list. I love this list because I don't <br/>

anyone else. And you know what, they're not!!! Each of us is equal <br/>
to the other, regardless of how many years, or plants or finds you <br/>
have. Whether you are the crappiest carver on the planet or the <br/>
reincarnation of Michelangelo himself, no one on this list, or on <br/>
any list in my opinion, is more valuable, more important than anyone <br/>
else. But at least here we know that. I think we all respect each <br/>
other, even when we disagree, and we realize that each and every one <br/>
of us adds value to this hobby. And that's the whole thing in a <br/>
