<br/>
1) Do any of the 'old time' letterboxers remember a clue to a box <br/>
located on top of Haycock Mountain in Bucks County, PA that involved <br/>
finding a red-flame?  My dad seems to remember such a clue, but we <br/>
can't find it in our notebook, and I tried to find it online with no <br/>
luck- if anyone could help, I would really appreciate it- dad's <br/>
driving me crazy with this clue! <br/>
<br/>
2) I recently met up with Crayola Posse, and they had a very nice LB <br/>
sticker on the back of their car- i don't know if it was custom made, <br/>
or if they are available for purchase.  I know silent doug offers <br/>
one, but I dont want one that has LB (with letterboxing.info) <br/>
underneath. <br/>
<br/>
3) How is anyone supposed to figure out the Zeno's Paradox <br/>
letterboxes-- I have been racking my brain for weeks!  (that one is <br/>
not a question- just a statement- lol!)<br/>
<br/>
4) Have any LBMA'ers been to CT to letterbox?  We are going in May, <br/>
looking for a few pointers- recommended boxes?<br/>

<br/>
I don't think we've posted here yet, but we've been reading along <br/>
for a week or so...<br/>
<br/>
My name is Sara and my boyfriend is Dave and we are team <br/>
*HappilyEverAfter* .. I am from South Jersey (right outside Philly) <br/>
and the boyfriend is from Long Island. Right now we are finishing up <br/>
our fourth and final year at University of New Haven in CT. <br/>
<br/>
So.. in a few months we hope to be boxing with the lot of you! :) <br/>
<br/>
But for now.. we are spending all our free time boxing in CT. <br/>
<br/>
So... if anyone wants to box in CT we know where a lot of boxes are <br/>
and of some great parks that are loaded. Do you know where in CT you <br/>
will be traveling? NE? NW? South? or just in general? The state is <br/>
bigger than it looks on paper! :) and there are probably more boxes <br/>
per square inch in CT than anywhere else! <br/>
<br/>
Feel free to ask us anything about boxing CT.. we'd love to share <br/>
our favorites. 3 places worth checking out off the top of my head..<br/>
<br/>
Barkhamsted, CT (two state parks and over 15 boxes)<br/>
Hamden, CT (Sleeping Giant Park is lovely! and over 8 boxes there)<br/>
Mattatuck State Park (Home of the leathermans cave &amp; a couple boxes)<br/>
<br/>
FYI - if you go to <br/>
<a href="http://dep.state.ct.us/burnatr/forestry/centen/letterbox.htm" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://dep.state.ct.us/burnatr/forestry/centen/letterbox.htm</a><br/>
<br/>
CT State actually will send u a patch if you collect 5 of their 30 <br/>
boxes (each in a different state park) TeamHappilyEverAfter is <br/>
shooting for all 30... then we get a walking stick compliments of <br/>
the state!<br/>
<br/>
Hope that helps.. don't be afraid to ask for more info, I could talk <br/>
about boxin' for hours :) <br/>
<br/>

We stopped at Mt. Tom and looked for Bray Loop<br/>
Metamorphasis - found the notebook but the stamp was<br/>
gone and things were scattered.  Hopefully the owners<br/>
have replaced it.<br/>
<br/>
We also found the LB on the Beau Bridges Trail.<br/>
<br/>
Other than that we ended up in Vermont (Quechee Gorge)<br/>
and then stopped at Chicopee SP in Massachusetts on<br/>
the way home.<br/>
<br/>
All 3 were good leg stretchers after several hours on<br/>
the road.<br/>

The town is fabulous- lots of parks all close to each other, nice old <br/>
cemetarys, 3 popular old-time general stores (right out of the <br/>
movies).  And lots and lots of boxes!  You will love it! The stamps <br/>
are really wonderful-each one better than the next.  The next town <br/>
over even has a drive-in moveie theatre with 3 screens. We picked up a <br/>
town map with all the streets on it and mapped out a great route.<br/>

&gt; Hello, <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I don't think we've posted here yet, but we've been reading along <br/>
&gt; for a week or so...<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; My name is Sara and my boyfriend is Dave and we are team <br/>
&gt; *HappilyEverAfter* .. I am from South Jersey (right outside <br/>
Philly) <br/>
&gt; and the boyfriend is from Long Island. Right now we are finishing <br/>
up <br/>
&gt; our fourth and final year at University of New Haven in CT. <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; So.. in a few months we hope to be boxing with the lot of you! :) <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; But for now.. we are spending all our free time boxing in CT. <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; So... if anyone wants to box in CT we know where a lot of boxes <br/>
are <br/>
&gt; and of some great parks that are loaded. Do you know where in CT <br/>
you <br/>
&gt; will be traveling? NE? NW? South? or just in general? The state is <br/>
&gt; bigger than it looks on paper! :) and there are probably more <br/>
boxes <br/>
&gt; per square inch in CT than anywhere else! <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Feel free to ask us anything about boxing CT.. we'd love to share <br/>
&gt; our favorites. 3 places worth checking out off the top of my head..<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Barkhamsted, CT (two state parks and over 15 boxes)<br/>
&gt; Hamden, CT (Sleeping Giant Park is lovely! and over 8 boxes there)<br/>
&gt; Mattatuck State Park (Home of the leathermans cave &amp; a couple <br/>
boxes)<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; FYI - if you go to <br/>
&gt; <a href="http://dep.state.ct.us/burnatr/forestry/centen/letterbox.htm" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://dep.state.ct.us/burnatr/forestry/centen/letterbox.htm</a><br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; CT State actually will send u a patch if you collect 5 of their 30 <br/>
&gt; boxes (each in a different state park) TeamHappilyEverAfter is <br/>
&gt; shooting for all 30... then we get a walking stick compliments of <br/>
&gt; the state!<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Hope that helps.. don't be afraid to ask for more info, I could <br/>
talk <br/>
&gt; about boxin' for hours :) <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Sara of *HappilyEverAfter*<br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; 4) Have any LBMA'ers been to CT to letterbox?  We are going in <br/>
&gt; May, <br/>
&gt; &gt; looking for a few pointers- recommended boxes?<br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; Okay-- i guess that's it, <br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; thanks, <br/>
&gt; &gt; Lotus<br/>
