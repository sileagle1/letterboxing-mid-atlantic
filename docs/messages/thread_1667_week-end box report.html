was a cache close by. Employing ELP (extraletterboxperception) I found it. This cache is a <br/>
good distance from my box and the cache has specific clues so no chanche of mix up. It's <br/>
quite a busy little cache! The log was full and enjoyed reading the entries. My poor little LB <br/>
hadn't been visited since Nov., by Sheba and at that time she left a HH which I have moved <br/>
on.</div>
