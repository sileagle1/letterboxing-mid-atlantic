<br/>
Secondly - here is a list of my attempts and finds so far this <br/>
weekend.  We went to MD for Moni and Aussifire's daughter (Princess <br/>
Nicole) baptism.  Of course since we were out of our well boxed <br/>
area, we set out to do some Urban boxing in Baltimore.  I did live <br/>
here for 4 years and always enjoy returning for a trip!!<br/>
<br/>
Urban boxing is a creature on to itself as many of you know!!  We <br/>
tried three boxes at Patterson Park to include Patterson Park <br/>
Pagoda, Patterson Park Boat Lake and Babe Ruth.  We did find gifts <br/>
at each (needles, syringes, feces and toilet paper) but no boxes.  <br/>
We knew some of them may be missing, but now we KNOW that they <br/>
are!!  <br/>
<br/>
So anyway - here was our list of finds and attempts:<br/>
4/15/06<br/>
+ honeygo - first finders<br/>
+ Sea between the Land - found - I use to spend a lot of time across <br/>
the street at one of the bars..... :)<br/>
+ Hairspray - found<br/>
+ Stoney Run at Wyman Park - found<br/>
+ Babe Ruth - attmepted - missing<br/>
+ Texas Tourist - attmepted - missing<br/>
+ Patterson Park Pagoda - attempted - missing<br/>
+ Patterson Park Boat Lake - attempted - not willing to dig that far<br/>
+ To 1 in Baltimore - attempted - we missed something - will be back <br/>
again!!<br/>
<br/>
4/16/06 - much better results<br/>
+ Herring Run - found<br/>
+ Marshy Point Nature Center<br/>
<br/>
Thank you to everyone for their plants to allow usd to have a great <br/>
weekend letterboxing!!  We are hoping we will get more tomorrow!!<br/>
