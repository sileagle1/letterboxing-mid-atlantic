<br/>
I took my parents and brother and their first letterbox outing.. and <br/>
unfortunatly.. the first three boxes we sought were naught to be <br/>
found. (They began to think I was crazy "Yea Sara.. sure they hide <br/>
tupperware in the woods..") Luckily I had several clue sheets for <br/>
boxes within Pennypack Park. We went on later to find the Mint Box, <br/>
Playmaker's Pennypack Park Box, and the Birdhouse box. <br/>
<br/>
Has anyone had any luck finding the Pennypack Park Series by Joesph? I <br/>
could have swore I was in the right spot each time.. just no box.. <br/>
Anyone know if they have been retired? I also had no luck finding the <br/>
Ben Franklin - Scientist box.. any one tried that one lately?<br/>
<br/>
Our Welsh Terrier, Fifer, had the best time.. hes now letterboxing <br/>
hooked.. although when he was digging next to me while I was moving <br/>
leaves around.. I'm not sure he understood what we were after.  <br/>

Joseph's Pennypack Park boxes 7/6/05.  The clues were fairly <br/>
straightforward but these were some of our first boxes and I remember <br/>
we had trouble with a couple of them -- our fault, not the clues.  We <br/>
spent the longest time looking for the Birdhouse Box that day, again <br/>
attributable to beginner's skills....<br/>
