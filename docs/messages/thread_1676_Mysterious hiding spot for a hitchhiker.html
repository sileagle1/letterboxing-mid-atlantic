<div><font face="Arial" size="2">So all you people who thought you knew where Dave 
and I hid that HH...</font></div>
<div><font face="Arial" size="2">I guess you had a busy spring, because Dave just 
went back to NJ from RI and when he stopped at a particular mystery box to drop 
off a brandy-new HH, he found the one we had left there all those months ago. 
</font></div>
<div><font face="Arial" size="2">Now, I don't want to hear anymore complaining about 
lack of HH's in NJ. Dave has started carving HH's and will be putting them out 
and about as he has time. So get out there and look.</font></div>
