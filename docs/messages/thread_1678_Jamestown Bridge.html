<div><font face="Arial" size="2">Well, looks like tomorrow is the day that the old 
Jamestown Bridge comes down. I'm hoping to see it happen with my Mom from 
somewhere in Jamestown. Her father and bBrother helped to build the bridge. My 
Father-in-law also worked on the bridge and will be able to view it's 
demolition from the Saunderstown side (on his 89th birthday). I found a few 
websites that have great pictures of the old bridge. Maybe even of the old 
resting place of the Drew Clan Letterbox. Too bad that one went missing before 
Dave and I started 'boxing 3 years ago. Dave and I planted a new series down in 
NJ in the Pine Barrens to commemorate different types of Bridges. Unless we find 
a local to adopt it, we will probably pull the series when Dave's active duty is 
done. But for now the "Bridges of Burlington County" does homage to the 
Jamestown Bridge (a combination truss and cantilever bridge) and 4 other types 
of Bridges.</font></div>

David &amp; I are moving back to Gloucester County, NJ in the beggining of <br/>
June. We would be happy to adopt your boxes for you when the time <br/>
comes. We haven't found them yet, but the next time we are in Jersey, <br/>
I think Dave just moved them to the top of our list. (We love to stop <br/>
at bridges)<br/>
