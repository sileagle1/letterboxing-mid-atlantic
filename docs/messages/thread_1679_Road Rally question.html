is right up the street from a small town park.  Last year's setting was perfect, but there is a <br/>
bike ride in town I am desperately trying to avoid.<br/>
<br/>
The rally consists of a meticulously described route to 5 - 12 locations throughout <br/>
Montgomery, Berks, &amp; Lehigh counties.  The route includes clues to boxes planted at those <br/>
locations a short distance from the parking area.  The circuit takes between 2-3 hours to <br/>
complete.  The objective is to complete the circuit as accurately as possible.  The judges <br/>
have established a "perfect" run time, following all traffic rules, speeds, etc.  You must <br/>
attempt to match the run time as close as possible without going under.  Faster <br/>
contestants are disqualified.  In addition there may be unannounced boxes along the route <br/>
that contestants can find for bonuses and prizes.  I say "may be" because there were not <br/>
last year.  I won't know if there will be this year either, but I like to keep my options open.<br/>
There may be additional bedevilment provided by other competitors that is not officially <br/>
sanctioned by the rally, but is fun nonetheless.<br/>
After your circuit, most people hang out and enjoy each other's company until the final run <br/>
has returned and the winners are announced.<br/>
<br/>
So you tell me.  Will your teenagers like it? <br/>
