<br/>
So, where is everybody boxing this weekend?<br/>
<br/>
I may have to live vicarioulsy, as "She who must be obeyed" has <br/>
mandated a yard cleanup!  (the lawn is ok,but we have some overgrown <br/>
weeds and shrubber!).<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, If anybody can justtify coming to the Allentown/ Bethlehem/ <br/>
Easton area to find some boxes that are along bike paths (i.e., Space <br/>
Traveler Series along the Lehigh Canal Towpath or the Shad Ladder in <br/>
Easton or the Couple in the Raubsville/ Riegelsville/ Durham along <br/>
the Delaware, the Northampton Bath Bike Trail near Bath - a geo/lb <br/>
hybrid), I can be of assistance as I know these Bike Routes Pretty <br/>
Well.<br/>
<br/>
I think that such an offer may set me free for a day from yard work, <br/>
if I promise to be Yard Minion the rest of the holiday weekend).<br/>
<br/>
Fleur - I know you like to bike - Hound the fiance, come to the <br/>
scenic Lehigh Valley.  Find a Volleyball or a Rose!<br/>
<br/>
Happy Trails (Bike?),<br/>

                    <div id="ygrps-yiv-23620157"><div>Well, Dude and I are heading to Washington Crossing to plant two boxes for next weekends gathering. The 2 box series is called "Big Green Monster" and it is named after an insect that you find along the East Coast. It's in two boxes because...well you'll find out next weekend! I found a dead one out hiking and thought it was pretty cool. Monday, my husband Harris will again be letterboxing with us ('ray!) and we will be hunting the Bowman's Wildflower Preserve box. This box is tough for some folks because the clues are plants and trees. Harris is a PhD botanist, so it should be a cake walk (we hope). This will be his third time letterboxing with me since January, so I guess he needs a stamp. He hiked Silent Doug's "Alder Leaf" with me and we just camped in MD and did some of the Patapsco boxes together. It's a real treat when he can come along because his weekends are all tied up with politics (he's our local Democratic chairman) but holiday weekends are usually time
 off from door knocking and voter registration drives so we get to hang out together like (semi) normal people. Have fun everyone and I hope to see many of you next weekend!</div>

Saturday, and the Pat Benetar concert in South Jersey<br/>
on Sunday.  Plus I'll have relatives visiting for the<br/>
holidays.  I already accomplished some letterboxing<br/>
this week, though.  I planted my first box, Buttercup,<br/>
in Haddon Heights.  <br/>

Have a great 4th!<br/>

about?)<br/>
We're heading for a friend's mother's beach house later today for a <br/>
party tomorrow for my daughter's turning-8-year-old buddy. I want to <br/>
take advantage of being in the area to run down and check on my <br/>
Mosquito Madness box, if we can justify spending the park entrance <br/>
fee on a holiday weekend just for that! (note to self - bring bug <br/>
repellant, bring bug repellant...)<br/>
Sunday church commitments keep us close to home.<br/>
Monday another birthday party, this time for 19 and 21 year old sons <br/>
of friends, brings us to the Vineland area. If we leave early we <br/>
might be able to snag a box on the way down.<br/>
(Memories of getting soaked and muddy by the Devil's Bathtub after a <br/>
rainy period and then showing up for a holiday dinner. "You were <br/>
doing WHAT?")<br/>
