                    <div id="ygrps-yiv-1857297625">Peters Valley is part of the Delaware Water Gap National Recreation <br/>
Area, on the Sussex County side.  There are very few boxes in Sussex.  <br/>
Not sure if the lack of boxes is due to lack of boxers in that <br/>
relatively sparsely populated part of the state, or because of the <br/>
federal parkland.<br/>
<br/>
Either way, Peters Valley is worth a visit.  Their fall fair used to <br/>
be at the valley -- looking at the website now, I see that it has been <br/>
moved to the Sussex Co fairgrounds.  If you go, there is (or at least <br/>
used to be) a drive-in restaurant at the corner of Rts 15 and 206, <br/>
with decent hotdogs served by carhops on rollerskates.<br/>

</span></blockquote> I think the boxes that ARE in that area are all older boxes, from <br/>
back when LBing was an add-on activity for some very serious hikers. <br/>
Thus they are all on the very tippy-top of the Kittatinny Ridge. If <br/>
I ever build up the stamina to get up a hill without huffing and <br/>
puffing, I'm going after them...<br/>
<br/>
There's a bunch of over-lapping/abutting parks out there. (DGNWA, <br/>
Worthington, Stokes) I think the best way to get a good idea of the <br/>
trails would be through the nynjtc maps of the area (#s 15-18)<br/>
