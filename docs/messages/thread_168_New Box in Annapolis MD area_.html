We live in a public space and have a wonderful public garden so our<br/>
1st box is and easy placement but I know that other boxers in our<br/>
area will enjoy the setting. The clue is as follows:<br/>
<br/>
The Green Rose Labyrinth Letterbox<br/>
Difficulting rating of 1/Terrain rating of 2.25<br/>
Heading north, away from Annapolis, on 178/Generals Hwy, just passed<br/>
the intersection of Crownsville Rd and Generals Hwy, take your 1st<br/>
right into the parking lot and ......<br/>
There lies a land of swirling flowers and orbiting<br/>
satellites. So come "Fellow Travelers" and leave your vehicle behind,<br/>
perhaps you'll sup and dine. And then pass beneath the wicker arch<br/>
into the Garden of verdant twisting delights. There you will find<br/>
peace of mind and the first turning path. Take moment, learn to feel,<br/>
stretch your legs on the Baltic Wheel.<br/>
Now again beneath a second arch, meander along, a stroll not<br/>
a march. At the entrance pause and still your thoughts, read some<br/>
history of the paths, yes, there's lots. And then with a ring of the<br/>
bell, set off down the turning trail. Take not the shortcut to the<br/>
central fire, rather the long and winding way shall lead you to<br/>
your desires. Enjoy the walk, to pass an hour, and if they are<br/>
blooming, take time to smell the flowers. Have faith and indeed<br/>
continue on, pass either side of the "Hugging Tree" and then beyond.<br/>
Be not dismayed by the image of your own demise, "reflect" for a<br/>
moment on how time flies. Now just along and around the bend, over<br/>
the bridge and there my friend, you will find beneath the canopy of<br/>
emerald roses, and contain in a place of easy supposes, the object of<br/>
your quest. Sit for a while and read, stamp away and then proceed<br/>
along the unicursal path, filled with the all encompassing sacred<br/>
math. Turn some more, and then you shall come, to the heart, the<br/>
hearth, and the sum. Stay here for a spell, reflect and breath and<br/>
make yourself well. So to please, leave your worries to fly in the<br/>
breeze. And then if you find that time will allow, retrace your steps<br/>
and focus on the now.<br/>
Thank you for your time my friend, and perhaps one day you shall come<br/>
and circle round again.<br/>
Much Peace,<br/>
"The Road goes ever on...'<br/>
