He can also let us know when they will be heading down so we can get together with them for greetings and exchanges.

Bull's Island is just north of Lambertville. It's not far from<br/>
Washington Crossing, Tyler or you. Checking the map I notice that<br/>
Nockamixon/Haycock aren't too far away either.<br/>
