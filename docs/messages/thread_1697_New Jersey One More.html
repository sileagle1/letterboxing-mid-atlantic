<br/>
I just added what I think may be a difficult mystery box to <br/>
letterboxing.org, Unfathomable New Jersey.  I didn't get a chance to <br/>
finish the clues yesterday.  If you find it, email me &amp; I'll ask a <br/>
simple question to verify, if you get it right you'll get a clue to <br/>
an unplublished mystery box and as of yet unplanted mystery box.<br/>
<br/>
Yes Aud, this is the same Wingfoot.  I've been a little hesitant to <br/>
plant too many drive bys as I don't like to lose boxes.  So we'll <br/>
see how my new drive bys go. <br/>
<br/>
By the way, all my new releases this weekend are hand carved.  <br/>
Poorly at that, but hand carved nonetheless.  As usual, with any new <br/>
boxes some of the clues may have to be tweaked, so if there are any <br/>
problems with them, let me know.  I should have another release of <br/>
boxes sometime in the future.<br/>
