recently posted 2 letterboxes at the center. I completed one box which <br/>
was a fun find. This box is a small store bought stamp. The other box <br/>
is in a different section of the center which is not for kids under 10 <br/>
years old. I contacted the placer who works there and is also in charge <br/>
of books at the Museum of Natural History in DC. She told me the store <br/>
bought stamp was a last minute idea, and I recommended a hand <br/>
carved stamp be done to replace the store-bought stamp. She has asked <br/>
me to carve one for her. Woohoo! carving for Smithonian! The other box <br/>
apparently is hand carved. <br/>
   I had been to the center before with my kids, and it is a wonderful, <br/>
hands-on, place for kids to see and learn. Ther are wonderful things to <br/>
do there and a great way to keep young minds occupied. Last visit, my 3 <br/>
and 5 year olds put together a human skeleton. There is also a deer <br/>
skeleton that can be put together. New twist on puzzles!<br/>
  The back room for kids 10 and up is full of skeletons and science <br/>
tables. Kids are able to use microscopes and do experiments.<br/>
 I highly recommend these boxes if you have younger letterboxers in <br/>
your group ( or even if you don't). Oh...It's FREE! <br/>
