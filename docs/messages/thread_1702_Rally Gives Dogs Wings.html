                    <div id="ygrps-yiv-895480850">I just wanted to post an update on the Rally Gives Dogs Wings drive. <br/>
Today in the mail I received checks which took us to my half way goal<br/>
of $500.  This has been such an inspiring experience for me, proving<br/>
that our letterboxing family is more caring and compassionate than I<br/>
had ever hoped.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks to all who contribute,<br/>
