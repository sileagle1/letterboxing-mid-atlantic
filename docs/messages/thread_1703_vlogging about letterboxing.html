<div>That sounds like it would get pretty complicated. You would send the video to each person who wants to look for the box? They would send it back? hummmm...I dunno. From what I've heard from different people, it can be hard enough to get some people to send a PLB on, much less a tape back to someone. </div>

<div>Hi,</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Welcome to our unique hobby. I hope you have fun. Here's the but...........no, you don't film the way to the hiding place of someone else's box. This is pretty basic stuff. If you have their permission, it's a free country and you can do what you want I guess,  but I can't imagine anyone letting you show the way to one of their boxes, (or their stamp) especially if it's a video blog that will be online for anyone to see. That pretty much destroys the whole point of the hobby. </div>
<div> </div>
<div>If it could be done as a mystery sort of, with fade-outs, having landmarks camoflauged, maybe. But you still must get the permission of the box's owner. On the whole, it's an idea I am against. I **do** appreciate you asking about it and not just going ahead and doing it like some might have. </div>

<div>Yes, I said that to the person who wanted to put it on the blog. I guess I assumed the person using the video as a clue wouldn't want it online. It would have to be a password protected site to keep anyone who happened to find it from looking. </div>
