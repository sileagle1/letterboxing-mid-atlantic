go on a few long hikes today, loggin in about 9 miles between <br/>
sat/sun.  Good news is that I found a certain WOM in Maryland alive <br/>
and well, checked on one of my long hike boxes, and planted another in <br/>
a different area in Virginia in the "martial arts" series...I hope to <br/>
get clues up soon.  Along the way, I thought of a new idea for a box <br/>
that I dont think has been done before, and am pretty siked to get <br/>
going on it.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks to the planters of boxes I found this weekend...always a <br/>
pleasure.<br/>
<br/>
Peace.</div>
