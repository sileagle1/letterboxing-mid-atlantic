rally. Everything went great until we got to Box #4 - that was when we<br/>
first got accosted by mean Mr. Property Owner and then ended up in the<br/>
woods with Warcat!! Doesn't matter, Midnight Boxer and I really<br/>
enjoyed ourselves anyway and it was nice to see 'the gang' again. <br/>
<br/>
The Eevil doers of the group did not disappoint us either. That was<br/>
especially nice of Lightnin' But who was "just checking to make sure<br/>
we found  box #8 ok." Little did we know, an apparently Team Eevil<br/>
Dawg too, that there was a NUMBER on the inside of the birdhouse??<br/>
Details!  <br/>
<br/>
Again, thank you to Nat for all his hard work - you have our vote any<br/>
day! :)  <br/>
