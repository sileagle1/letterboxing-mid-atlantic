again.  We appreciate all the hard work that went into the planning.  <br/>
Couldn't believe we were the only ones to check out those signs and <br/>
score the bonuses.  And such shock when we finished 3rd this year!  We <br/>
never expected that (we were just hoping not to be last).<br/>
The gathering itself was wonderful- what a fabulous group of boxers who <br/>
are really becoming such good friends.<br/>
The weather was spectacular- we couldn't have asked for a better day.<br/>
Thanks again!<br/>
