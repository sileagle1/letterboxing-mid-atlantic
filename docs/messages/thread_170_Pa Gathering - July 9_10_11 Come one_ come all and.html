<div>Hey there fellow boxers,</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Sorry again for the multiple posts. Just a friendly reminder about the gathering next weekend in beautiful Bucks County, PA. There is a weekend camp out at Colonial Woods Campground in Upper Black Eddy, PA <a href="http://www.colonialwoods.com/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">www.colonialwoods.com</a> but I don't know if there are any tent sites left. Also there will be a day gathering on Saturday the 10th from 9:00 AM to 3:00 PM (approximate) at the Sullivan Pavilion, which is behind the Thompson Neely House in Washington Crossing, Pa. just across the road from Bowman's Hill Wildflower Preserve. There are lot's of great boxes within a few feet to an hours drive so it will be a great opportunity to hunt boxes, meet fellow boxers, share trail stories and do image exchanges. </div>
<div> </div>
<div><u><strong>I need some help with the food.</strong></u> Please see below:</div>
<div> </div>
<div><u><strong>Saturday Gatherers</strong></u> - I need volunteers to bring soda, water, lunch type stuff (cut up hoagies?). I will be at the pavilion all day and am willing to man a grill if someone wants to donate dogs and burgers or something. Just an idea. Please email me OFF LIST if you can contribute. </div>
<div> </div>
<div><u><strong>Campers</strong></u> - There is a group dinner Saturday night and a breakfast on Sunday morning. Please email Judy B. at <a href="mailto:sowbiz@..." rel="nofollow" target="_blank">sowbiz@...</a> if you can contribute to either meal. </div>
<div> </div>
<div>This should be a great time for all and thank you in advance for your help! See you next weekend.</div>
