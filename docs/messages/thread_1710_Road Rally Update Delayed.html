                    <div id="ygrps-yiv-239557107">I apologize for not having the Road Rally Review Ready.  I have been at the police station In <br/>
Salford filling out reports and answering questions about today's shooting.<br/>
<br/>
You see, I went back to Box #4 to pick it up and apologize to the property owner who was <br/>
upset by our activities.  He was none-too-pleased when I approached his house this <br/>
morning.  In fact, you can see his response in a picture I took from my cell phone as I ran <br/>
back towards my car.  It's in the Photos section.<br/>
<br/>
More later after the bail hearing. <br/>

<br/>
I will miss you all.<br/>
