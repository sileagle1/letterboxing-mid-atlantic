Amy, Thomas and I are going to be visiting family in Philly at the end <br/>

any good boxes in the area to take a two year old on?  And are there <br/>

are you going to be in town?<br/>
<br/>
There are a few boxes in the city, but tons outside the city in Bucks <br/>
and Montgomery County.  In Bucks County, Hikers and Hounds' series The <br/>
Brave Little Caterpiller <br/>

The Boxes in Pennypack Park in Philadelphia would be fine for your kid <br/>
as well.  The Pennypack Park Series <br/>
