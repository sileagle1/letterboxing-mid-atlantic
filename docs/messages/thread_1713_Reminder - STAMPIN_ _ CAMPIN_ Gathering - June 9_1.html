Little Bennett is within an hours or less drive of hundreds of boxes in MD, DC, VA and WV. So pick the boxes you wish to hunt during the day and then hang out for a group dinner Saturday night and breakfast Sunday morning. Anyone who arrives Friday night will be fed Saturday AM as well.<br/><br/>I have reserved site 43 for 6 people and we are now full. My chief cooks and bottle washers, Sowsewbizzy and Miz Scarlet, will be camping with me, along with a couple of
 other folks. Sites 44, 45, 46, and 47 are close to us us but will be rented first come, first serve. Each site can hold up to 6 people, no restriction on the number of tents. Rates vary on the number of nights/people you will need. The sites are in the back of loop C, remote but within walking distance of the bathhouse.<br/><br/>Dude and I will bring all of the cooking gear. Anyone who wants to donate food for either Saturday dinner or Sunday breakfast can email us at hikers_n_hounds@... <br/>We also have an extra tent if anyone would like to come but doesnt have one.<br/><br/>So sign up on Atlas Quest and come down to MD, bring your own clues. Well have good food, a roaring fire and lots of trails stories to share. Dude promises not to snore too loudly. I cant say the same for me!</div> <div> </div><p>
