I discovered a strange phenomenon which may shorten if not end my quest for Letterboxing <br/>

by 20-30 degrees.  The effect is most pronounced when I am facing south, but I can see the <br/>
effect to a lesser degree when facing west or easterly.<br/>

Before you ask, yes, I removed my cell phone, watch, keys and all metal except my zipper.  I <br/>
also duplicated the effects (to varying degrees) with both my lensatic and baseplate compass.<br/>

&gt;  We're having a great time!  Think that we're up to<br/>
&gt; F40 but yeah, the <br/>
&gt; drives are getting longer  :)<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; We have ideas for two boxes to place but we're<br/>
&gt; having a hard time <br/>
&gt; finding a Speedball kit and stamp medium.  Anyone<br/>
&gt; know of a good <br/>
&gt; source in the Media or Wilmington vicinity?<br/>
