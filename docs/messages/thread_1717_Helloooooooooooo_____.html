me?!??! ;)  LOL!<br/>
<br/>
After two months of illness, I finally went boxing yesterday for the <br/>
first time since February 20th.  (But who's counting, right?)<br/>
<br/>
I planted a box in Abington Township... clues aren't up yet, but they <br/>
should be posted today sometime.<br/>
<br/>
Celtic Cat and Wednesday Bowler, look for an update in your e-mail from <br/>
LBNA about your "Who Is the Author?" series.<br/>
<br/>
Also, several of you have asked about my "Boxers and Briefs" box.  I <br/>
was at the location yesterday, and I'm happy to report that the box is <br/>
still there, alive and well... :)<br/>
<br/>
If I owe any of you an e-mail or an answer to a question, please <br/>
consider e-mailing me directly at <a href="mailto:JSH11A@..." rel="nofollow" target="_blank">JSH11A@...</a> and using a subject <br/>
line with ALL CAPITAL LETTERS.  I'm currently catching up on two months <br/>
of my life, including approximately 1,800 - 2,000 e-mails.  And, no, <br/>
I'm not kidding.  And, yes, that's personal mail only, not work...  :P<br/>
<br/>
I hope you all had a great time at the road rally.  Please fill me in <br/>
on any other boxing news that I've missed out on while I've been out of <br/>
commission!<br/>
<br/>
Talk to y'all soon, I hope, and happy boxing!  We've had some great <br/>
days for it!<br/>
<br/>
Swallowdale :)<br/>
