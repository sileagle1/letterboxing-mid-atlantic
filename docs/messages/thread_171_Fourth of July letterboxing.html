                    <div id="ygrps-yiv-224653481">Glad you could find 'em.  The clues are now published.  They were <br/>
also within 1 mile or so of General Trexler.<br/>
<br/>
I did a brief bike ride to look for the 2 (supposedly) remaining <br/>
boxes along the Lehigh Canal (Godfrey's Box and Hole in the Wall).  <br/>
Found the spots, but disaster intervened.  Godfrey's box is best <br/>
accessed during non-poison ivy season - I'll defer till late autumn.  <br/>
I was at the Hole in the Wall and ready to dismount the MTB and I <br/>
hear "pssssshhhhh" coming from the back tire.  It was about 2.5 miles <br/>
from the trailhead, so I deferred that box until the ivy-free season <br/>
and rode my lungs out to make it back just before the tire went <br/>
totally flat.  I'm confident no rim damage occurred, but I'm glad <br/>
that I got home OK.  I'm not itching yet, but have packed the Tea <br/>
Tree Oil just in case.<br/>
<br/>
I am traveling to Western KY via Nashville on business and will be <br/>
meeting up with She Who Plants at the Nashville airport to do an <br/>
exchange.<br/>
<br/>
I'll check in again Thursday Nite!<br/>

have some updates.<br/>
<br/>
My Oak Leaf box in Canadensis is confirmed missing, and I've pulled the <br/>
clues until I have a chance to replant.<br/>
<br/>
My Pinebrook Park box near Analomink was missing, but was found by some <br/>
geocachers in a completely different location, and it has been restored to <br/>
its original location.<br/>
<br/>
Alder Leaf is still in great shape and rarely visited.<br/>

with Jennifer) on Sunday:<br/>
<br/>
In Tyler State Park, I found the remnants of the Creekside box, but the <br/>
stamp and log were missing. I left a replacement log in the box. The <br/>
landmarks here have changed due to major trail maintenance, so the clues <br/>
aren't very accurate anymore (there is no gate and we found one trail sign <br/>
that had been removed during the trail work and was sitting on the ground <br/>
out of view). Schofield Ford Covered Bridge #1 and #2, were logged, but <br/>
some of the landmarks for #1 have changed significantly (notably, there are <br/>
14 Safety Zone signs now, not 3).<br/>
<br/>
Jane Austen: Jane Austen and Jane Austen: Persuasion were both in fine <br/>
shape. Jane Austen: Mansfield Park was confirmed missing.<br/>
<br/>
In Washington's Crossing, I logged Bowman's Hill Tower and Winahawcawchunk. <br/>
We found Abstract Guitar, but not Cheshire Cat. (Irene, I don't know if the <br/>
compass reading is right, but part of the problem is knowing where to stand <br/>
"before" the fireplace -- do you mean in front of the hearth or on the <br/>
trail at the Y or next to the chimney?) (Incidentally, we tried to find <br/>
your Neshaminy boxes last week but the park gates were closed 45 minutes <br/>
before sunset! We'll try again soon.)<br/>
<br/>
I also found Victory but then was too exhausted to go on to Captain Moore's <br/>
Insignia.<br/>
<br/>
We also found the Wally Hitchhiker and the Hitchhiking Hare hitchhikers, <br/>
giving me 11 for the day.<br/>

As for me and mine, we got out here in the Annapolis MD area and went <br/>
to hit the Downs Pk boxes. Lots of rain pushed us to try out for Swan <br/>
Lake/Waterford park instead. Lovely place for a box and lots of fun <br/>
in the rain, dripping along, kids in tow, umbrella strapped to the <br/>
stroller, three boxers huddled under the umbrella, trying to stamp <br/>
while fending the baby's little grasping hands away from the <br/>
ink, "Watch her! Oh boy, shes got it on her finge...no her face..make <br/>
that her hair!",,, and of course, "Hold the umbrella still, move <br/>
over, watch the drips! There getting on the journal! Oh well, a few <br/>
runs will add to it!". Just a bit of a note to the placer, I am <br/>
already carrying a repair kit, and the box seemed abit in peril. It <br/>
is rather close to the water and the water was very high! So, we <br/>
double bagged the contents, I put some of the about letterboxing <br/>
flyers in it, and then we bagged the box itself before rehiding. The <br/>
box itself was one of the sandwich boxes, maybe not Glad, but <br/>
something like that, one of the cheaper ones that come in the multi <br/>
packs. I was looking at those myself for placing and noted that they <br/>
just don't seal well. The box was slightly open when we found it. <br/>
And, just like on our first two boxes, another boxer had been there <br/>
that day! This is driving us crazy! We sure hope we run into someone <br/>
sometime! Oh well, thats boxing!,<br/>
Much Peace &amp; happy trails,<br/>

the thunder and lightning, let me tell you! We also went after the Va Beach box,

Island Beach, since we'd already spent the gas to get 5 minutes away <br/>
for a party. Well, unfortunately, assuming we would NOT go, I had <br/>
left the clues home, and couldn't find my own box!! ("It had <br/>
something to do with those trees, there .... Behind? Between?....") <br/>
Well, we're assuming it's still there, just that I'd forgotten it <br/>
was set well into the ground (my son reminded me later), and the <br/>
reeds have added another layer of cover. The area is still full of <br/>
mosquitoes, and now green-headed flies, briars and poison ivy, too.<br/>
Monday I had my list ready as we headed to South Jersey. Six boxes <br/>
along the way. We got two, and then had to quit to make the (other) <br/>
party on time.<br/>
But, we got the "Support the Troops" HH also! We'll bring it to the <br/>
gathering on Saturday.<br/>

Aha! I knew I wasn't crazy when I hunted for #1 :) Okay..maybe I am <br/>
crazy, but I knew that 14 does not equal 3. Still didn't find it <br/>
though.<br/>

<br/>
</span></blockquote>Hi All!<br/>
<br/>
We're looking forward to seeing everyone at the Gathering on Saturday!<br/>
<br/>
We went out on Friday afternoon to kick-off our holiday weekend by <br/>
searching for Hello Kitty's brand new "Buttercup" box in Haddon <br/>
Heights. What a lovely park, and much bigger than we thought it was! <br/>
Thanks for showing us a great spot! Thanks for the HH treat, too!<br/>
<br/>
SuddenTurkey's sister came up from Dallas to spend the weekend with <br/>
us, and we got the chance to introduce her to letterboxing by <br/>
searching for letterboxingbee's "Oh, Be My Friend" box on Sunday. <br/>
That was such a neat search in an area we had never traveled before. <br/>
Now we can't wait to get to more of those Pine Barrens boxes! Erin, <br/>
who signed in as "Don't mess with Texas", is excited to try <br/>
letterboxing again when she gets back to Dallas.<br/>
<br/>
See you all on Saturday!<br/>
<br/>
