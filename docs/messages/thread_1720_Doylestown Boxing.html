                    <div id="ygrps-yiv-1832000557">Hi!  A few people at the Road Rally asked me if the "My Alma Mater-<br/>
DVC" box was still there.  Well we picked up our son today and while <br/>
we waited for him to finish an exam, we went and looked.  There was <br/>
the poor box, left out in the open- soaking wet (and we were totally <br/>
unprepared and had no supplies with us).  The log was filled and extra <br/>
sheets had been placed in. The last date we saw was Aug. 2005.  Was it <br/>
out in the open ever since? The stamp seemed OK but wet also.  So we <br/>
rehid it and notified the placer.  We did not have time to check on <br/>
our Igpay Atlinay box but last I heard it was fine.  So if anyone <br/>
wants to go to DelVal College to find 2 boxes...<br/>
