 Some of you may remember us (NatureGirl a.k.a. Tali - blue heron<br/>
stamp - and Alexander - green train stamp) from the camping trip and<br/>
Washington Crossing Gathering back in July 2004.  We've actually moved<br/>
from CT to PA now and are finally finding the time to hit the trails<br/>
and find some boxes.<br/>
<br/>
Recently we've found Trexler's Tatanka in Lehigh County.  We found two<br/>
of Stamp Collection - Northwest and Northeast (haven't looked for the<br/>
others just yet).  We found Mothra Returns! in Bernville.  At<br/>
Nescopeck Butterfly in Hazelton we picked up the Bum-Bee Hitchhiker<br/>
that had been waiting there for about a year, and we found the<br/>
Straight Arrow Hitchhiker at the Three-Eyed Fish in Wapwallopen - it<br/>
had also been waiting there for about a year!  <br/>
<br/>
As boxes aren't anywhere near as prolific as they were in CT, we're<br/>
making plans to put out a few ourselves.  We look forward to finding<br/>
more boxes here and possibly running into some of you on the trails!</div>

Nope, we PA boxers need to work hard to raise the counts.  ;-)  And <br/>
it gets sparser and sparser the further from Philly you go until you <br/>
hit State College (where the Crayola Posse prowl).  It will be so <br/>
cool to see new boxes pop up north of that box barrier known as <br/>
South Mountain/Mt. Penn in Allentown/Reading.  Good job on finding <br/>
some of the fun ones, and if you have kiddos be sure to eat your <br/>
veggies!<br/>
