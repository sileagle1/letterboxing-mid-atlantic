from a mother who read Cyclonic's Letterboxing ad in the Inquirer and was very excited to <br/>
get her daughter started letterboxing.  <br/>
Of course thje first letterbox she wanted to do was my "Harry Potter's Unicorn" in Fort <br/>
Washington. (So paying a million-five for Harry Potter licensing for that box was well worth it)  <br/>
To sweeten the pot, I carved Susannah's Magic Wand Hitchiker for her first find.<br/>
<br/>
The hitchiker is in one of those beach boxes (with the clamp latch and the rubber gasket)  I <br/>
am interested in seeing how it holds up in the field.  So if you come accross Susannah's Magic <br/>
Wand, drop me a line and let me know how the box is holding up.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks.<br/>
