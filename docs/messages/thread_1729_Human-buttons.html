Hi there,<br/>
<br/>
I am SAM, an Iraqi refugee living in Lebanon at the moment; I have spent the last 10 years of my life as a refugee registered with the UNHCR in Beirut. The last 4 years, I have spent as an activist for peace and human rights (especially refugees and asylum seekers) on the Internet; I'm also books author and ebooks publisher. I have launched many campaigns to improve our situation as refugees in Lebanon and hopefully bring more understanding to our problems worldwide. I helped make many changes and improvements at the UNHCR office in Beirut; I used the Internet as the field for my activities (you can read more about that in my free ebook 'MY CAMPAIGNS'). All my ebooks are free and could be download from my sites.<br/>
<br/>
This is my newest campaign, it's about the illegal and humiliating actions of the UNHCR, who using photos of refugees as banners and human-buttons to collect money. This is an abuse of the dignity and humanity of the refugees and must stop immediately and a clear public apology present by The United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees. My friends, I am talking about the pictures you can see here: <a href="http://news.net4free.org/unhcr4" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://news.net4free.org/unhcr4</a><br/>
<br/>
Also you can read my new campaign 'Urgent, we need smile' here: <a href="http://unwes.batcave.net/smile.html" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://unwes.batcave.net/smile.html</a><br/>
<br/>
For more info about UNHCR and life of refugees you can read my free ebooks. I invite you as fellow humans and members of the world community to support my campaign by reading my article on my site and see the human-buttons. The campaign is to support and improve the UNHCR <a href="http://www.unhcr.org" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.unhcr.org</a> especially after the last scandals in the UN and UNHCR, just for example: <a href="http://www.mizzima.com/archives/news-in-2005/news-in-april/12-April05-22.htm" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.mizzima.com/archives/news-in-2005/news-in-april/12-April05-22.htm</a><br/>
