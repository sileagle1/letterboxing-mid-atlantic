<br/>
I'm gathering up the boxes from the road rally.  I'm trying to get all the bonus boxes and <br/>
additional eeevil as well to return to the owners.<br/>
<br/>
So I park at the Salfordville Post Office - as I have many times while scouting and planting <br/>
- and head up the trail.  Now the Postmaster, who has the post office in his home, sees me <br/>
do this all the time.  He can't be happy about my parking in  his driveway and, unlike other <br/>
denizens of the Perkiomen Trail, I only ever stay for a few minutes.<br/>
<br/>
This time, he actually comes to the window and gives me a look.  Knowing I will be brief <br/>
and not return, I hustle up the trail and gather my box and two others left behind at that <br/>
location.  In the process of doing so, I get a sliver of wood in my hand.  Using my trusty <br/>
Leatherman tool I remove the sliver but manage to cut open my hand in the process.  (It's <br/>
one of those cuts on flexible skin that just bleeds and bleeds and won't close up because <br/>
the skin won't lay flat.)<br/>
On the way back to the car I notice - Wow, this is kind of different - a letterbox with a <br/>
wallet in it.  I open up the box, and sure enough, inside is a wallet with a stamp in one <br/>
section and a log where the bills usually go.  Pretty ingenious, right?<br/>
<br/>
Now picture this:  You are the Postmaster of Salfordville, PA.  Some guy - who, let's face it, <br/>
looks like a terrorist - keeps parking in your lot and sneaking off to the local hiking trail. <br/>
But he's not hiking or biking and he never stays very long.  One day, you look out your <br/>
window and here he comes - walking back to his car, rifling through somebody's wallet <br/>
with a bloody knife in his hand.  What would you do?<br/>
<br/>
Well, I didn't wait to find out.  <br/>
<br/>
I bet he's got a really great story to tell, though.</div>
