----------<br/>
I went to the Spy Museum today. It is a highly interactive museum and <br/>
there are many tasks you have to accomplish. What is funny is that I <br/>
scored majorly high on the observation stuff. It would ask questions <br/>
like "Which places would be the four most likely drop places in the <br/>
above picture" which of course in my mind translated to "Where are the <br/>
top four places in this picture that I would hide a letterbox?" Guess <br/>
what? Thinking in terms of letterboxing got me a 100%. <br/>
<br/>
Same thing with the "Name the top four suspicious people in this <br/>
picture" translates into "Which people are gonna be pitas when it <br/>
comes to rehiding a letterbox without being seen?" and again-I scored <br/>
100%. Who would have thought that letterboxing translated into Spy <br/>
training?<br/>
<br/>
Just had to share the amusement. :-)<br/>
