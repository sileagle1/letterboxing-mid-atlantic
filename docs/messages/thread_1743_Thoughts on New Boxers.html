                    <div id="ygrps-yiv-451719290">I was out with The Walker doing maintenance on a box whe I came accross some Newbies <br/>
on the trail.    They were loud and obnoxious - possibly drunk - and yelling the word <br/>
"letterbox" for all the world to hear.  I passed them and then ducked off the trail to follow <br/>
them at a discrete distance to see how they would do.<br/>
<br/>
They got lost twice and asked three people for help, telling them about the letterbox in <br/>
the process.  Eventually they found the box which they waved about and stamped-in right <br/>
on the trail with joggers and dog-walkers watching them.  They put the box back without <br/>
covering it  or sealing it and proclaimed their victory to all as they marched out.<br/>
<br/>
This provoked some thoughts I would like to share with the group in hopes of generating <br/>
some open discussion.<br/>
<br/>
One of the big fears discussed about doing publicity for letterboxing was that it might <br/>
encourage some people to look for boxes just to vandalize them.  I don't think that's <br/>
nearly as much of a problem as people looking for letterboxes who haven't been taught <br/>
the value of BEING COOL ABOUT IT.  When word of the game is passed person-to-person <br/>
one of the values communicated is often the importance of secrecy in increasing box <br/>
survival.  I don't think you get that with some kind of mass communication medium.<br/>
<br/>
I am also impressed by the number of letterboxers who play the game without <br/>
participating in the groups.  I would venture a guess that there might be more people who <br/>
box without ever setting foot here or on the big list than there are those of us who <br/>
participate in this online community.  This is significant to me because I am also <br/>
concerned about  how the values of letterboxing are transmitted via these online groups.<br/>
<br/>
So let me bring this around to a question to perhaps provoke some discussion.  Is there <br/>
something we can do to better communicate the (very few) values of letterboxing to <br/>
people?  Should we even try?  Would it help make better letterboxers out there and <br/>
improve the game for us all?  Am I worrying over nothing?<br/>
<br/>
Discuss, please.<br/>

<div><font size="2">I don't think you are worrying over nothing. I think people like that are a growing problem. My only hope is that they are the ones that don't participate in the hobby for very long. I think one thing each of us can do is ALWAYS point out the importance of secrecy and discreetion (and any other values) when we write up our clues, though most of us already do that, don't we? I don't know if we can make jerks stop being jerks. </font></div>
<div> </div>
<div>The question also brings me back to my sore point of publicity. If some jerk reads a newspaper article about boxing and it includes statements about how important it is to be discreet, isn't he or she going to say..........uh.......if you are so concerned about discretion, why do you have all this information and pictures here in the paper for all to read? </div>
<div> </div>
<div>Maybe the owners of AQ and LBNA (if they don't already-I haven't explored the sites lately) could have, along with all the other rules and regulations they seem to have come up with lately, a very prominent link entitled "The Importance of Discretion In Letterboxing". </div>
<div> </div>
<div>When it comes down to it, jerks are going to be jerks, no matter what you tell them to do or not to do. </div>
<div> </div>
<div>Since as someone pointed out to me in the last little "todo" we had about my statement on publicity, the horse is already out of the barn, the only thing each of us can do is always, always, stress discretion in our clues and to anyone who we know has just started boxing. And if we run into people like the ones you saw, (or at least the sober ones) take it upon ourselves to stop them and nicely and politely point out the error of their ways. If we are going to "talk the talk", we should "walk the walk". </div>

</span></blockquote>Until this past week, we could travel for well over an hour by car without ever coming <br/>
across another placer's letterboxes. Because of this, only a dozen or two newbies have <br/>
even "tried" letterboxing in my area since I have started planting. None of those who <br/>
contacted me said they came across the information because of a printed article, most <br/>
were introduced by reading about it somewhere on the internet or by a friend. There were <br/>
a couple who found my one box by mistake.<br/>
<br/>
I feel I have a certain amount of responsibility to the folks who start letterboxing in the <br/>
general area where I choose to plant. I do my best to respond in a thoughtful way to any <br/>
initial communications letting me know my letterbox was found. If I can see they are brand <br/>
new (you can usually tell on AQ), I ask if they are local, how they found out about <br/>
letterboxing and include a few helpful links for beginners that include FAQs, letterboxing <br/>
ethics, and yahoo groups. I try to make it a short note because too much information will <br/>
be overwhelming and disregarded.<br/>
<br/>
I know some folks won't agree with the need to return to their boxes unless they get a <br/>
note telling them something is wrong but I feel I have a personal responsibility to check on <br/>
them regularly. I see who has found my boxes and that they have not been left in a <br/>
trashed way that they are ruined and represent letterboxing poorly. Making sure they are <br/>
hidden "just so" gives any new boxers clear information on just how a letterbox should <br/>
look when they find their very first find. There are a few times I have noticed trends in who <br/>
stamped last and who leaves boxes partially open and it is not always newbies. One <br/>
newbie and her family, Ammie, have consistently closed and hidden my letterboxes in a <br/>
way that I was sure that I was the last one to have been there. I was so surprised to see <br/>
this group of 5 stamped into at least 6 of my letterboxes that were re-hidden exactly the <br/>
way I would have returned them. I made sure to write an e-mail to them, commending <br/>
them for their exact efforts.<br/>
<br/>
Not all folks who try letterboxing can easily be contacted. If I see who I think are a new <br/>
family or individual stamped into any of my boxes (they sometimes write "our very first <br/>
letterbox!" in the log), I try to research to find them to contact them via e-mail. Some of <br/>
these new folks don't even have stamps yet and are trying out letterboxing before <br/>
registering a name. One of the research methods I use is looking to see if they have <br/>
registered the name on geocaching.com. Another thing I do to communicate with folks <br/>
like this (or anyone who accidentally find any of my letterboxes) is to include some <br/>
attractive information sheets to encourage them to learn all of the facts and ethics. I <br/>
include a few in each letterbox so they feel free to take one with them.<br/>
<br/>
Of those 20 or so newbies whose first finds were any of our letterboxes, maybe 5 have <br/>
stuck with it for longer than a few months. I have found them to be thoughtful and <br/>
encourage their feedback. A couple of local die hards, bless their souls for putting up with <br/>
me, have finally planted a letterbox of their own. It is a quality hide with a hand carved <br/>
stamp. <br/>
<br/>
I think if we can treat the newbies of today as if they have the potential to be seasoned <br/>
boxers, the letterboxing community far and wide will reap the benefits.<br/>

newbies, and you can take our views for what they may be worth.<br/>

We were both serious outside folks before we learned enough about <br/>
letterboxing, via the article in the Philadelphia Inquirer, to become <br/>
interested.  Values such as the "Leave No Trace" ethic were already <br/>
important to us.  <br/>
<br/>
As we read the postings and find boxes, we learn more about <br/>
letterboxing.  We haven't met any other boxers yet but that will be <br/>
cool when it happens.<br/>

To me, a drunken idiot with a letterbox is no more a letterboxer than <br/>
a drunken idiot in an art museum is a connisseur.  The particular <br/>
task occupying the drunken idiot is irrelevant.  <br/>

Welcome! and this gives me an opportunity to invite you and all the other newbies out there to our next local gathering.  I had another newbie email me that they were hesitant to attend because they were new, PLEASE, do not hesitate to attend just because you are new or don't know us!! We were all new once two and got to be such goods friends by meeting and getting to know each other through the gatherings. So I am including my original post for Stampin' and Campin' which is June 9-11. You do not have to attend all three days, or even camp over night. Just stop by and say hello, or hang for the duration if you like. Hope to see lot's of new faces there!!</div> <div> </div> <div> <div>STAMPIN' and CAMPIN'</div> <div>When  June 9, 10, 11<br/>Where  Little Bennett Regional Park, Clarksburg, MD</div> <div>23701 Frederick Road</div> <div>Clarksburg, MD </div> <div><a href="http://www.mc-mncppc.org/Parks/enterprise/park_facilities/little_bennett/index.shtm" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><font color="#003399">http://www.mc-mncppc.org/Parks/enterprise/park_facilities/little_bennett/index.shtm</font></a></div> <div><font color="#003399"></font> </div> <div><br/>General B.S. - C'mon out and spend some time round the campfire under the stars with your fellow boxers. Little Bennett is within an hours or less drive of hundreds of boxes in MD, DC, VA and WV. So pick the boxes you wish to hunt during the day and then hang out for a group dinner Saturday night and breakfast Sunday morning. Anyone who arrives Friday night will be fed Saturday AM as well.<br/><br/>I have reserved site 43 for 6 people and we are now full. My chief cooks and bottle washers, Sowsewbizzy and Miz Scarlet, will be camping with me, along with a couple of other folks. Sites 44, 45, 46, and 47 are close to us us but will be rented first come, first serve. Each site can hold up
 to 6 people, no restriction on the number of tents. Rates vary on the number of nights/people you will need. The sites are in the back of loop C, remote but within walking distance of the bathhouse.<br/><br/>Dude and I will bring all of the cooking gear. Anyone who wants to donate food for either Saturday dinner or Sunday breakfast can email us at hikers_n_hounds@... <br/>We also have an extra tent if anyone would like to come but doesnt have one.<br/><br/>So sign up on Atlas Quest and come down to MD, bring your own clues. Well have good food, a roaring fire and lots of trails stories to share. Dude promises not to snore too loudly.

<div><font face="Arial" size="2"><span class="ygrps-yiv-2125132255515100921-31052006">When I attended my 
first gathering in autumn 2004 (Palmyra Cove!), I was rather anxious about 
meeting all these other boxers.  I wondered if I would fit in, if I would 
be overwhelmed by more experienced boxers and in-jokes.  Instead, I had an 
absolute blast.  Lightnin' Bug immediately took me under his buggy wing, 
and I met loads of other wonderful people, found lots of boxes, and discovered 
that this group is really a load of fun.  I've only been to one other 
gathering since, due to my schedule, but I'm happy to call many other 
mid-Atlantic boxers friends, and at least one a role model.  (You know who 
you are!  *wink*)  </span></font></div>

fantastic group of people.</span></font></div>

<div>Wow, for some reason your name looks real familiar, like you had been 
  here awhile! Welcome! and this gives me an opportunity to invite you and all 
  the other newbies out there to our next local gathering.  I had another 
  newbie email me that they were hesitant to attend because they were new, 
  PLEASE, do not hesitate to attend just because you are new or don't know us!! 
  We were all new once two and got to be such goods friends by meeting and 
  getting to know each other through the gatherings. So I am including my 
  original post for Stampin' and Campin' which is June 9-11. You do not have to 
  attend all three days, or even camp over night. Just stop by and say hello, or 
  hang for the duration if you like. Hope to see lot's of new faces 
there!!</div>

&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; So let me bring this around to a question to perhaps provoke <br/>
some discussion.  Is there <br/>
&gt; &gt; something we can do to better communicate the (very few) values <br/>
of letterboxing to <br/>
&gt; &gt; people?  Should we even try?  Would it help make better <br/>
letterboxers out there and <br/>
&gt; &gt; improve the game for us all?  Am I worrying over nothing?<br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; Discuss, please.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Until this past week, we could travel for well over an hour by car <br/>
without ever coming <br/>
&gt; across another placer's letterboxes. Because of this, only a dozen <br/>
or two newbies have <br/>
&gt; even "tried" letterboxing in my area since I have started <br/>
planting. None of those who <br/>
&gt; contacted me said they came across the information because of a <br/>
printed article, most <br/>
&gt; were introduced by reading about it somewhere on the internet or <br/>
by a friend. There were <br/>
&gt; a couple who found my one box by mistake.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I feel I have a certain amount of responsibility to the folks who <br/>
start letterboxing in the <br/>
&gt; general area where I choose to plant. I do my best to respond in a <br/>
thoughtful way to any <br/>
&gt; initial communications letting me know my letterbox was found. If <br/>
I can see they are brand <br/>
&gt; new (you can usually tell on AQ), I ask if they are local, how <br/>
they found out about <br/>
&gt; letterboxing and include a few helpful links for beginners that <br/>
include FAQs, letterboxing <br/>
&gt; ethics, and yahoo groups. I try to make it a short note because <br/>
too much information will <br/>
&gt; be overwhelming and disregarded.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I know some folks won't agree with the need to return to their <br/>
boxes unless they get a <br/>
&gt; note telling them something is wrong but I feel I have a personal <br/>
responsibility to check on <br/>
&gt; them regularly. I see who has found my boxes and that they have <br/>
not been left in a <br/>
&gt; trashed way that they are ruined and represent letterboxing <br/>
poorly. Making sure they are <br/>
&gt; hidden "just so" gives any new boxers clear information on just <br/>
how a letterbox should <br/>
&gt; look when they find their very first find. There are a few times I <br/>
have noticed trends in who <br/>
&gt; stamped last and who leaves boxes partially open and it is not <br/>
always newbies. One <br/>
&gt; newbie and her family, Ammie, have consistently closed and hidden <br/>
my letterboxes in a <br/>
&gt; way that I was sure that I was the last one to have been there. I <br/>
was so surprised to see <br/>
&gt; this group of 5 stamped into at least 6 of my letterboxes that <br/>
were re-hidden exactly the <br/>
&gt; way I would have returned them. I made sure to write an e-mail to <br/>
them, commending <br/>
&gt; them for their exact efforts.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Not all folks who try letterboxing can easily be contacted. If I <br/>
see who I think are a new <br/>
&gt; family or individual stamped into any of my boxes (they sometimes <br/>
write "our very first <br/>
&gt; letterbox!" in the log), I try to research to find them to contact <br/>
them via e-mail. Some of <br/>
&gt; these new folks don't even have stamps yet and are trying out <br/>
letterboxing before <br/>
&gt; registering a name. One of the research methods I use is looking <br/>
to see if they have <br/>
&gt; registered the name on geocaching.com. Another thing I do to <br/>
communicate with folks <br/>
&gt; like this (or anyone who accidentally find any of my letterboxes) <br/>
is to include some <br/>
&gt; attractive information sheets to encourage them to learn all of <br/>
the facts and ethics. I <br/>
&gt; include a few in each letterbox so they feel free to take one with <br/>
them.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Of those 20 or so newbies whose first finds were any of our <br/>
letterboxes, maybe 5 have <br/>
&gt; stuck with it for longer than a few months. I have found them to <br/>
be thoughtful and <br/>
&gt; encourage their feedback. A couple of local die hards, bless their <br/>
souls for putting up with <br/>
&gt; me, have finally planted a letterbox of their own. It is a quality <br/>
hide with a hand carved <br/>
&gt; stamp. <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I think if we can treat the newbies of today as if they have the <br/>
potential to be seasoned <br/>
&gt; boxers, the letterboxing community far and wide will reap the <br/>
benefits.<br/>

<div><br/></div>Speaking of new boxers and particularly e-mails....  I 
  find it <br/>disappointing to e-mail people in regards to the state of their 
  <br/>boxes, or worse yet with a question and NEVER HEAR A RESPONSE.  Two 
  <br/>instances in particular:  the flamingo stamp missing from the 
  <br/>wildlife in the park series, removed by someone mistaking it for a 
  <br/>geocache; and I wanted to ask about the squirley police box if it <br/>was 
  MIA, after trying to hunt it down a second time.  Question 
  <br/>also:  have only been letterboxing a year or so.  We've never 
  met <br/>anyone out there that we could positively ID as letterboxers.  Is 
  <br/>there any way to know if we run into one of you guys?  Is there any 
  <br/>kind of like "gang color" sort of thing or some sort of accessory or 
  <br/>apparel you all wear that says "hey, I'm a fellow letterboxer?"  
  <br/>Just curious.    <br/><br/><br/>--- In lbma@yahoogroups.com,

  for us all?  Am I worrying over nothing?<br/>&gt; &gt; <br/>&gt; &gt; 
  Discuss, please.<br/>&gt; <br/>&gt; Until this past week, we could travel for 
  well over an hour by car <br/>without ever coming <br/>&gt; across another 
  placer's letterboxes. Because of this, only a dozen <br/>or two newbies have 
  <br/>&gt; even "tried" letterboxing in my area since I have started 
  <br/>planting. None of those who <br/>&gt; contacted me said they came across 
  the information because of a <br/>printed article, most <br/>&gt; were 
  introduced by reading about it somewhere on the internet or <br/>by a friend. 
  There were <br/>&gt; a couple who found my one box by mistake.<br/>&gt; <br/>&gt; 
  I feel I have a certain amount of responsibility to the folks who <br/>start 
  letterboxing in the <br/>&gt; general area where I choose to plant. I do my 
  best to respond in a <br/>thoughtful way to any <br/>&gt; initial communications 
  letting me know my letterbox was found. If <br/>I can see they are brand 
  <br/>&gt; new (you can usually tell on AQ), I ask if they are local, how 
  <br/>they found out about <br/>&gt; letterboxing and include a few helpful links 
  for beginners that <br/>include FAQs, letterboxing <br/>&gt; ethics, and yahoo 
  groups. I try to make it a short note because <br/>too much information will 
  <br/>&gt; be overwhelming and disregarded.<br/>&gt; <br/>&gt; I know some folks 
  won't agree with the need to return to their <br/>boxes unless they get a 
  <br/>&gt; note telling them something is wrong but I feel I have a personal 
  <br/>responsibility to check on <br/>&gt; them regularly. I see who has found my 
  boxes and that they have <br/>not been left in a <br/>&gt; trashed way that they 
  are ruined and represent letterboxing <br/>poorly. Making sure they are 
  <br/>&gt; hidden "just so" gives any new boxers clear information on just 
  <br/>how a letterbox should <br/>&gt; look when they find their very first find. 
  There are a few times I <br/>have noticed trends in who <br/>&gt; stamped last 
  and who leaves boxes partially open and it is not <br/>always newbies. One 
  <br/>&gt; newbie and her family, Ammie, have consistently closed and hidden 
  <br/>my letterboxes in a <br/>&gt; way that I was sure that I was the last one 
  to have been there. I <br/>was so surprised to see <br/>&gt; this group of 5

were totally lost.  I asked if I could help them find something and <br/>
they explained the whole thing to me.  The next week, I was walking <br/>
the same trail, clues in hand and kids in tow, to find what they could <br/>
not.  A month later, I had my first box planted in the same park.<br/>

I attended my first gathering in autumn 2004 (Palmyra Cove!), I was
rather anxious about meeting all these other boxers.  I wondered if I
would fit in, if I would be overwhelmed by more experienced boxers and
in-jokes.  Instead, I had an absolute blast.  Lightnin' Bug immediately
took me under his buggy wing, and I met loads of other wonderful
people, found lots of boxes, and discovered that this group is really a
load of fun.  I've only been to one other gathering since, due to my
schedule, but I'm happy to call many other mid-Atlantic boxers friends,
and at least one a role model.  (You know who you are!  *wink*)  </span></font></div>

if you're interested, I encourage you to push past the anxiety.  This
