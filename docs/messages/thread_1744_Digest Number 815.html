                    <div id="ygrps-yiv-1374591153"><div>Hi!</div> <div> </div> <div>First, Welcome to the the group Brenda! We're glad to see more Baltimore County boxers!  We had the pleasure of finding your three Picnic in the Park boxes today, and they were a wonderful diversion!  Although the park trails are a bit confusing there, I think you did a good job with the clues. </div> <div> </div> <div>Second, Cyclonic I agree it is maddening to have boxers (new or otherwise) that just "don't get it." There are times we've had to pass by boxes because of hikers.. or we just didn't find it the first time around. Gotta hate when it's right there... and you still miss it... Sure I would love to be able to transmit information.. and not just about letterboxing.. but any type of outdoor activity (hiking, mountain biking, horseback riding... whatever) about being respectful... but I think that's a pretty hard thing to try to get to "everyone." I think there will always be a few.. and you can either (a)
 ignore it hope it goes away (b) try to do something.. i.e. say something to those involved. </div> <div> </div> <div>As far as those not involved in the "online community" and just go out and box.. I gotta say we're kinda like that sometimes. Sometimes I read messages from this local group/atlasquest.. but the majority of the time we grab clues as we have time, solve a mystery box or whatever and just head out. We really never did anything "online" our whole first year of boxing. When we found our first "hitchhiker" and didn't know... we read the FAQs to figure it out. </div> <div> </div> <div>I've met several boxers "on the trail" that I've never seen on an online group, and I think they're fine. Several like the mystery of kinda just going out.. hiking... seeing what's out there and going on thier way... I don't think there's a real difference between those that participate/don't participate in the online community.</div> <div> </div>
