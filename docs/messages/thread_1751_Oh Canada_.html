                    <div id="ygrps-yiv-1279811223"><div>I meant to post this sooner but have been buried at work since I got back. What a fabulous weekend we spent in Canada attending the Rocks, Docks and Locks Gathering hosted by Norasta and Guitarzan!! So many memories, so many highlights. Pics are in the files sections of LBMA and AQ.</div> <div> </div> <div>The Journey - I tease her mercilessly about her compulsion to organize things and people (read "bossy") but Sowsewbizzy did a wonderful job plotting out the trip. Just the right mix of drive time and boxing. We planted a box on the way in a beautiful little park in PA that was full of Lady Slippers! The first time I have seen them growing in the wild, what a treat. Hunted two boxes in a pet cemetery somewhere in NY whose graves and inscriptions brought me to tears. Then had a great dinner and found the box in a pub also in New York. We arrived at our hotel in Watertown exactly on time! At one point during the day Judy advised us we were actually running 20
 minutes ahead of schedule, woo-hoo!! We hit the hay around 11:00 and woke up rested and ready for Canada early Saturday morning.</div> <div> </div> <div>The Gathering - What a wonderful town Kingston Ontario is!! I HAVE to go back there soon. The gather site was so cool, right on the water, the ship we stayed on was awesome and we pretty much had to run of it. It was great to meet other boxers I hadn't had the pleasure of meeting before, and to see some folks I had met at the pub crawl but didn't remember clearly (it was a pub crawl after all) and to see my good buddies Jan and Miss Moon and spend time with Pete and Wanda. The weather was perfect and the company sublime.</div> <div> </div> <div>Saturday night after the gathering Norasta and Guitarzan took us out for the BEST POST GATHERING DINNER EVER!! There we were in the upstairs room at the Kingston Brewing Co. pub when in walk about 20-25 men, mostly young. One of them comes over to our table wearing a
 T-shirt that reads "Paul-apalooza" and says he's apologizing in advance but they are having a bachelor party for his twin brother Paul and there will be a lot of drinking and foul language. Well, we all shout "All right!!!" and when he sees what good sports we are (read Party Animals) he introduces himself and several friends. We are told when Paul comes in, dressed in a hot pink mini-skirt and ladies underpants we are to clap real loud...and we did. And hooted and hollered and signed his panties, and posed for pictures and basically had way too much fun at the bachelor party. What a blast! Saturday evening the festivities continued in our cabin where we had "enhanced" the portrait of Queen Liz by adding a Red Hat to it! Lot's of folks stopped by and chatted until Miz Scarlet kicked everyone out as she and her son Mambo Dog were wiped out, so the rest of us moved to the galley and partied a little longer.</div> <div> </div> <div>Sunday - Sowsewbizzy and
 Sheba were itchin' to get down to some serious boxing. I wanted to meander around town for some of those boxes. Miz Scarlet also wanted to stay in town to be near the ship as poor Mambo Dog, her son, was up all night with a stomach bug. So we split into two groups and everyone had a great time enjoying the day in their own way. Two highlights of the day for me were stumbling across a little outdoor cafe in an enchanting little alley that was full of sunlight, flowers and artists. The food was great, the atmosphere fantastic and Miz Scarlet and I felt like we could stay there all day. Later that evening Pete stopped by for a visit in what had now become our annex, the galley, and we killed of a bottle of wine and had a great visit. I was so impressed with his description of several boxes we mentioned. Pete and Wanda have now found over 10,000 boxes. But when we mentioned a little one here or there he still remembered the stamp or log details, or described the trail to us. I
 can barely remember a box I planted a year ago well enough to post the clues that I lost and here Pete is telling trail stories, 10,000 boxes later, with great accuracy! Amazing.</div> <div> </div> <div>Monday - Back home again - boo! Fortunately Mambo Dog was feeling a lot better so we did a little boxing and planting before we left town than pretty much headed home. Sheba and Sowsewbizzy were in a separate vehicle and did some additional boxing on their ride home. Miz Scarlet, Mambo Dog and I were too pooped and just boogied south. </div> <div> </div> <div>I will never forget the weekend, the people, the fun I had in Kingston. Thank you to Norasta and Guitarzaneveryone for such a wonderful time and such priceless memories. </div> <div> </div> <div>Now on to Maryland next weekend for Stampin' and Campin'! I wonder if there are any bachelor parites happening at the campground.....</div><p>
