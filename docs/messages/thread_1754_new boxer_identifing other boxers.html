of Mizscarlet's boxes.  The muttering, the paper, and the backpack <br/>
along a trail on the Main Line were all giveaways - only thing that <br/>
could have made it clearer would be a compass in a residential area.<br/>
<br/>
The exchange was with a family that had started letterboxing that <br/>
morning.  The kids were amazed to see some of the stamps in our <br/>
journal (Dad liked "Ode to a Good Joe"), and they loved the dog <br/>
stamps that they had already found.  We gave them a few ideas about <br/>
Web sites to check.<br/>

&gt;   And guess what else--I met boxers on the trail TODAY!  I went to <br/>
check on my Into the Woods series and ran into the Smiths, AKA Attack <br/>
Box Troop, just as they found the last box.  They don't have a stamp <br/>
yet but all signed my logbook.... <br/>

I don't wear letterboxing regalia while letterboxing because I occasionally need some <br/>

"Looking for a letterbox."<br/>
"A what?!"<br/>
..and three days of staking out the lobby of a major US corporation go down the drain.<br/>
<br/>
I am always reminded of the tale of the couple who went in search of the letterbox in the <br/>
Smithsonian.  When it wasn't there, they asked a guard about it.  He helped them search <br/>
until they found a letterboxer in mid-stamp-in with the box.  Then the guard confiscated <br/>
the box. (There is another version of the story involving Homeland Security and a body-<br/>
cavity search afterwards, but I'll stick to the more plausible story.)<br/>

And IMHO it's a little like wearing <br/>the <br/>&gt; T-<br/>&gt; &gt; shirt of the band your <br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; playing in on stage. No judgements here, just my own twisted <br/>&gt; &gt; mores in play.<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; <br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; Perhaps that's why I am more than a little frustrated <br/>&gt; with 'boxers <br/>&gt; &gt; who 'fess up right off the <br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; bat. <br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; <br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; "What are you doing in there?"<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; "Looking for a letterbox."<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; "A what?!"<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; ..and three days of staking out the lobby of a major US <br/>&gt; &gt; corporation go down the
 drain.<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; <br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; I am always reminded of the tale of the couple who went in <br/>&gt; search <br/>&gt; &gt; of the letterbox in the <br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; Smithsonian. When it wasn't there, they asked a guard about <br/>&gt; it. <br/>&gt; &gt; He helped them search <br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; until they found a letterboxer in mid-stamp-in with the box. <br/>&gt; Then <br/>&gt; &gt; the guard confiscated <br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; the box. (There is another version of the story involving <br/>&gt; Homeland <br/>&gt; &gt; Security and a body-<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; cavity search afterwards, but I'll stick to the more plausible <br/>&gt; &gt; story.)<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; <br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; So as the resident curmudgeon, may I suggest that there are <br/>&gt; times <br/>&gt; &gt; for being "campground <br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; friendly" and times for playing it cool.<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; <br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; My .02<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; <br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; Natt-<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt;
