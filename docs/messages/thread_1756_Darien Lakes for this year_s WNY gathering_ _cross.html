going to be at Darien Lakes State Park (since I don't want us to lose <br/>
out on campsites...check here to take a look <br/>
<a href="http://nysparks.state.ny.us/parks/info.asp?parkID=63)" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://nysparks.state.ny.us/parks/info.asp?parkID=63)</a>. We originally <br/>
planned to try Allegheny SP to get more of our Penna friends up with <br/>
us, but that didn't work out. Hope to still see some of you there! <br/>
<br/>
This will be like Fear Faketor...a day event of boxing on Saturday <br/>
for those who want to come in and out without staying on site and a <br/>
two night camping event with night boxing for those who want to stay <br/>
overnight (Friday will be just a check in night, while Saturday will <br/>
be some night boxing and more hang out time). The theme will be <br/>
amusement park based, but we will NOT be at the park...anyone <br/>
interested can certainly go, though!<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, I need to know ASAP how many people are planning on staying <br/>
overnight (at least on Saturday) so I can reserve some sites and get <br/>
a set of boxes for the night event. Let me know ASAP if you're <br/>
interested (and let me know if you want to donate boxes to the event)!<br/>
