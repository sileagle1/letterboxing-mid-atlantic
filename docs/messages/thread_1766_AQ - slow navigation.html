<div><font face="Arial" size="2">I have been having chronic problems at AQ. When I 
try to navigate between pages or send replys to emails the site becomes bogged 
down. I get frustrated and end up not using the site at all and that's too 
bad because I really like some of the features.<br/>I have tried to contact the 
Webmaster but the letter would not get sent. Does anyone know what 
the problem is and is it fixable?  I cannot reply to any of the emails 
that people have sent me at my AQ mailbox. I apologize for this. It's not my 
fault - from now on contact me directly at the email address below.</font></div>

On a related note, if you try to use the site during off-peak times,<br/>
the sluggishness of the site can be greatly reduced. *nodding* Using<br/>
the site after ten o'clock at night or before eight in the morning,<br/>
you'll get better performance. Not great, perhaps, but definitely better.<br/>

Great time to make an NPR-like request. <br/>
<br/>
It's that time of the year folks.  Ryan works a gajillion hours to <br/>
keep Atlasquest the finely performing machine that it is.  Tons of <br/>
bells and whistles, with features for everyone.  <br/>
<br/>
We can do our part with a measly membership of only $24 a year:  <br/>
<a href="http://www.atlasquest.com/marketplace/subscribe/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.atlasquest.com/marketplace/subscribe/</a><br/>
<br/>
It is really that simple, and nice of us to pay for the added <br/>
bandwidth Ryan and AQ need.<br/>
<br/>
If you check Atlasquest even weekly (and who are we kidding--many of <br/>
us check daily or more), isn't it worth the $2 a month?<br/>
<br/>
You can get up to date weather reports for the box you want to find.<br/>
<br/>
Locate other boxes near the one you are pursuing.<br/>
<br/>
Pull down clues into your PDA.<br/>
<br/>
Converse with other letterboxers.<br/>
<br/>
Fight communism.<br/>
<br/>
Won't you join now?  Don't be a afraid, PayPal today.<br/>
<br/>
Returning to your normal LBMA station...<br/>

subscribers to help cover the extra costs I'm anticipating. Those who<br/>
are already subscribed can continue paying the rate it was at when<br/>
they first signed up (which is probably why you're seeing $24 on that<br/>
page).<br/>

thing is a moving target--it's possible for the site to be busy after<br/>
that time, and possible for activity to drop off before that time.<br/>

been a fairly recent thing. What operating system and browser are you<br/>

perhaps trying a different browser will work better.<br/>
<br/>
Today the site has been running pretty well. Not sure if that's<br/>
because of the changes I made last night or if it's just that AQ<br/>
hasn't been particularly busy today, but--knock on wood--I haven't<br/>
logged much bogging down today. *shrug*<br/>
