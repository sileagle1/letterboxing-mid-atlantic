Howdy ya'll! <br/>
<br/>
I have not been active in letterboxing for over a year now. I allowed <br/>
life to dictate what I could and could not have time for.<br/>
<br/>
I am currently taking on a project as part of a course I am taking. I <br/>
decided to challenge myself to become active again in the <br/>
letterboxing community by taking on this project. But I cannot do it <br/>
alone. The project involves creating several series of boxes for some <br/>
local Girl Scout Camps. Yes these would be private boxes targeted at <br/>
this community as a way of introducint the joys of letterboxing to <br/>
girls.<br/>
What I am looking for are folks to help carve stamps, folks that <br/>
would be willing to go to a camp and help plant the boxes and write <br/>
the clues, and people that would be willing to be an "expert" in the <br/>
fall to introduce letterboxing to girls at troop meetings. <br/>
<br/>
Interested? Please contact me off list as I do not read the list <br/>
often and may miss a reply here at <a href="mailto:samitchell@..." rel="nofollow" target="_blank">samitchell@...</a>. If you want <br/>
to do any one part to make this project a success, your talent and <br/>
time will be well spent. <br/>
Thank you for listening... and I look forward to getting back out on <br/>
the trails seeking boxes and running into you!<br/>
<br/>
