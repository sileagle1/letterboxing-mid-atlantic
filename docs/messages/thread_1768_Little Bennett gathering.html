so close to home. I gave DH the choice of which we would do.. the <br/>
letterboxing camp weekend OR the maryland ornithological bird watchers <br/>
conference (held the same weekend).He trumped me by producing an <br/>
invitation to his boss's bonfire bbq held saturday. <br/>

We had such fun last year and my kids still talk about last year's <br/>
picnic. (they were talking about it this morning.. 'remember the <br/>
penguin patrol? remember the dead duck stamp??' remember the chinese <br/>
food?)<br/>
<br/>
I will replace the Cuppa Joe letterbox that is not far away (in <br/>
germantown) if anyone wants to stop by and stamp in that one. <br/>
(Germantown, Maryland) It will be up by midday friday<br/>
