They look just great.I have just a couple of extra's in short sleeve and tank styles so you might want to bring a little money in case you see something you like. If not, I am sure I'll sell them off eventually. Most of you will recieve them this weekend at the gathering OR I will begin shipping next week to those of you who have paid for shipping. Thanks so much to everyone who participated and now I can get a little sleep before the gathering this weekend! Um, that's after I get the guidebook done, sort the tee shirts, go up to Washington Crossing to find my missing box, pack, and about a million other things!! Hope to see you there,</div>
