but I won't be staying over night... I had such a nice tent site at <br/>
the Hampton Suites!!!... but alas ... I have to be back in Lake Ridge <br/>
by sunset... (This is my last weekend before heading to Peru for two <br/>
weeks)<br/>
<br/>
I'd like to hike the the three mile loop in the Wildlife Preserve at <br/>
the end of Ten Mile Creek Road...the remote auxillary section of Black <br/>
Hills . I did this hike last year and got four great Tempus Fugit <br/>
Birder Series boxes but now I understand there are at least six other <br/>
boxes in there. (ten total)<br/>
<br/>
Anybody interested in taking this hike with me meet at the trail head <br/>
at noon or email me.</div>
