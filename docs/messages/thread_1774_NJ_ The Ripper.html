U built it for M, or maybe it was it Y for P,<br/>
It's been so long, it's faded from memory.<br/>
From the parking lot go west,<br/>
Cross the lawn, that would be best.<br/>
Now locate the picnic table,<br/>
Find the avian's home, if you're able.<br/>
Starting from that spot,<br/>
Go 9 paces directly north, it's not a lot.<br/>
At the base of the tree, is what you seek, <br/>
Make sure no one is watching, so they don't get a peek.<br/>
The tiny stamp is in a fake piece of granite,<br/>
Take out your logbook, so you can stamp it. <br/>
<br/>
If you find this letterbox please make sure to log it on <br/>
letterboxing.org or atlasquest.com as I have no way of knowing if <br/>
you found it or not unless you do.</div>
