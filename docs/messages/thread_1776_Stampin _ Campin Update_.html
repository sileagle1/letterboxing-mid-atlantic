                    <div id="ygrps-yiv-1842563937">OK, first off, its about 10:30 PM and we just got home from a <br/>
suprise drop in at the event......We hiked about 2 miles to the <br/>
campsite fron Route 121, to pop in and shock the folks there.  That <br/>
was at 4pm est.  Upon showing up, we SHOCKED a few there..mainly <br/>
Hikers and Hounds, Dude, Ms Scarlet, and Cyclonic......after a few <br/>
minutes of guessing, they figured me out.  Soon folks came pouring <br/>
in.  some old friends, and some great new ones.   I wanna thank the <br/>
following:<br/>
<br/>
1) HnH.....nice job on the event, and the look on your face was <br/>
priceless upon my arival!<br/>
2) Ms Scarlet....thanks for figuring it out.<br/>
3) GeckoSpot and Poison Ivy for the beers when ours were <br/>
out....Gecko, you are a funny one, and loved chatting.  <br/>
4) Ivy, the look on your face was priceless as well, and evjoyed our <br/>
little sit down, and I hope to get things going asap for that 3 <br/>
lettered word...alos, thanks for accepting to plant a box for me in <br/>
the future...its yours, do as ya wish, Its an honor.<br/>
5) Cyclonic, for the ride back to our parked car on the side of the <br/>
road at dark.  Saved us some time, and some energy.<br/>
6) Funky Feline, and Spidey....I have chatted with FF on AIM a lot <br/>
the past few months, and am nothing but impressed with you, and <br/>
spidey.  Was a pleasure to meet you, and sorry I was so busy <br/>
exchanging to hang out more.  You guys are great, and have held a <br/>
secret for a little while, and have been awesome!...Me and my wife <br/>
really enjoyed you guys, and would like to offer an invite to a <br/>
dinner one night nearby.  <br/>
7) Tempus Fugit......Again, the look on your face was also <br/>
priceless, and its great to meet you.....Was a true pleasure<br/>
8) F &amp; R...great chatting with you, and great to see ya look foward <br/>
to some boxes in Northern VA.......thanks for your time.<br/>
9) Gallant Rogue.....wish ya were there, I came early...and thought <br/>
I might catch ya....One day soon we hike the AT, and have some fun.<br/>
10) sewsobussy....Judy, thanks for not killing me!..and actually <br/>
getting me a chair.....fit for a king!<br/>
<br/>
my appearance made many cuss, many scream, but all were shocked!<br/>
<br/>
That is what BullDawg does!<br/>
<br/>
Thanks again to all, and sorry I had to leave so fast....but the <br/>
first plan was to hike in for 5 min, and hike out.."BullDawg" style, <br/>
but you are a great bunch of people, and was hard to leave.....never <br/>
thought I'd be so busy, stamping if logbooks...it was crazy, sorry <br/>
If i forgot anyone!</div>
