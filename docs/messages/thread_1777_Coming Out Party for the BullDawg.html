fun and not without surprises.  Since HnH hosted this casual affair, <br/>
whodda thought she'd have this mysterious boxer actual come out and <br/>
be unveiled!!!<br/>
<br/>
The merriment went on with visitors from all 6 LBMA states and CT.  <br/>
It was a great turn out . . . even if we only had two authorized <br/>
parking spaces at the gather/camp site.  So RedHat Cab was making <br/>
runs to and fro from the satellite parking for day trippers.  At <br/>
least those quick to react got their $5 entrance/parking fee back!<br/>
<br/>
Meeting so many new folks keep the exchanges going for some time <br/>
while the delectable chicken grilled - thanks Irene/poultry princess <br/>
and Rusty/grill master. <br/>
<br/>
Sunday breakfast was an early AM affair in order to break camp.  <br/>
Hopefully the Swedish Egg Coffee kept the drivers awake for the trip <br/>
home. . . I should have had a 3rd cup or more than 3 hrs sleep.<br/>
<br/>
Sat Lois Lane met and hiked with us in preparation for a freelance <br/>
Games Magazine article.  HnH had strict guidelines about what could <br/>
and could not be in an article.  I just hope LL didn't lose her job <br/>
at the Post or get a speeding ticket when her keys were left in my <br/>
car and I was on high seeking a true rara avis.  Fortunately a <br/>
Gallant Rogue happened by on his descent and retrieved my keys in <br/>
order to release LL's keys from the car.  I suspect her first points <br/>
of Letterboxing will be wear proper attire and don't lock the keys in <br/>
the car.  Thanks to MizScarlet LL even had a trail stamp.<br/>
<br/>
Guess I better go review my pics and exchanges so names and faces are <br/>
linked.  And then I'll get some posted. <br/>
<br/>
Thanks Irene for a great gather - at just the right speed.<br/>
