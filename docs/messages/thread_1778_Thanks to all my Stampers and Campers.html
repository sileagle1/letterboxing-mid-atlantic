While some arrivals caused more of a stir than others, Bulldawg comes to mind, we were thrilled when each one of you showed up. The weather was perfect and so was the company.  Special thanks to everyone who brought something to share and to my two cooks, Rusty from Team J&amp;R, who saved us all from eating raw chicken. ( I kept telling him it was done, he kept showing me why it wasn't, good catch!) and Sowsewbizzy for Sunday pancakes. SSB also did double duty as the parking gestapo (You vill moof your car unt you vill like it!!) which kept us out of hotwater with the park police. And cheerfully shuttled everyone to and from their vehicles all weekend. Thanks so much. Miz Scarlet's event stamp, based on a tee shirt we fell in love with in Canada, totally rocked. And it was such a pleasure camping with everyone who stayed at the park with
 us.</div> <div> </div> <div>Well, Dude is completely zonked on the couch. Looks like I am unpacking by myself again. Thanks to all. </div> <div> </div> <div>Irene and Dude the Wonder Dog - Hikers and Hounds</div> <div> </div><p> __________________________________________________<br/>Do You Yahoo!?<br/>Tired of spam?
