I REALLY Enjoyed visiting and meeting some letterboxers this past <br/>
Saturday.<br/>
<br/>
I could only stay for a short bit, and made myself NOT go out and <br/>
letterbox while there, so I could meet some boxers.<br/>
<br/>
I was NOT disappointed.  I meet quite a few boxers that I've never met <br/>
before and had a joy of a time.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks!<br/>

Miles of Smiles is a ssb traveling box.  Where I travel it <br/>
travels . . . until I leave the Pirate from Every Port in Sept, then <br/>
it gets dumped off in Norwalk CT  . . . now if I can find the <br/>
Pepperidge Farm HQ in Norwalk, hmmm.<br/>
It started in Kingston ON because the gather was on the water.  Fish <br/>
and Multi-Colors you can figure out for yourself.  Then it went to <br/>
Wandering in Wonderland, Stamp'n'Camp'n', and next Pirate gather.  <br/>
The box should be pretty well beat to a pulp by then.<br/>
<br/>
Swedish Egg Coffee is a "table treat" -  both in a cup and in a log.  <br/>
Anything sitting on a gather table is what I call a "table treat".  I <br/>
don't know if there is an official term.  You'll need to query Spring <br/>
Chick.<br/>
<br/>
Let me know if there is anything else I can't answer.<br/>
