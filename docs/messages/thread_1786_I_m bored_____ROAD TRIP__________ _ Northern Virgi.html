the stampin' and Campin' Gather!! My Father's Day wish was to take <br/>
off for the weekend and box. Wish granted. I want to hit Cacapon <br/>
State Park/West Virginia area and/or head down Shenandoah Valley <br/>
along Rt. 81.   I can't leave until 7 a.m. on Sat. morning since I am <br/>
on call at the hospital until then. Winchester would basically be my <br/>
center of operations. I leave from Leesburg, Va.<br/>
 So...I put it to this group to give itinerary suggestions. This is a <br/>
slash and dash idea, so nothing grossly long, like say... some of my <br/>
boxes or Bulldawg's. I have to plant a box in Upperville first thing <br/>
in the trip, then I'll head toward Winchester. Cacapon State Park is <br/>
ripe for boxes and I would like to head there, but I need campground <br/>
ideas. Shenandoah is beautiful, and I love that area. Lots of <br/>
options! I've been looking up stuff throughout the day, and thought I <br/>
would ask for input. No hotels-just a simple campsite. All ideas are <br/>
welcome.<br/>
  If Bulldawg goes, it would be an opportunity to physically verify <br/>
that we are not one and the same if you wish to meet for an exchange. <br/>
Until then...the question still begs for some. <br/>
  Since this is a very specific area I'm looking at, responses will <br/>
probably be best sent to me off-line if preferred. I will post my <br/>
journey after the weekend, though it is my  custom not to report what <br/>
boxes I find except to the placer, unless told to do so. I wish you <br/>
all safe trails.<br/>
