weekend road trip has turned into another Canine Caper. Bulldawg and I <br/>
will be roaming the Virginia/West Virginia countryside in search of <br/>
elusive treasures. We will stop in the evening on Saturday to set up <br/>
camp and grill steaks and maintain the standards of the fine upstanding <br/>
brew hounds that we are.<br/>
  Bulldawg has begun carving new treasures, and I have  one or two to <br/>
be placed as well. Cacapon State Park weighs heavy right now with <br/>
surrounding boxes in view. Thought I would be hearing from Family Man <br/>
for input by now. Shenandoah scenery figures nicely for camping as <br/>
well. We will, of course, be thinking only of our children as we <br/>
galavant(sp?) throughout the Virginia countrysides. Safe trails.<br/>
