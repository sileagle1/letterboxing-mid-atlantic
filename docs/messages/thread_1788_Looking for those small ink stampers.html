I also buy them locally at the Dick Blick that is a 15 minute walk <br/>
from home.  That is where I happened to get the daubers.  I also <br/>
purchased some of the refill ink for my personal stamp online so that <br/>
I would not need to purchase new stamp pads every time I ran out of <br/>
my colors.<br/>
<br/>
They are all pigment, so they will not run if wet.<br/>

Hope this helps,<br/>
