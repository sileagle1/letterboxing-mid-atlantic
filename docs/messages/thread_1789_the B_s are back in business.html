chores are reduced thanks to growing grass, so we are finally back on <br/>
the trails.  We had a couple of hours yesterday afternoon to do the <br/>
Turkey Swamp Challenge in central NJ.  The best part of all was that <br/>
the smallest B hiked the 1.5 mile trail by himself.  Sweet rest for my <br/>
back.<br/>
<br/>
When asked to write about his plans for the summer, B#2 wrote "I am <br/>
going letterboxing."  Can't have any better plan than that, in our <br/>
opinion. Hope to see some of you on the trails, and definitely at the <br/>
DE gather in the fall.  We will be coming up with new signature stamps <br/>
soon and a whole new series is in the works, so we have our work cut <br/>
(carved?) out for us.<br/>
