<br/>
Just wanted to let you know that Team Lightnin' Bug expects to be <br/>
there (and not too square!!) on Saturday, July 10.  We have taken a <br/>
tour of the Southland (Nashville to Western KY) and have had a chance <br/>
to exchange stamps and HH's with She Who Plants of Nashville.  We <br/>
have some totally cool HH's to bring back including one that is <br/>
circular (created by the creative She) and one with a riddle that <br/>
holds the key to 10 mystery unpublished boxes in NY State!<br/>
<br/>
Did not have time to box Western KY (where we were working), but <br/>
maybe next time!<br/>
<br/>
TTFN,<br/>
