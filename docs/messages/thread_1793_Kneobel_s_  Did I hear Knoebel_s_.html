Anyway, my gathering is indeed on the 23rd this year.Â  I am working out
the details, I have to call the park because I want to see if I can get
the pavilion changed, they stuck us in B, but I would rather have G as
it is close to the campground and more secluded.Â  I will book sites in
the coming weeks.Â  If you would like to book a site, I would suggest a
site along Texas Ave. in the park.Â  Book now, we found out last year
that the sites go quickly.Â  I should haveÂ  a full web page with all the
details up in the next week or so, along with the "official"
announcement.<br/>

We'll miss you and you'll miss the fun!  Well, maybe a different kind <br/>
of fun.  Enjoy the Coasting Crazies.<br/>
<br/>
But it is a fair exchange - I will find it difficult to squeeze <br/>
Knoebel's in between the CT Pirate gather and DE Games...since I'll <br/>
have a lot of last minute prep to do (like cleaning for house guests.)<br/>
<br/>
Just got back from a week of plant plotting in Kent and Sussex <br/>
Counties.  There will be a mix of easy and challenging clues - drive <br/>
bys and hikes.  In fact I am working on my DE State Parks Trail <br/>
Challenge while I'm scouting plant locations.  Need to hike 15 <br/>
designated trails (38+ miles) to get the Golden Boot Award.  6 of the <br/>
trails will be on DE Games route.  The others are in New Castle County.<br/>
<br/>
Back to downloading pictures of tree trunks and stumps (part of my <br/>
clue notes.)<br/>
