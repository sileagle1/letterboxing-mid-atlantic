on boxes, but found some cool ones.  Thanks to HnH for pointing us to <br/>
the Lazy A campground.....was perfect for us.  And thanks to Poison <br/>
Ivy, for letting us invade his house so early the following <br/>
morning...still gotta get our minds together on a project.   Other <br/>
than a brief battle with road-sickness, things were smooth.  We'll be <br/>
back.....Added a box for you guys out there in Cacapon State Park....<br/>
<br/>
Still bummed I didnt see any guys playing banjos on their porches, but <br/>
did hear a guy cranking the theme from "Dukes of Hazzard" at the <br/>
campsite....a true classic moment.<br/>
<br/>
Yeeeee-Haaaawww!</div>

hear banjo music."  BTW, I'm from WV and I heard banjos all weekend -- <br/>
