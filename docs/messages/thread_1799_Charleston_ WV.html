                    <div id="ygrps-yiv-228476398">Relatively speaking, Charleston is a small town.  however, I grew up <br/>
in Bear Swamp, PA, which was literally a swamp.  Last house on a dead <br/>
end road next to a state gameland.  nearest neighbor was about a mile <br/>
away, and it was my aunt!  So, Charleston is kind of big for me -- <br/>
more city than I'm interested in being near, but we are stuck here for <br/>
awhile.  Might as well make the most of it.  I want to move to <br/>
Marlinton some day.<br/>
<br/>
Like I said, we are just getting into letterboxing.  How does one host <br/>
a gathering?  What's involved?<br/>

Before you select your date you should check out the events link on Atlasquest to make sure you're not picking the same date as another local gathering.

Sowsewbizzy is hosting a huge Games themed gathering in DE in October as well.Scarab did a Mid-Winter Ice Breaker for a couple of years but decided not to hold it last year so as not to effect Poison Ivy's Pub Crawl. Natty Bumppo has hosted a Road Rally the last 2 springs.  Several boxers worked together to bring us a Circus gathering and a Mystery gathering that were both incredible. I've hosted 3
 very low key gatherings, I'm just too damn lazy to put much effort into it. My method is to select an area I like a lot with lot's of boxes already there and just pick a date. I love to camp so we've done that at two of my gatherings.</div> <div> </div> <div>Your best bet would be to suggest several dates on this list, or post a poll, and see what most folks pick. Then you can ask folks to donate stamps or boxes that you can pre-plant and post clues. OR you can carve and plant yourself. You can pick a theme, or not. Both Atlas Quest and Silent Doug's website, <a href="http://www.letterboxing.info" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">www.letterboxing.info</a> have lot's of help on this subject. But do what YOU want to do. That way your gathering will be like no one elses. It doesn't have to be big, or thematic. Anytime you get a couple of letterboxers together everyone has a great time. </div> <div> </div> <div>We've got the greatest bunch of people on this list who
 enthusiastically support each other and our efforts. Figure out what you want to do, when you want to do it.

March - nothing scheduled then, as yet.  Since I haven't been to WV - <br/>
I wouldn't want to miss this gather!  <br/>
