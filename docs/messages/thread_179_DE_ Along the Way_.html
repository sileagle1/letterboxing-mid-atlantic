Along the Way box at Port Mahon, DE. It has been quite some time<br/>
since I have heard of a successful find on this box. Wondering if<br/>
there is anyone reading the list who has found this one lately, and<br/>
if so when? Also if there is anyone in that area who found the box<br/>
previously and would be willing to check on its status, please e-<br/>
mail me off list. Thanks!<br/>
