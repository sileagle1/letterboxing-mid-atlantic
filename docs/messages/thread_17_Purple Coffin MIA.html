<div>Just wanted to let everyone know that the Purple Coffin box in Playwicki Park in Middletown, PA seems to have gone MIA.  I went looking for it this past weekend and only found a piece of paper explaining letterboxing where the box should have been.  I searched the area, but had no luck in finding it, though there was still some snow on the ground that could have been covering it.  I contacted Team Kelly, owners of the box, but haven't heard back from this.</div>

<div>The park's other box, Going Batty, was right where it was supposed to be.</div>
