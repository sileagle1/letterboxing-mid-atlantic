The following is the offical announcement.<br/>
<br/>
Come on out to the second annual Knoebels Gatherin', held at Knoebels <br/>
Amusement Resort in Elysburg, PA.  We will be gathering at 9AM in picnic <br/>
pavilion T this year for some good times with friends old and new.  At <br/>
noon you can go ride the rides, or sit back and enjoy the day.<br/>
<br/>
Admission to the park is FREE, as is parking, so come just for the day, <br/>
or better yet, spend the entire weekend kampin' at the campground right <br/>
next to the park.<br/>
<br/>
For campers, there will be a special nighttime letterboxing series for <br/>
you to enjoy.  Reserve your site by calling 570-672-9555.  The Gatherin' <br/>
Camp HQ will be at site T-15, along Texas Ave, so be sure to call early <br/>
to get a site nearby, while there are still plenty left!<br/>
<br/>
A Gatherin' Guide will soon be avalible at <br/>
www.penncoasters.com/letterboxing.htm where you will find clues to all <br/>
the local "known" letterboxes (there are some mysteries out there) as <br/>
well as schedules and directions.<br/>

we aren't riding on them at the time.<br/>
