get it in today.  I was informed today our goal is 100 boxes by <br/>
Labor Day.<br/>
<br/>
Started at Holmdel Park &amp; Arboretum in central NJ.  Great place, <br/>
especially for kids.  Longstreet Farm, a working 1890s farm, is <br/>
right next to the Arboretum.  Who knew pigs were so BIG? An original <br/>
Martian Maggot box is your reward on the Park hike.  It has been <br/>
there 3 years but very few visitors since planted.  Dunno why, <br/>
because it is a nice walk.<br/>
<br/>
Also sought out Rick's Lost Boxes.  Great stamp!  Cooled off <br/>
afterward in the sprayground in the same park.  For anyone boxing <br/>
with kids in the summer (or maybe just borrow one or two), bring the <br/>
swimsuits along so you don't miss this.  A whole area filled with <br/>
dumping buckets, sprayers, fountains, you name it, and best of all <br/>
it's free.<br/>
<br/>
Happy boxing to all this weekend -- hopefully it dries out a little <br/>
on Sunday so all is not lost.<br/>
