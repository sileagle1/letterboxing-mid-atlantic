<br/>
Yesterday I went to the Mermaid Parade at Coney Island.  I can't really <br/>
discribe it, it is just something that has to be experianced.<br/>
<br/>
While there, much to the joy of you Gotham boxers, I planted a new box, <br/>
a tiny, tiny little thing called the "Coney Island Mermaid."  Clues can <br/>
be found here:<br/>
<br/>
<a href="http://www.penncoasters.com/letterboxing/mermaid.htm" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.penncoasters.com/letterboxing/mermaid.htm</a><br/>
<br/>
It is also listed on Atlas Quest.<br/>
<br/>
On the way home there was a break in the rain just long enough for me to <br/>
find Rick in Boca's "Home Away from Home" <br/>
(<a href="http://www.atlasquest.com/lboxes/clue.html?gBoxId=13748)" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.atlasquest.com/lboxes/clue.html?gBoxId=13748)</a>.  It was in <br/>
pretty good shape, though some ants have taken up residence under it.<br/>
<br/>
Funny story-<br/>
<br/>
On my way to Great Adventure last week I stopped to check on my "Tanx" <br/>
letterbox (<a href="http://www.penncoasters.com/letterboxing/tanx.htm)" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.penncoasters.com/letterboxing/tanx.htm)</a>.  I pulled <br/>
up to find they had recently done some landscaping in the area, and even <br/>
put in an electrical box right under where my letterbox is!  After <br/>
cursing a few times I went and took a look, and much to my astonishment <br/>
the box was still there.  I crack it open, take a look at the logbook, <br/>
and find this note, "Thanks, ________ City Parks Crew." (I can't give <br/>
away WHERE it is, now can I?)  COOL, they left the box and even wrote a <br/>
note, very nice.<br/>
<br/>
Not at my Zenith-<br/>
<br/>
OK, I know where the box is (really, honest), so last weekend I was <br/>
headed to my sisters' place and decided to pop across the state line and <br/>
pick up Zenith.  Just one problem, I remembered the clues (a rarity in <br/>
itself), but forgot the map.  I drove around figuring I woulf figure it <br/>
out, but after a while gave up for a go at it some other time.  When I <br/>
got home that night, I looked at my map, and stupid me drove past the <br/>
location THREE TIMES!  Major D'uh!  Well, it will at least make Death <br/>
Moose happy to here this.<br/>
