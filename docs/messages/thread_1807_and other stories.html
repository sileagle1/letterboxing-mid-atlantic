Life Imitates Boxing<br/>
<br/>
I have this stamp that I carved a year ago, but never found a good <br/>
home for.  It's a kite and one of my best carvings to date.  Too nice <br/>
to lose to HH-dom says I, so I plan this little journal-like scenario <br/>
for clues about wanting to go to the beach and fly a kite, but it's <br/>
too late in the day to drive, go I somewhere along the way.  Find a <br/>
nice spot, and the kite soon gets eaten by a tree, at the roots of <br/>
which would sit a yet-to-be-carved "Kite-Eating Tree" stamp.  <br/>
<br/>
Wouldn't you know, I went boxing last week and took the stamp and box <br/>
along just in case there was a good place to hide what I had.  One of <br/>
the brood asked to bring a kite.  Took the carving kit to play with <br/>
while we admired the kite in the air.  The above scnerio played out <br/>
exactly as I what dreamed it up, except that there were no places to <br/>
put a box.  Went home and carved stamp number two.  It must be fate!</div>
