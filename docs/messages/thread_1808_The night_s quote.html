Wink-  Is that a tornado comming at us?!?!?!?!???   (and it was)<br/>

Bulldawg-  Ahhhhh, we're SAFE!!  We're in a BAR!!!<br/>

We look forward to, again, laughing as hard as we did with people that <br/>
have become a permanent part of our lives.  Big Thanks to Koyote for <br/>

dangerous combination.  We could get things done.  Lots of beautiful <br/>
