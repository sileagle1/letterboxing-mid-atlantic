It cost about seventy cents an hour (plus cervesas) I managed to <br/>
plant a letterbox on the Inca Trail and have one more to plant <br/>
tomorrow. To my knowledge this is the first letterbox in the <br/>
country... which is kind of hard to believe because there are so <br/>
many hikers here from all over the world. The Inca Trail makes the <br/>
Appalachian Trail´s Roller Coaster seem easy.... but I´m glad I <br/>
hiked the that part of the AT for practice... the altitude here is <br/>
absolutely brutal. I´m at about 11,000 feet now.  Allow at least <br/>
three or four days to adjust to the thin air before starting the IT. <br/>
Today I am resting up from 10 rough days of travelling around Peru. <br/>
I have a ton of pictures from my primary target... Machu Pichu... <br/>
but alas... my camera has been borrowed ... and I don´t know by <br/>
whom... so I lost many other picures... will have a gallery of <br/>
photos somewhere next week when I return... but if you want to check <br/>
out the first Letterbox in Peru... go see Intipunko over at AQ . . . <br/>
the first finder gets a LBMA patch!<br/>
<br/>
ps  Bulldawg &amp; Koyote... did someone actually beat you guys to <br/>
Spirit or did you just not report the find? Congrats to Hikinghams <br/>
for the find at Spirit!</div>

<br/>
As for "SPIRIT".....I had offered the Hiking Hams" to meet up, and <br/>
they replied back to pic SAT or SUN, and never heard back, so I <br/>
guess they went alone.........kinda odd for no return email, but <br/>
hey.........whatever<br/>
<br/>
No worries..I hope to go there this weekend<br/>

pub crawl this week. Let me recover then I'll get right on it. P.I&gt; <br/>
set the gold standard. In the mean time... sign me up for the BBQ. <br/>
After two weeks of trekking &amp; exploring amazing Peru I'm back in my <br/>
beautiful Virginia. I'm pleased to have planted the first two <br/>
letterboxes in Peru. They are both in spectacular and secure <br/>
locations and I DO think they will be found soon.... maybe sooner <br/>
then some of my unfound boxes here in Virginia. Peru, with its <br/>
thousands of trails and incredible archeological sites, is a premier <br/>
destination for hikers... which we all know is a close cousin of <br/>
Letterboxing. The Hiking Expeditions Business is an important <br/>
industry in Peru. I met hundreds of hikers from all over the world. <br/>
So here is an open invitation to all my NoVa LB associates...  I've <br/>
many picture cd's and Peruvian music on cd... so if you want to come <br/>
over for a multimedia presentation of Gallant Rogue's Incan <br/>
Adventure... email, call or just come on down! I don't go back to <br/>
work till Wednesday and just busting to share my pictures. My dvd <br/>
player reads the jpeg files so I'm reviewing the pictures on my big <br/>
tv screen. I was at Machu Pichu for the solstice sunrise and <br/>
captured a photo of the first sun ray passing thru the temple <br/>
window... which happens just one time a year... I feel like Indiana <br/>
Jones!<br/>
