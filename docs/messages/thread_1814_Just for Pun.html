Two antennas met on a roof, fell in love and got married. The   ceremony wasn't much, but the reception was excellent.     2. A jumper cable walks into a bar. The bartender says, "I'll serve   you, but don't start Anything."     3. Two peanuts walk into a bar, and one was a salted.     4. A dyslexic man walks into a bra.     5. A man walks into a bar with a slab of asphalt under his arm and   says: "A beer please, and one for the road."      6. Two cannibals are eating a clown. One says to the other: "Does this   taste funny to you?"     7. "Doc, I can't stop singing 'The Green, Green Grass of Home.'"   "That sounds like Tom Jones Syndrome."   "Is it common?"   Well, "It's Not Unusual."     8. Two cows are standing next to each other in a field.. Daisy says to   Dolly, "I was artificially inseminated this morning." "I don't believe   you,"  says Dolly "It's true,
 no bull!" exclaims Daisy.     9. An invisible man marries an invisible woman. The kids were nothing   to look at either.     10. Deja Moo: The feeling that you've heard this bull before.     11. I went to buy some camouflage trousers the other day but I couldn't   find any.     12. A man woke up in a hospital after a serious accident. He shouted,    "Doctor, doctor, I can't feel my legs!" The doctor replied, "I know you   can't - I've cut off your arms!"     13. I went to a seafood disco last week... And pulled a mussel.     14.What do you call a fish with no eyes? A fsh.     15. Two fish swim into a concrete wall. The one turns to the other and   says "Dam!"     16. Two Eskimos sitting in a kayak were chilly, so they lit a fire in   the craft. Unsurprisingly it sank, proving once again that you can't   have yourkayak and heat it too.     17. A group of chess enthusiasts checked into a hotel and were standing   in the lobby discussing their recent tournament victories.
 After about   an hour,  the manager came out of the office and asked them to   disperse.  "But why," they asked, as they moved off.    "Because", he said, "I can't stand chess-nuts boasting in an open   foyer."     18. A woman has twins and gives them up for adoption. One of them goes   to a family in Egypt and is named "Ahmal." The other goes to a family   in Spain; they name him "Juan." Years later, Juan sends a picture of   himself to his birth mother. Upon receiving the picture, she tells her   husband that she wishes she also had a picture of Ahmal. Her husband   responds,  "They're twins! If you've seen Juan, you've seen Ahmal."     19. Mahatma Gandhi, as you know, walked barefoot most of the time,   which produced an impressive set of calluses on his feet. He also ate very   little, which made him rather frail and with his odd diet, he suffered   from bad breath. This made him ..(Oh, man, this is so bad, it's   good)..... A super calloused fragile mystic hexed by
 halitosis.     20. And finally, there was the person who sent twenty different puns to   his friends, with the hope that at least ten of the puns would make   them laugh.  No pun in ten did.  </tt></pre>  Â <p>
