that at least one person responded to the original post and I did not <br/>
get it. I have a feeling that the Bulk Mail Filter ate it. If you <br/>
responded before and did not get a reply from me... that is what <br/>
happened. Respond again, please!<br/>
<br/>
So pardon the second and revised posting: <br/>
<br/>
What I am doing is heading a project to put 49 boxes out in the <br/>
Girl Scout camps(properties) of this council (7 in each of the 7 <br/>
camps). This is through a class I am taking that requires a community <br/>
project. I figured why not combine 2 of my favorite communities - <br/>
LBing and GS! The boxes will only be available to GS that are in the <br/>
camps. They will not be on the LBNA or AtlasQuest site. This will be <br/>
a way of introducing this fun hobby to Scouts in a safe and familiar <br/>
environment. Think of them as Event stamps that will stay in place. <br/>
There will also be a tailored description of what letterboxing is all <br/>
about available to have them "taught right".<br/>
<br/>
  What is needed are stamps that are carved, boxes prepared, folks to <br/>
hide the boxes and write the clues, and a "this is letterboxing" <br/>
article written. This would be done by the end of August. Lastly I <br/>
want to have "experts" on call to teach and get girls excited about <br/>
Letterboxing at troop meetings or at the camps when they go on troop <br/>
camping trips. Do you see any way you could fill one of these roles? <br/>
<br/>
Do you have any stamps that you carved that you are not using? <br/>
Slightly flawed attempts, or retired boxes that you be willing to <br/>
donate to the cause? Or would you like to carve a few stamps to be <br/>
placed in the camps? Wanna spend a day out in a GS camp writing fun <br/>
clues and hiding boxes? Wanna compile a "how to" article? Or do you <br/>
want to do it all????? just kidding on that last one! <br/>
<br/>
  Really, I am just looking for support. I figure there are lots of <br/>
boxers out there that have retired stamps, slightly flawed ones or <br/>
just are willing to carve a few to have the girls learn about the <br/>
joys of LBing. Or would you be willing to be on an "on-call experts" <br/>
resource list to attend a GS troop meeting to get the girls excited <br/>
about LBing?<br/>
<br/>
LET ME KNOW by responding to this post... I will check here as well <br/>
