If it's possible (and legal), I plan to head into Easton tomorrow to<br/>
check on my Xak Promar series.  I think a few may be gone.  I then<br/>
plan to (again, if it's possible and legal) head down Rt. 611/32 into<br/>
Bucks County, take some pictures of the river, and seek out some boxes<br/>
in Point Pleasant.  <br/>
<br/>
Would anybody like me to check on your box while I'm traveling down<br/>
the river?  Let me know.<br/>
<br/>
The loss of a letterbox is insignificant compared to what the river<br/>
communities are going through, but somehow I feel called to do this<br/>
tomorrow...who knows...maybe I'll end up in the right place at the<br/>
right time to help somebody.<br/>

My concern goes out to all those affected by this latest one.  <br/>
Downtown Easton is under water again.<br/>
