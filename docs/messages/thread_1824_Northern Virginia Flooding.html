today, and the hike follows a stream most of the way.  It had risen to <br/>
a level in the past few days that had trashed the area, bringing the <br/>
water above all 3 of the foot bridges you cross.  The last foot bridge<br/>
(#43) is fairly large, and was taken down stream about 40 feet til it <br/>
lodged itself on some large trees.  You could still walk on it to get <br/>
across, but it was at an odd angle, and rocked depending on your <br/>
weight.  Me and the kids had fun cossing it, and took a few pictures <br/>
that i will post in the coming days of us on it.   Was cool, but still <br/>
the area was in shambles.</div>
