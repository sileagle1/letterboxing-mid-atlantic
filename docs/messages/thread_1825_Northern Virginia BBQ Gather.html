Depends on the response, and I have no idea if it's been done before.<br/>
<br/>
Out of nowhere, I had an idea to do a "BackYard BBQ Mini-Gather" for <br/>
the folks in the DC area.  Since me and Koyote are neighbors, (I'd <br/>
have to chat with him first)..we'd possibly have 2 grills, and enough <br/>
room for a few folks..nothing too large. We might even have to limit <br/>
the turnout....again, NO idea at all if Koyote would even want in.<br/>
<br/>
Imagining an end of summer event, with grilled food, refreshments, and <br/>
maybe a keg!.....There wouldn't be boxes at the event but many to do <br/>
before the cookout for those die-hards.  It'd be more a hangout, and <br/>
talk experience than a boxing experience.  Although there is a park <br/>
within walking didstance of the area, that we could plant some stuff <br/>
in.<br/>
<br/>
Again, not sure where this brainstorm came from, but I had a light-<br/>
bulb over my head, that can easily be put out, and very possible it <br/>
will.<br/>
<br/>
.....again, this idea is like 3 minutes old</div>

on and off the forums.....I think this will happen, but I think it <br/>
will have to be limited to a number of folks, mainly locals to build <br/>
some good local tightness..but not limited to just that.  But who is <br/>
really gonna drive far to a BBQ event that is 4-8 hours long anyway?<br/>
<br/>
Anyone else have ideas to a date?...suggestions?<br/>

kids are welcome.<br/>

dates to "vote" on.<br/>
