Placed 07/01/06<br/>
Ringwood, NJ, Passaic County <br/>
<br/>
Clues: Easy <br/>
Terrain: Difficult<br/>
Orientation: Difficult <br/>
Time: 2 - 3 hours <br/>
<br/>
Park at the end of Lake Riconda Drive, which is off of Stonetown <br/>
Road in Ringwood.<br/>
<br/>
Notes:<br/>
While the trails are blazed adequately, due to lack of use some of <br/>
the trails are not obvious.  This makes for difficult orientation <br/>
especially in the beginning.<br/>
This is a demanding series requiring multiple climbs.<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
At the end of Lake Riconda Road is a telephone pole that has two <br/>
blazes on it, the blue diamond Highlands Trail and the red triangle <br/>
Stonetown Circular.  Go to the left of the telephone pole picking up <br/>
the merged trail, which I'll simply refer to as the red trail.  Red <br/>
trail will shortly begin to climb Harrison Mountain.  You'll <br/>
eventually notice power line off to the right of the trail.  Soon <br/>
you'll come to a clearing that the power lines cross.  Pick up red <br/>
trail on the other side of the clearing.  After a brief decent <br/>
you'll do another much shorter climb.  You'll eventually come to a <br/>
tree that indicates to make a right for the Highlands Trail.  From <br/>
that blazed tree go 13 paces at 160 degrees.  There'll be a large <br/>
rock to the left, and a hole made by a fallen tree.  To the right of <br/>
the rock is a smaller rock, underneath it, in the front is another <br/>
rock and under that is what you seek.         <br/>

<br/>
Go back and take the right picking up the blue diamond Highland <br/>
Trail/ white blazed Horse Pond Mountain Trail, simply referred to as <br/>
the white trail.  White trail will begin to descend and then will <br/>
cross a small stream.  Shortly the trail will then take a left on to <br/>
a woods road.  White trail will begin to climb woods road and then <br/>
there will be blazes indicating to take the white trail off the <br/>
right of the woods road.  White trail will begin climbing.  You'll <br/>
eventually come to a clearing, continue on white trail.  White trail <br/>
will pass the start of the yellow blazed Burnt Meadow Trail.  Stay <br/>
on white trail and you'll shortly come to a viewpoint.  Enjoy the <br/>
view and when done locate the campfire near the middle of the <br/>
trail.  From campfire go 14 paces at 320 degrees to a rock outcrop.  <br/>
Underneath it, under another rock is what you seek.<br/>
