A couple of boxes (posted on the German letterboxing site) are nearby <br/>

Hope you have a wonderful time.  I head back up to scout camp today, <br/>
bringing carving stuff.  I postponed out DWG marathon, as they are <br/>
calling for strong storms from midday on.<br/>

Can Kobayashi repeat again??  I sense a fun letterbox stamp in that one.<br/>

up due to the intermittent rain, and found seven really neat drivebys<br/>

a good location for it.  Mission accomplished. <br/>
<br/>
It felt good to be out since I have been in a self imposed<br/>
letterboxing exile due to the fact that I am not crazy about ticks,<br/>
mosquitoes, poison ivy, gnats, black flies, heat, humidity, etc. Maybe<br/>
this weekend will bring more than drivebys my way.<br/>

<br/>
</span></blockquote>I didn't bring any Exacto blades. I separated the Lino blades from the <br/>
Speedball handles so that they were quite small and explainable. <br/>
<br/>
Funny story: a seam in my slacks came undone so I got out my travel <br/>
sewing kit to repair it, and I remembered that all the pins and needles <br/>
were missing: after 9/11 I was stopped on a flight and security (this <br/>
was before Homeland Security) took away all the pins and needles, as if <br/>
I could take over a plane by irritating somebody to death. Come to <br/>
think of it, I've sat next to those people on several flights...<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Carving on the plane?!?<br/>
<br/>
</span></blockquote>Snakes On A Plane??!! Nobody really asked me about the carving, and it <br/>
was a challenge to keep track of the nubs. Although the flight was <br/>
bumpy, the worst part was getting my elbo bumped by a passing flight <br/>
attendant just as I was finishing a cut. <br/>

Sorry about Red Heron - we came along soon after some goober broke it <br/>
into 3 pieces, was an excellent stamp.  <br/>
<br/>
That section of Bellevue is creepy, where the trail goes behind the <br/>
junk yards and toward 495 and it's hard to know that it's still part of <br/>
a state park.<br/>

Syner and I were house-hunting and box-hunting.  The heat/humidity on <br/>
Monday were just insane.<br/>
