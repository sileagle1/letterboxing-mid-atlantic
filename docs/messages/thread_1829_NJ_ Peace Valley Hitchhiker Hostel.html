Peace Valley Hitchhiker Hostel <br/>
Montville, NJ, Morris County <br/>
Placed by Wingfoot on 07/2/06 <br/>

Terrain: Gravel Road <br/>
<br/>
Please only take a hitchhiker if you are leaving one. <br/>
<br/>
NOTES: <br/>
This is a different sort of letterbox; it may not be for everyone. <br/>
First, it's a hitchhiker hostel, so it should always contain a <br/>
hitchhiker in addition to the Peace Valley stamp. Second, it's a <br/>
drive up location, so you are stopping to stamp into this box along <br/>
a gravel road. This road is almost never used, but it is used <br/>
nonetheless. So some caution is advised. You may want to have a map <br/>
or something handy to make it look like you stopped to check it if <br/>
somebody does happen to come along. Third, the direction I'm giving <br/>
are for folks coming in from Pine Brook Road going north, they won't <br/>
work if you come in the opposite direction. And fourth, this is a <br/>
road rally box in that the clues you'll be following you will do <br/>
while driving, so it's recommended to have a driver and passenger <br/>
that is looking out for the clue locations. Additionally and <br/>
unfortunately some illegal dumping has taken place along the road. <br/>
<br/>
Please only take a hitchhiker if you are leaving one. <br/>
<br/>
To get to this location you'll come in on Pine Brook Road in <br/>
Montville heading north. When you come to Peace Valley Road on the <br/>
right take it. There are several houses at the beginning of this <br/>
road. When the houses end, so will the pavement, as this road now <br/>
becomes a gravel road. <br/>
<br/>
You'll notice to the right Great Piece Meadows. This is a great <br/>
floodplain that has been recently acquired by the Army Corps of <br/>
Engineers so that it always stays in its natural state. Great Piece <br/>
Meadows comprises some 4000 acres. There are no marked hiking trails <br/>
here that I know of. There are coyotes living here and recently a <br/>
bear has been spotted in the area. Supposedly a bigfoot family was <br/>
sited in this area as well. You can read about that here: <br/>

<br/>
The planter of this letterbox had neither seen nor reported <br/>
bigfoots. Or would it be bigfeet? <br/>
<br/>
Continuing along the gravel road you'll eventually come to two <br/>
glacial erratics right next to each other along the right side of <br/>
the road. A short distance down the road one the right is an even <br/>
larger glacial erratic. Continuing down the gravel road eventually <br/>
you'll come to three glacial erratics along the left side of the <br/>
gravel road. Behind the middle one, underneath a rock is what you <br/>
seek. <br/>
<br/>
Please only take a hitchhiker if you are leaving one. <br/>
<br/>
After stamping in please rehide box where you found it, completely <br/>
hidden from view. <br/>
<br/>
The road continues on so you don't have to turn around to get out.</div>
