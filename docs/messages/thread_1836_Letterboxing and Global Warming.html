And despite a comprehensive plan of denial and neglect by the current administration, global <br/>
warming seems to be killing polar bears pretty efficiently in the Arctic.<br/>
<br/>
What does this mean to Letterboxers?  I don't know.  Maybe it's the new Y2K.  Or maybe we <br/>
will start seeing more and more flooding - particularly here in the East where we seem to be <br/>
paving over all of the land that used to absorb much of the run-off that's flooding our <br/>
neighborhoods and parks.<br/>
<br/>
My 2 cents is, if you like your boxes to stick around for a while, you might want to rethink <br/>
planting them in locations so close to water.  As so many of our parks are near creeks and <br/>
rivers that becomes a challenge.<br/>
<br/>
Thoughts?<br/>
