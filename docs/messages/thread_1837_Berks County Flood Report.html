awaiting the weekend to go boxing in Berks County, PA, so I thought I<br/>
would give a little update based on my box checking this week.  First<br/>
of all, Nolde Forest with its zillion boxes is in good shape.  The<br/>
streams there are much higher than normal for this time of the year<br/>
but I found both of my boxes there safe and sound.  From what I can<br/>
remember about the location of many of the other ones, they should<br/>
also be safe.  There is one mystery box that I am doubtful about<br/>
though.  So come to Berks county and head for Nolde.<br/>
<br/>
I also went to Blue Marsh to check on my boxes there this afternoon<br/>
but was not surprised to find that the park is still closed entirely.<br/>
 I was able to slip in to check on Silent Doug's Capitol Tile:<br/>
Cardinal and it appears to be gone.  I was amazed to see that the<br/>
water line was way past this box which is a good forty feet away from<br/>
the lake itself.<br/>
<br/>
The Exeter River Trail is also closed.  Both Silent Doug and I have a<br/>
box on that trail and I will check on them as soon as the trail<br/>
re-opens.  This trail was waaaaaayyyyyyy under water so I don't expect<br/>
to find my box there anymore.  Doug's was much higher and may have<br/>
survived.<br/>
<br/>
So if you are coming to my neck of the woods, avoid Blue Marsh and<br/>
head for Nolde or French Creek.  I haven't been to French Creek but I<br/>
haven't heard any local rumblings about any kind of trouble there.<br/>
