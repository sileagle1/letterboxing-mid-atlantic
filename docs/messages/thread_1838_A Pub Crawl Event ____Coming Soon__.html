We are not ready to release specific details because we are working <br/>
out details and want to provide some surprises...  but looking at <br/>
the LBMA Calendar and vacation schedules for local letterboxers we <br/>
are counting on to attend... Saturday NOVEMBER 11th is the date we <br/>
are looking at.  This is a three day weekend for govt. employees<br/>
<br/>
There is no way we could duplicate the Magnificent Ivy's Magical <br/>
Leesburg Pub Crawl so we will not try to imitate rather we will <br/>
borrow some of his great ideas. and add some ideas from some other <br/>
successful events and add a new idea or two and produce a new and <br/>
different product that will uphold the high standards of LBMA.<br/>
<br/>
Why November? There is simply too much to do to hold it in July... <br/>
too many vacations to compete with in August... Knoebels II is in <br/>
September, "It's Just a Game" is in October... so The Old Town Pub <br/>
Crawl Event (name to be announced later!) will be the weekend after <br/>
Halloween... while the weather is still reasonably good... and on a <br/>
Full Moon Weekend...<br/>
<br/>
This will allow our letterboxing associates from around the country <br/>
to make their travel arrangements! <br/>
<br/>
 We will release the event name August 1st !</div>

A quick phone call with GR this evening and it was clarified that with <br/>
the moon full (well 99%) on Sat Nov 4 folks will have a better chance <br/>
of finding their way to the next pub!  <br/>
<br/>
So mark your calendars for SAT NOV 4.<br/>
<br/>
As soon as some details are finalized and the event name is selected <br/>
GR will create an AQ Event for sign up.<br/>
