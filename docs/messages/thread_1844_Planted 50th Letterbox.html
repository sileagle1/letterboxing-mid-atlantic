<br/>
I just planted a new letterbox, my 50th.  It's in New york, but it's <br/>
just over the New Jersey border, so I wanted to post it to this list <br/>
as well.  This was my first box in the state, but it was also the <br/>
1st one I planted getting permission.  The park is geocaching <br/>
friendly,  however I had to educate them on letterboxing,  it was <br/>
quite a learning experience for both the Park Manager and myself.  <br/>
This is really a fantastic park, almost 20,000 acres &amp; I think it's <br/>
the 1st letterbox planted there.  Enjoy!<br/>

Clues<br/>
Approaching the Visitor's Center from parking across road go left <br/>
picking up blue trail, which you'll be staying on the entire hike.  <br/>
Trail shortly crosses small bridge giving you your first good look <br/>
at Sterling Lake.  Trail will shortly meets up with road.   Take <br/>
right following blazes.  You'll notice Sterling Furnace off left of <br/>
road.  Sterling Furnace was built in 1751.  Continue following <br/>
blazes along road, eventually blazes will lead you down woods road.  <br/>
Yellow trail meets up with blue trail.  Take right along merged <br/>
blue/yellow trail.  Trail will go up a gradual climb and then <br/>
descend.  Trail will then go up a second incline and begin <br/>
descending.  During the descent there will be a tree on the right of <br/>
trail with blazes indicating to go right.  From tree with blazes <br/>
cross road at a bearing of 20 degrees to another tree.  Behind the <br/>
tree, under a couple of rocks is what you seek.  There should be a <br/>
tree off to your right with a faded blue blaze.  If you come to the <br/>
beach, you've gone to far.  You'll need to backtrack just a short <br/>
ways to locate the letterbox.    <br/>
<br/>
After stamping in please rehide box where you found it, completely <br/>
hidden from view.<br/>
<br/>
From here you can continue along the blue trail back to the <br/>
Visitor's Center, however it is a bit hillier then the way you <br/>
came.</div>
