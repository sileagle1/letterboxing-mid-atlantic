                    <div id="ygrps-yiv-1714199758">If it's a clean break, maybe you can turn it into a hinged stamp. Place the<br/>
two pieces together firmly and place tape on the back, then cut off the<br/>
excess tape around the edges.  I've only done it the other way, placed the<br/>
intact stamp on tape and then cut almost all the way through the stamp so<br/>
it can be folded over. I use 3-4 layers of clear packing tape. Some people<br/>
use duct tape. When it's cut cleanly you don't see any line at all in the<br/>
stamped image. It might work,depending on the break. <br/>
Good luck. <br/>
