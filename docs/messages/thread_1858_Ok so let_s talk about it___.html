                    <div id="ygrps-yiv-12007688"><div>Here's my dilemma over the CN8 thing. This is the third contact attempt in a year or so. The first was to this list, the second two I got direct to me via LBNA from my Tyler boxes. I am sure I am not the only one. Print media in local newspapers doesn't scare me as I really think most folks don't read newpapers anymore, or most knuckleheads anyway. The Games thing I agreed to because the gal contacted me directly and said she would abide by any rules I laid out. My rules were 1. no park names 2. no box names 3. Dude's name must be mentioned (I figured, what the hell) 4. No long list of sites and references as to how to get into the hobby. If they're puzzlers, they can puzzle it out. Amazingly she agreed to everything. Showed up at Campin' and Stampin' and went out with us. Miz Scarlet carved her a "Lois Lane" stamp and she still uses that ID when she emails me. She did ask to make one change afterward. Her editor wanted her
 to at least include the dot org address at the end of the article. He said when he googled the hobby it's the first thing that came up anyway, so I said okay.</div> <div> </div> <div>The CN8 thing scares me as more since 1. More knuckleheads do watch TV than read the paper so our risk is greater 2. For some reason I just think TV reporters can't be trusted (probably from watching too many TV shows - I include myself in the knucklehead group) 3. No one, including me, wants to see my a$$ on TV!! </div> <div>But if we just ignore them, will they go away? Or will they go ahead anyway and we lose any opportunity we may have had to control the process as I did with Lois Lane and Games?</div> <div> </div> <div>Lastly, yes I am not a fan of media attention but have participated now in 3 interviews in very small publications read by a small audience. Before you flame me keep in mind - If that first brave soul hadn't agreed to do the interview for
 Smithsonian none of us would be enjoying this hobby now. If Brian of TGD and the others hadn't done Time magazine we would have never gotton Choi who has been a huge help to the LBNA site. He put in all those fancy bells and whistles that lot's of folks like (not me though). But I know some folks who really enjoy tracking thier attempts and finds. That's all thanks to him.</div> <div> </div> <div>So is this like the immigration thing "My and my ancestors got in but no more! We're out of room", or do we pick our battles and try to control the process.</div> <div> </div> <div>I tell ya, CN8 is probably not going away. Thoughts?</div> <div> </div> <div>H&amp;H </div><p>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;    <br/>

</span></blockquote>I disagree.  I think the immigration thing, like all of this administrations initiatives, have <br/>
nothing to do with the actual issue, but is mainly an attempt to distract us from the fact <br/>
that a horribly unpopular president got us into a totally unnecessary war.<br/>
<br/>
It's like this: America says, "We have 45 million Americans with no access to healthcare."<br/>
The Administration says, "We can't have Gay marriage in this country!"<br/>
<br/>
America says, "We are worried about Social Security drying up and corporations stealing <br/>
our pensions."<br/>
The Administration says, "We need a Flag burning Amendment!"  [When was the last time <br/>
you saw a flag being burned in the US?  197-?]<br/>
<br/>
America says, "This is the wrong war and you lied to get us into it.  We're taking back the <br/>
House and the Senate."<br/>
The Administration says, "Oh my God  There are 11 million illegal aliens in this country!  I <br/>
was once governor of Texas, but I had no idea it was this bad!"<br/>
<br/>
About the other thing...  Use your best judgement.<br/>

PS- I'm all for the CN8 thing if you can do it before Fall.</div>
