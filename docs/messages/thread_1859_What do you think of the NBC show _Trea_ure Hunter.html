I was intrigued at how out of shape everyone seems to be (especially<br/>
that whiny 20-something blonde daughter), but realized that the<br/>
editors probably cut out the miles and miles they're trekking.<br/>

Even though it *could* be right up my alley, the episodes I watched<br/>

gonna aim for Leesburg, make ya search out clues etc...to find a box <br/>
with your team.  So if ya start off with 6 teams, box #1..would have 5 <br/>
