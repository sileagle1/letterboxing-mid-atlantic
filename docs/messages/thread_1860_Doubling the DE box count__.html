Back home from DE and another week plotting plants all over Sussex and <br/>
Kent counties.  Now must get down to the business of writing crafty <br/>
clues to keep all on their toes.  Tried to include some Trail <br/>
Challenge hikes, the 97 degree heat was tolerable but the flys (not <br/>
skeeters) were unbearable.  I did get in total of 5 miles in several <br/>
parks and between sessions with the car A/C.  That was after the 7.5 <br/>
mile hike around Lums Pond (New Castle county) with Sheba and <br/>
GeckoSpot last Thur.  Mother Duck and her brood came over to meet us <br/>
at Lums Pond, so more exchanges!<br/>
