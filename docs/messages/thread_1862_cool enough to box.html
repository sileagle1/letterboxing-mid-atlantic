Neutragena has this new sunscreen that goes on in a COLD spray! I haven't<br/>
looked for it yet but that would feel great on a hot and humid day. <br/>

box two weeks ago!!!!!!!!!<br/>
<br/>
Actaully, none of us were wearing any bug repellant at the time <br/>
because we were walking along the river but not in the woods.  <br/>
Mayhaps those flies really do like the taste of DEET?<br/>
<br/>
As for the sunscreen/bug repellant combo, we use Bug And Sun when we <br/>
got to the beach.  Haven't been bitten by anything while wearing it. <br/>
But then, like I say, we didn't wear it in New Castle (-:<br/>
