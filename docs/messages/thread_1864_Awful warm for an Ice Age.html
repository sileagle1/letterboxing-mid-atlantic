<br/>
Last Thursday I left before the crack of dawn and headed up to Mt. <br/>
Haycock, not really a mountain, but close enough for Bucks County. <br/>
Divine Lotus' Ice Age series has had me chomping at the bit ever since I <br/>
saw them in Myke's logbook a while back.<br/>
<br/>
So I get there at about 6, put on the recommended bug spay, a good thing <br/>
too, since the woods are thick with mesquites this year, and headed up <br/>
the mountain.<br/>
<br/>
I found the first three with no trouble, all in excellent condition.  I <br/>
could not find the next two, I just could not spot the landmarks, and <br/>
then the fun really began.<br/>
<br/>
The path kinda disappears, and you are left knowing that you need to get <br/>
to the top of this giant pile of rock, but not knowing just how to do <br/>
this.  Add to the the already oppressive head and humidity, a hallmark <br/>
of Pennsylvania Julys, and you are in for a tough go at it.<br/>
<br/>
But, I was prepared, I had plenty of water (hiker's rule #1, 2, and 3, <br/>
bring water), and slowly clambered up the rocks.  I got to the top, <br/>
found I was about a hundred yards from where I needed to be, but from <br/>
there I found the last two boxes with ease.<br/>
<br/>
More sweating, grunting, sliding on rocks that I was trying to climb <br/>
down found be back at the bottom in pretty short order.  I was drenched <br/>
in sweat, covered in dirt, sure that I had rolled in poison ivy more <br/>
then once, but elated at my finds, and looking forward to returning to <br/>
find the rest as well as other boxes that may be hiding on that there <br/>
mountain.<br/>
<br/>
Today I will update my logbook so you can see these wonderful stamps, if <br/>
you wish.<br/>

dirty people crawling out of the woods. Do they look at each other and lock<br/>
the car doors? lol! When I'm inside those kinds of woods that are<br/>
surrounded by trees, not one wisp of air moving, I have sweat pouring off<br/>
me and I turn beet red. I have a feeling I look like someone who just<br/>
buried a body. hah! The bugspray won't stay on my face because of the sweat<br/>
and since they can't get in anywhere else they go for the head. Last week I<br/>
had two bites in my eyebrow. lol And........I can't count the times I've<br/>
gotten on the subway with dirt under my nails from digging around with<br/>
urban boxes....the equivalant of emerging out of the woods. <br/>

Glad to see you enjoyed our boxes!!! Leafcutters has quite a few WOM in <br/>
the general vicinity, so you will have to make a return trip! Sorry you <br/>
were stumped by 2 boxes, Myke only missed the most EVIL one!! It is <br/>
hidden in a little cave, just for Irene! <br/>
