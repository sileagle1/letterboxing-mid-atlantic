<div><font face="Courier" size="2">Fortunately Richmond, RI is findable with 
service. Dave and I were hiking in search of a couple boxes in that part of 
Arcadia Park last November and the daylight disappeared. You can imagine how 
hard it is to see blue blazes on trees in the gloom of on-coming evening.  
Especially when they alternate with yellow. We knew enough to stop when we felt 
we had left the trail and called 911. The cell phone not only found a signal, 
but they were able to locate us by the GPS thingy in the phone.  While the 
State Park does not have rangers on duty (in November on a weekend after 
4PM) they did tell us which way to hike to get out of the woods. 
Fortunately, there was only a small stream to ford on the walk out. So with wet 
feet and wounded pride we found the forest road and the lot we parked our car 
in! Said thanks to the State Trooper who met us at the car and went home to rest 
our weary bones. </font></div>
<div><font face="Courier" size="2">While we were prepared to spend the night in the 
woods - so glad we didn't have to. We now have one of those wind-up flashlights 
in the backpack. That way I don't have to worry about "when was the last time 
you checked the batteries?"!</font></div>
<div><font face="Courier" size="2">We went back the next day to finish the series 
and found the spot where we had stopped(I took a photograph with my digital 
camera). Turns out we hadn't left the trail afterall and we were within 3 feet 
of a blazed tree!</font></div>
<div><font face="Courier" size="2">We had totally under-estimated how long it would 
take to hike the given mileage, not to mention the stops at the boxes for 
stamping in and admiring the stamps/boxes and surroundings.. That's why I really 
like it when planters give you an idea of how long it should take to do their 
hike.</font></div>

to it from my checking account)and I am amazed at the locations where<br/>
I can't pick up service (on the turnpike between Morgantown and<br/>
Downingtown) and at the places that I can pick it up (lost on the top<br/>
of a high spot in French Creek).  In fact, the French Creek reception<br/>
was really weird, I could call out while I was lost and bushwacking<br/>
but as soon as I got back on the trail, I lost service.  If I didn't<br/>
like so many of the other advantages I get with Verizon, I would<br/>
consider trading.<br/>

                    <div id="ygrps-yiv-329116299">Boy does this bring back bad memories from last summer! Sheba and I were hunting a mapsurfer box in a very remote area. the woods were very deep and no one else was there. No cell signal, no path eve. Just blazed trees. The blazes are old and faded and many of the trees had been knocked down by a hurricance. We were about halfway to the box when I really got concerned about losing the light and getting stuck in the woods for the night. the blazes were hard enough to find in full sun and would have been impossible to find in the dark. I had taken a compass bearing of where the car was so we could have nushwacked our way out, maybe. Anyway, we decided to bail and come back another day. I'm really glad we did. But you bring up a good point.  Dude and I have gotten stuck in the woods at least 3 times after dark. Fortunately they were woods I knew pretty well and I am always prepared to spend the night. But my experience is that leterboxing always takes me a lot longer than
 I originally estimated.<br/><br/><b><i>dave &amp; diane &lt;vonderinsel@...&gt;</i></b> wrote:  <blockquote><span title="qreply"> <blockquote class="ygrps-yiv-329116299replbq" style="PADDING-LEFT:5px;MARGIN-LEFT:5px;BORDER-LEFT:#1010ff 2px solid;"> <div id="ygrps-yiv-329116299ygrp-text"> <div> <div><font face="Courier" size="2"></font></div> <div><font face="Courier" size="2">We had totally under-estimated how long it would take to hike the given mileage, </font></div> <div><font face="Courier" size="2">Diane</font></div> <div><font size="2"><font face="Courier">the von der Insels<span style="COLOR:white;"></span></font></font> </div></div></div> <div style="CLEAR:both;FONT-SIZE:1px;COLOR:#fff;">.</div><img height="1" src="http://geo.yahoo.com/serv?s=97359714&amp;grpId=12213842&amp;grpspId=1600065786&amp;msgId=9139&amp;stime=1153451803" width="1"/> <br/><span style="COLOR:white;"></span> </blockquote><br/><p>

<p>Boy does this bring back bad memories from last summer! Sheba and I were 
  hunting a mapsurfer box in a very remote area. the woods were very deep and no 
  one else was there. No cell signal, no path eve. Just blazed trees. The blazes 
  are old and faded and many of the trees had been knocked down by a hurricance. 
  We were about halfway to the box when I really got concerned about losing the 
  light and getting stuck in the woods for the night. the blazes were hard 
  enough to find in full sun and would have been impossible to find in the dark. 
  I had taken a compass bearing of where the car was so we could have nushwacked 
  our way out, maybe. Anyway, we decided to bail and come back another day. I'm 
  really glad we did. But you bring up a good point.  Dude and I have 
  gotten stuck in the woods at least 3 times after dark. Fortunately they were 
  woods I knew pretty well and I am always prepared to spend the night. But my 
  experience is that leterboxing always takes me a lot longer than I originally 
  estimated.<br/><br/><b><i>dave &amp; diane &lt;vonderinsel@...&gt;</i></b>

I have Cingular, and for years at summer camp, I have had ZERO <br/>
(Zilch, None, Not any, goose-egg) signal.<br/>
<br/>
This year, I actually got 1 wavering bar--too weak to make a call <br/>
on, but--surprise, surprise--enough to send and receive short text <br/>
messages.<br/>
<br/>
With massive storms moving through the area (last week of June), it <br/>
was a welcome "advancement" to get short weather blips from home.<br/>
<br/>
Now, I'll stay with Cingular.<br/>

Thanks,<br/>
