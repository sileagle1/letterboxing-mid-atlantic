the boxes in Kinder Farm Park, "Kinder Park Treasure" and "Kinder Farm Park." Both were <br/>
vandallized when we found them. A lid was all that remained of one of them, while the other <br/>
had an intact container with two empty baggies inside. <br/>
<br/>
While the lid-only box was in a fairly high-trafficked area, and showed signs of partying <br/>
nearby (beer cans, etc.), the intact-but-empty box had been hidden in a very non-obvious <br/>
spot that one really would have needed the clues to access.<br/>
<br/>
Sad stuff. There is also a fairly new box in the area, which was in fine shape; our guess is the <br/>
vandalism happened before it was planted.<br/>
