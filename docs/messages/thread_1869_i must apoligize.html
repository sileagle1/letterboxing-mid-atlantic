                    <div id="ygrps-yiv-2103201027">it has come to my attention that i may have said some things that <br/>
may have been taken the wrong way. let me begin.<br/>
<br/>
first, let me say that Pennsylvania is a wonderful state. i look <br/>
forward to visiting/invading PA. some of you may have taken some of <br/>
the things i have said about your state to heart. i never meant for <br/>
this to happen. this whole invasion thing that i have been planning, <br/>
is a game i hope goes over real well. i only have been saying some <br/>
of these things to kinda get some people to notice and have fun with <br/>
it. i have visited your state 2 times in the past and have never had <br/>
a better time then in the keystone state. your state if full of <br/>
history and that might be why i love PA the most. this time around, <br/>
i had hoped to meet some of you LBers while there. so far i have met <br/>
hikers n' hounds and i have no doubts that the rest of you are any <br/>
less kinder than they are. i was lucky enough to have met with irene <br/>
on more than 1 occation, and look forward to meeting her and all of <br/>
you, on your turf.<br/>
<br/>
second, have always been pretty good about croo-posting. i don't <br/>
think it has every really been a problem with me until resently. <br/>
with this invasion game coming up, i just want to make sure that <br/>
everyone that can play, knows about it. after i head to PA, there <br/>
will be maybe 1 more cross-post. this will state a winner.<br/>
<br/>
a winner? i guess now would be a good time to explain this invasion <br/>
game that i have planned. when i had planned on invadaing PA, it had <br/>
nothing to do with aliens. after awhile, it sounded like a cool <br/>
thing to do. then i got into it a bit more and it was on.<br/>
<br/>
here is the deal:<br/>
--the invasion starts on august 12th of 06'. destination french <br/>
creek state park in beautiful pennsylvania. i will be LBing in NH, <br/>
MA, CT, NY, NJ, DE, MD, VA, PA, on that day, collecting at least 1 <br/>
box in every state. boxes and est time range will be posted saturday <br/>
and listed for the 2 weeks heading up to the invasion.<br/>
--finding us should be rather easy. be at the location in the time <br/>
range posted, and look for me and 2 little aliens running around <br/>
looking for a letterbox. we WILL try to look as normal as possible. <br/>
do not be afraid to walk up to us and try and stop the invasion. our <br/>
spaceship has already been posted on <br/>
<a href="http://thealieninvasion.blogspot.com" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://thealieninvasion.blogspot.com</a> already so you can look for us <br/>
before getting out of the car to look for us.<br/>
--now don't think you won't get anything out of this. the person who <br/>
stops us from invading PA will, and i really mean will, get a prize. <br/>
i made something specially for this invasion and i want to reward <br/>
the person who figures out how to stop us. i just not going to say <br/>
right now how to do it. you'll have to wait and see.<br/>
<br/>
so i don't know if i have left anything out. feel free to ask me any <br/>
questions about this game/invasion. i will do my best to give the <br/>
the answer your looking for. hopefully this invasion thing goes over <br/>
awesome. if so, i plan on invading somewhere else next year.<br/>
<br/>
let the good times roll in the granite state.<br/>

offend me, but rather amused me.  I often have fun tweaking (perhaps <br/>
contrived) hubris and did so several times.  We welcome your invasion <br/>
and hope that some alien artifacts are left behind, preferable <br/>
outside the route 202 barrier!  We all pick on each other, but have <br/>
been giving H+H major slack lately.<br/>
<br/>
Perhaps a pass through the greater Lehigh Valley on the way to or fro <br/>
would be appropriate.  If you did pass though, you could lord it over <br/>
H+H, as she is apparently afraid of coming up here despite <br/>
reassurances from her downstate brethren that we are all not inbred <br/>
rednecks that mean her bodily harm!<br/>
<br/>
As for myself, I intend to be in French Creek on the 13th.  I'll be <br/>
Orienteering in French Creek with the kiddo and maybe the reps from <br/>
the lower three counties that morning and hope to meet up with the <br/>
alien invasionary force sometime.  Email off line if you want o <br/>
arrange something and trade cell numbers.<br/>

If PA reclaimed the Lower Three, yes, we'd get the beaches and the<br/>
Blue Rocks.  But then the Lower Three would be subject to OUR laws,<br/>
and hence get state stores and sales tax.<br/>

So perhaps the better solution would be if Delaware would annex the<br/>
Upper Sixty-Seven.<br/>
