Is all I can say about todays gathering.  <br/>
<br/>
Irene the park was a great spot to hold the event.  The T-shirts are<br/>
awesome.  Thanks so much again for having this arranged and done. <br/>
They look supurb and I can't wait to wear mine out letterboxing<br/>
tomorrow.  <br/>
<br/>
There were lots of people there.  It was GREAT meeting everyone and<br/>
seeing some familiar faces again, too.  Thanks to everyone who stamped<br/>
in my log book.  There were some people that I missed getting their<br/>
stamps, but maybe some day.<br/>
<br/>
Hope everyone had a good time, I know I did.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Thanks  :)<br/>

(Hikers &amp; Hounds) made up a bunch of shirts awhile back and then put <br/>
together this gathering so that people could pick their shirts up <br/>
(and box, meet people, etc.). <br/>
<br/>
I agree with Bev - it was a lot of fun! :) Thanks to Irene for all of <br/>
her hard work!!!<br/>

If you are ever flying through the Philly airport, be sure to email <br/>
me with your info. I have a special traveler stamp for anyone who <br/>
catches me in uniform at an airport or better yet, on an airplane. <br/>
<br/>
The folks at USAirways know me as "Amanda from Seattle" too! So you <br/>
can always ask for me on your flight! Who knows...I might be hiding <br/>
in the back galley! :-)<br/>

Hamburg, PA today. These were originally planted in 98-99 by Marty, making <br/>
them some of the earliest letterboxes planted in the US, but had fallen <br/>
into disrepair in recent years. Now that they've been adopted, the boxes <br/>
have new logs and stamps, and the clues have been verified (and adjusted as <br/>
necessary). You can find the clues on the LbNA site or at:<br/>
<a href="http://www.letterboxing.info/silentdoug/planted.php" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.letterboxing.info/silentdoug/planted.php</a><br/>
<br/>
It's a 9-mile round trip along the Appalachian Trail to get both boxes, but <br/>
you'll be rewarded with spectacular views and two letterboxes!<br/>

</span></blockquote>cahillymom - you were wise not to stop for the Tinicum boxes.  Judy <br/>
and I stopped for them, in spite of the art show.  We followed the <br/>
clues to the first box carefully, found the landmark tree on the tow <br/>
path, took the compass reading to find THE TREE and then spent about <br/>
an hour poking around every darn tree, upright and down, in the disc <br/>
golf course.  Nada.  So we headed in the other direction to find the <br/>
other box.  We found the creek and bridge and then got stuck.  The <br/>
clues say go down to the creek bed and follow it.  The creek bed may <br/>
have been dry when the clues were first posted but you can't get down <br/>
there now.  So we tried to follow the creek. WHICH DIRECTION!!?? No <br/>
clue.  AARGH.  We first chose the easiest direction which took us <br/>
through people's backyards - not in wooded backyards either, we were <br/>
on their lawn! This was way too conspicuous so we went back to the <br/>
bridge.  We thought we'd try in the other direction but we couldn't <br/>
even follow the creek in that direction because of the evil looking <br/>
underbrush and me, wearing shorts, did not want to rip her legs to <br/>
shreds.  We cursed H&amp;H and tramped a mile or more back to the car <br/>
with nothing to show for it.  We were tired and cranky and had to <br/>
stop for ice cream.  That helped.  :)<br/>
<br/>
So, Hikers and Hounds - Have you ever received any confirmation that <br/>
these boxes have been found?  And you might want to amend the clues <br/>
as to the second box - WHICH WAY DO YOU FOLLOW THE CREEK?  Do we <br/>
really need to walk in backyards?  Or is it in the other, <br/>
inaccessible direction?  <br/>
<br/>
I had a great time this weekend.  Thanks, Irene, for everything.<br/>

although Thomas is probably not ready for it yet.  Give him a coupl <br/>
eof years.  I know a couple of side trails that can get you up in <br/>
less distance, cutting the RT to about 6-7 miles. The vertical <br/>
steepness is about the same, you just cut off some distance along the <br/>
ridge on the AT. The shortcut goes along a nice hemlock lined stream <br/>
that feels almost air conditioned on hot humid days.<br/>
<br/>
I'd certainly like to head back out to the Hamburg Reservoir someday,<br/>
as Allentown is only about 45 minutes from the trailhead.<br/>
<br/>
Next weekend is tied up (Wine Festival in the Finger Lakes July<br/>
16-19 and hopefully being allowed by Mrs. Lightnin' Bug to hunt a few<br/>
boxes), but the following Saturday (July 24) may be worthwhile.<br/>

                    <div id="ygrps-yiv-1467614006">A couple of extra notes on the Pinnacle and Pulpit Rock letterboxes:<br/>
<br/>
I carved the Pinnacle stamp on the spot -- I wasn't sure that it was <br/>
missing, all I knew was that the box was completely water logged. I brought <br/>
along everything to restore it (a new box, baggies, log book, a piece of <br/>
speedy stamp and my carving knife), so I took a couple of minutes to make a <br/>
new stamp for it. If you have the image on the clue page (which is the <br/>
original), you can compare my handiwork and grade the results!<br/>
<br/>
On your way up the mountain, pick up a rock and carry it to the top. You'll <br/>
know what to do with it when you reach the Pinnacle! (PA is known for <br/>
having some of the rockiest sections of the Appalachian Trail....)<br/>
<br/>
 From mid-June until mid-August, you'll probably run into Appalachian Trail <br/>
thru-hikers on this stretch of trail. This is when they'll be passing <br/>
through the area on the 2,174 mile trek from Springer Mountain in Georgia <br/>
to Mt. Katahdin in Maine. If you want to see some happy faces, take along <br/>
some extra cold sodas, fresh fruit or other goodies and offer them to any <br/>
thru-hikers you pass by on the trail (or, if you're like me, it's more <br/>
likely that they'll be passing by you even with their 40-lb backpacks!). <br/>
There are lots of places along the AT where trail angels traditionally <br/>
visit to pass out treats to the committed hikers, and you can be part of <br/>
the tradition too. Just ask any dirty, sweaty, tired looking backpackers if <br/>
they're thru-hiking and, if so, offer up a cold drink -- and see how <br/>
appreciative they are for your generosity!<br/>
<br/>
Finally, don't miss the secret passage at the Pinnacle. Any letterboxer <br/>
ought to be able to find it -- and a flashlight just might come in handy.<br/>

least the remnants of the box) were there, but it was in the right place <br/>
according to the clue.<br/>

I am really sorry i missed the gathering.<br/>
I really wanted to come.<br/>
My class was not that great.  One family (4 kids, one mom and one <br/>
grandma) came.  They found one box and made stamps.<br/>
I just couldn't get away afterwards since I was scheduled to leave <br/>
on a business trip at noon the next day.<br/>
<br/>
I went to Portland, OR. by the way.<br/>
Managed to find about a dozen boxes while out there.<br/>
The parks out there are something else.  Huge cedar trees and other <br/>
types too.<br/>
<br/>
Going to Maine with the family on vacation next week.<br/>
Bar Harbor and Acadia Park.  Should be some great scenery.<br/>
I have my eye on a couple of boxes up there.<br/>
Hope everyone is healthy and happy.<br/>
Raindear <br/>

<div>You were sorely missed!! We'll just have to have another gathering so everyone can come back when it's a better time for you! Good luck on your trip. I am writing this from New Hampshire. I've gotten 9 boxs this weekend and met up with two very nice local boxers for exchanges and guidance. We are having a blast! Good luck and safe journey.<br/><br/><b><i>Cyclonic07@...</i></b> wrote:</div>
