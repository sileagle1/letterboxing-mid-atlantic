The Letterboxer's Tour of Georgetown has been updated.  Missing<br/>
microboxes have been replaced and all 10 are in their proper locations<br/>
as of 7/27/2006. (Note: Box #7 had to be moved slightly and the clue<br/>
has been updated).  <a href="http://dcheist.blogspot.com/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://dcheist.blogspot.com/</a><br/>

A Word About Urban Boxing...<br/>
When searching out and retrieving these microboxes, you have to be<br/>
patient.  Night time boxing is probably the best solution when a<br/>
reduced number of people are around.  Establish yourself in a given<br/>
location and take the time to retrieve and then to rehide/replace<br/>
properly.  DO NOT ATTEMPT A LOCATION IF YOU ARE IN A HURRY AND CANNOT<br/>
REPLACE CORRECTLY.  The survival of this series or any urban series<br/>
relies on you to be patient, take your time and put the stamp securely<br/>
back where it was planted.</div>
