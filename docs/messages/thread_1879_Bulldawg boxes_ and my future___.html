                    <div id="ygrps-yiv-460604477">OK..it was a year ago on July 31, 2005..that I found my first <br/>
box..thus is the last weekend to post this before my anniversary...the <br/>
clues for "a dawg is born" will be released on 7/31/2006, and is a <br/>
small tribute to what this hobbie brought me, and a thanks to the bud <br/>
that brought me to the sport, Koyote....we have had this talk, he <br/>
knows my gratitude...It was planted at the "stamp &amp; camp" gather, and <br/>
released to those folks that attended.,,,but not to the public til <br/>
7/31/06<br/>
<br/>
after that, I was motivated to plant like crazy, (I thought that was <br/>
the idea.....to plant like crazy, its not).....and with Gallant Rogue <br/>
as the biggest finder of my boxes...thank you, for the effort and all <br/>
the words we have had....<br/>
<br/>
many whom know me in the area, know I am a man of mystery..and after a <br/>
year of this hobbie, I can see why folks bore of it, and disappear <br/>
after a brief time (no offense).  I have tried to bring a  lot new to <br/>
it......All of my boxes are about to be retired, except a few..like <br/>
the American Indian Culture series, Ball's Bluff and a few <br/>
others......others will be pulled forever over the next few <br/>
weeks....and some clues have been pulled already...As the hobby <br/>
evolves, so will I.... It's a simple game, with simple idea.....but I <br/>
am a complex man, and like complex games, clues and boxes.  I feel we <br/>
all need cooler clues, and make this game more challenging...not just <br/>
about dartmoor, but Americanized.<br/>
<br/>
To ALL finders, and reporters....this hobby has opened my eyes to <br/>
hiking, and nature...and for that I owe my bud, Koyote....  He showed <br/>
me letterboxing, but that was the tip of the iceburg, in the greater <br/>
scheme of hiking.  I have further realized that quanity is not <br/>
quality.....and some of my boxes have made people think, and evaluate <br/>
their lives....Its an awakening, and that is what draws me to <br/>
it....and why I want others to come to my boxes.  I want a place of <br/>
reflection, or appreciation of life.  I feel after this year, that I <br/>
have actually grown as a person, and realized a lot about myself.  <br/>
better yet, I have seen things on longer hikes that I would have never <br/>
seen in my Life, especially on the Appilachain Trail in VA.  It puts <br/>
life in perspective..and made me rethink A lot of stuff...that is what <br/>
I take from this, and is my motto:  "It's not about the box, but the <br/>
place the box has taken you to"......the stamp is always secondary, <br/>
and after about 8 months of boxing, and hiking Great Falls VA..I <br/>
realized that.<br/>
<br/>
after this one year, I have met a few boxers and ....and I just wanna <br/>
say thanks for you warm welcomes: Hikers and Hounds, Ms Scarlet, <br/>
SewSowBizzy, all the END GANG!, geckospot, Tempis Fugit, J &amp; R, Poison <br/>
Ivy, funky feline, spidey, all day dream, cyclonic (for the ride), and <br/>
WINK and Tar Heel....my party buds<br/>
<br/>
Id say 75-85% of my future plants are for the locals I trust, or for <br/>
folks that want long hikes, extreme, or adult boxes<br/>
<br/>
thanks again to all the locals and lurkers</div>
