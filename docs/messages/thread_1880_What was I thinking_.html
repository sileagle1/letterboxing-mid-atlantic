Yesterday I went to find a series by Jay Drew.  Just three boxes on a loop <br/>
around a lake.  But I missed one of the clues, and Jay's clues can be vague <br/>
sometimes (on purpose).  I realized too late that after I found the first one, I <br/>
missed the last two, and had arrived back at the beginning of the loop already. <br/>
 So I had to go around again...<br/>

myself when I'm hunting Jay's boxes and try to guess where I can enter <br/>

the box.  He's notorious for taking the (sometimes not so) scenic <br/>

have to go back and start all over. But it's worth it!<br/>

</span></blockquote>  In my business we have a saying:  <br/>
"It's better to beg forgiveness than ask permission."  As long as you are careful, responsible <br/>
and not out to hurt anyone, it works pretty well.   That's state highway property.  What do <br/>
you think they would say if you asked about hiking?  How about leaving a box there? <br/>
<br/>
 I once had to get permission to videotape traffic on the blue route,  It practically took an act <br/>
of the state legislature.  PENNDOT sent out 3 people to supervise us and it took two hours to <br/>
get everyone together in one place.   A few months later I needed traffic footage for another <br/>
job.  We pulled over and shot it.  It took five minutes.  When the state police stopped us, we <br/>
told him what we were doing, apologized and went on our way.</div>
