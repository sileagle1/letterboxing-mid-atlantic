NH.  This is not a spoiler, but we had found FDRR once and then <br/>
tried to go back to launch a HH there but could not find it a second <br/>
time.  I think that I recall seeing an attempt posted recently - <br/>
maybe someone just put it back in a different spot, or maybe it's <br/>
actually gone.<br/>
<br/>
However, you might consider aiming for one of the excellent "Into <br/>
the Woods" series boxes that are also placed at Brandywine Creek SP.<br/>
