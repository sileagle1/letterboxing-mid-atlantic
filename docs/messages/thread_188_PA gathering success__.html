Saturday-- I must say Thank you to H&amp;H-- Irene you did an amazing <br/>
job coordinating this event, it was divine!  It was so nice to meet <br/>
other boxers, exchange images, and do a little boxing in the area. I <br/>
was just curious, who carved the event stamp?  It was really cool!   <br/>
I also wanted to say that I hope I see you all on the trails soon. <br/>
