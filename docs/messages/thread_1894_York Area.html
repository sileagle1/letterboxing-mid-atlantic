print out a bunch of boxes for the York area.  I'll have internet access while <br/>
I'm there, but there's no telling how long the site will be down.  :/  Aside <br/>
from the ones on AQ, would anyone be able to hook me up with with some area <br/>
clues?  Anything you might have saved on your hard drive or anything?  (You <br/>
should see the stash of CT clues I have on my hard drive.  They're coming in handy <br/>
now!)  I'm specifically interested in the one at Gettysburg, but I'll take <br/>
anything and everything you're offering!<br/>

<br/>
I think if you touch base with Pink Panther and Black Swan or Team <br/>
Litle Dog and they can set you up with many York area box clues.  <br/>
They are the primary planters in the York area.<br/>
