Walking on the trails of Cape May Pink Panther (PP) and Black Swan <br/>
(BS) spy a very deceased frog on the trail, belly up.<br/>
PP, in her best scientific voice explains she knows exactly what <br/>
happen to the frog - he croaked.<br/>
<br/>
New funny:<br/>
BS &amp; PP walking the trails of beautiful Berks County find a very <br/>
lively large frog on the trail.<br/>
BS: Wish I had an aquarium at home to take him home too.<br/>
PP: That's not right.  You know "Leave only footprints, take only <br/>
memories"....<br/>
BS: His name is Memory.<br/>
<br/>
What's your funny from the trail?<br/>
