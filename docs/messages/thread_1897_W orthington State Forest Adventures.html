Forest in NJ yesterday.  This is also known as the Delaware Water Gap.<br/>
<br/>
We were able to find Riversol's Vision Quest box, last found in Dec <br/>
2004 by our Jedi Master, Silent Doug.  Lephantman's Lost Clues <br/>
obviously pointed to a lost box.  Oh well, fool us once!<br/>
<br/>
Wingfoot's W orthington State Forest series was well worth the hiking <br/>
and climbing we did.  We managed to snag both and observed the <br/>
guardian of the Sunfish Pond box slither and rattle as it made sure <br/>
we were not muggles.  I did manage to put a photo in under <br/>
miscellaneous.  They should be the last ones.  I took it on a cell <br/>
phone, which made the rattler rattle.  Other than that we were not <br/>
perceived as a threat.<br/>
<br/>
We also saw a porcupine (first time in the wild for us for one of <br/>
those rascals) on the way up to the summits.<br/>
<br/>
Saw many areas for potential future eevil and normal boxes...<br/>

From this point on, that area will forever be known to me as "W<br/>
orthington State Forest" (pronounced "Double-You Orthington State<br/>
Forest").  <br/>
<br/>
Highly recommended!<br/>

to keep up. I know that I have hamstrings and I've recently<br/>
rediscovered my quadriceps, something that I don't use often on hikes<br/>
in the pine flats. My adductors are still, sadly, MIA. I hope to be<br/>
ready for a hairy legged adventure, moderate elevation, in a month or so.<br/>
