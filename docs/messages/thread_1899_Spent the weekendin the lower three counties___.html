And yeah!  Can't wait for the DE gather.  I'll have<br/>
many great reasons to go south of the canal.  Seems<br/>
easier to get to Philly and NJ than to go south.<br/>

Whatcha doing sitting in traffic?  If you end up on<br/>

YES indeedee  HnH has carved up a couple of wonderful stamps.  Best <br/>

don't miss out!<br/>
