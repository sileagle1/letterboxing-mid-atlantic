Celtic Pride hosted a gathering in May that 8 camped over for and 4 people stopped by and it was just as much fun. And no, not all have t-shirts. Ihis gathering grew out of me wanting letterboxing t-shirts in a color other than white (I am an amazing slob). So I decided to do my own and offer them for sale to others since there was a 75 piece minimum order for color logo's. So they all sold and we got together. I did the shirts and the guidebook as well as picked the place and date. Everyone else did all the other stuff. I didn't have to bring any food as everyone else did. It was very cool. Letterboxers are a great bunch of folks. Go to as many gatherings as you can, you'll have a blast!<br/><br/><b><i>Art Vandelay &lt;warcat1976@...&gt;</i></b> wrote:
