Take water.<br/>
Keep moving or use bug repellent.  The deer flies and<br/>
skeeters aren't too bad if you keep moving.<br/>
<br/>
Enjoy!<br/>
<br/>
Pack water and a snack, this is a long hike. This<br/>
series is placed on the longest trail in the Delaware<br/>
Trail Challenge. Stop by any Delaware state park<br/>
office for a list of trails and your own trail<br/>
challenge card, as well as a trail map. Don't forget<br/>
the water!<br/>

<br/>
To find box #1 start the trail challenge hike on the<br/>
Swamp Forest Trail. Proceed clockwise around the pond.<br/>
Pass the beach and disc golf course. Pause in the open<br/>
space at the base of a stand of pines and find the 2<br/>
LARGE 3-fingered trees. Walk between these giants<br/>
toward a 2-fingered tree by a stream. See that smaller<br/>
nondescript tree on the right? Your prize is there.<br/>
<br/>
Return to the trail and continue around the pond.<br/>
Watch for a large flat rock on the left just before a<br/>
bridge. Isn't that a great place to rest? Once you're<br/>
rested, face the rock and look into the woods at<br/>
11:00. From that tree go back about 10 steps (placer<br/>
is short!) to the 2-trunked tree on your right. Box is<br/>
under rocks. Watch out for the groundhog burrows. T<br/>
<br/>
For box #3 return to the trail and continue. Pass the<br/>
boat ramp. Cross 4 wooden bridges but do not take the<br/>
bridge that prohibits horses. Take the horse trail at<br/>
this point to the rock pile on the right. With your<br/>
back to the rock pile go to the fallen tree across the<br/>
trail. This prize is under the tree, on the right,<br/>
close to a rusty fence post. <br/>
<br/>
