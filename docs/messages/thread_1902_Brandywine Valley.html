Any idea what parks you'd like to hit?<br/>
HNH's series in Valley Garden is lovely, a more formal<br/>
park.<br/>
<br/>
Brandywine Creek has lots of boxes, including several<br/>
of Sheba's, on both sides of the creek.  I like this<br/>
park a lot.<br/>
<br/>
Carousel Park is nice if you also want to see horses<br/>
or the dog park.<br/>
<br/>
Brandywine Springs park is free, has several boxes<br/>
planted, is fairly small, and has the historical bonus<br/>
of having been the home of an old amusement park. <br/>
It's being refurbished but historical boards are neat<br/>
to read.<br/>
<br/>
I haven't been to Rockwood yet but understand it<br/>
contains another series.  Another more formal park w/<br/>
mansion.  It's also the site of this year's<br/>
Shakespeare Festival - Much Ado About Nothing.  Very<br/>
good play, esp. the evening show, and only $8. And<br/>
there is a show tomorrow night!  I recommend a picnic!<br/>

Just sent you an email full of clues - I was in Delaware County, PA,<br/>
last weekend and northern Delaware state in June and still have most<br/>
of the clues.  Let me know if you need more!<br/>
