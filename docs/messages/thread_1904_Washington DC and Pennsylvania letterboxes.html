there.  From past research, I know there are some letterboxes in Georgetown 
and Rock Creek Park in DC and I know there are two that were planted by 
EllBee in Alexandria, VA that I wanted to try.  I have a copy of Here Comes 
the Son from EllBee but I wanted a copy of the other one.  I can't remember 
the title of it, though.  I found some letterboxes that are in Rock Creek 
Park (Birthday Kids, Our Nation's Capitol, A Scroll of Many Words, and Kid 
Gloves).  Does anyone know of any others that I can print out before I 
go? </span></font></div>

<br/>
First, do a search for letterboxing.org on the Way Back Macine on<br/>
www.archive.org. You will see a whole list of dates that the site was<br/>
archived. Choose the most recent.<br/>
<br/>
Now, often the Way Back Machine does not arcive the entire site, but<br/>
just the most popular pages, so clues to individual boxes may not be<br/>
found. In this case, Google is your friend.<br/>
<br/>
Google the name of the box you are looking for (it often helps to put<br/>
the word "letterbox" in the search field too). When you come up with<br/>
the results, most likely the box you want will be right at the top, look<br/>
just below it and you will see a link that says "cached" and click on<br/>
that link, and is will have the most recent saved page for the box.<br/>
<br/>
Now remember, this will not always work, if a box was brand new it may<br/>
not have been cached anywhere. Also, the cached pages are older, so<br/>
clues may have changed. But, heck, it is better then nothing, and 9<br/>
times out of 10 you will find what you are looking for.<br/>
<br/>
____________________________________________________________<br/>
<br/>
As for boxes down by Independance Hall, sorry, there are none that I <br/>
know of.  There are a few in nearby Fairmont Park and in Northeast <br/>
Philly in Pennypack Park.  There are a ton in the surrounding suburbs, <br/>
Bucks, Montgomery, Chester and Delaware counties.<br/>

&gt; First, do a search for letterboxing.org on the Way Back Macine on<br/>
&gt; www.archive.org. You will see a whole list of dates that the site was<br/>
&gt; archived. Choose the most recent.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Now, often the Way Back Machine does not arcive the entire site, but<br/>
&gt; just the most popular pages, so clues to individual boxes may not be<br/>
&gt; found. In this case, Google is your friend.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Google the name of the box you are looking for (it often helps to put<br/>
&gt; the word "letterbox" in the search field too). When you come up with<br/>
&gt; the results, most likely the box you want will be right at the top, look<br/>
&gt; just below it and you will see a link that says "cached" and click on<br/>
&gt; that link, and is will have the most recent saved page for the box.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Now remember, this will not always work, if a box was brand new it may<br/>
&gt; not have been cached anywhere. Also, the cached pages are older, so<br/>
&gt; clues may have changed. But, heck, it is better then nothing, and 9<br/>
&gt; times out of 10 you will find what you are looking for.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; __________________________________________________________<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; As for boxes down by Independance Hall, sorry, there are none that I <br/>
&gt; know of. There are a few in nearby Fairmont Park and in Northeast <br/>
&gt; Philly in Pennypack Park. There are a ton in the surrounding suburbs, <br/>
&gt; Bucks, Montgomery, Chester and Delaware counties.<br/>

&gt; &gt;  &gt; Nathan, is your LOVE box still there? If so, that isn't too far <br/>
&gt; from<br/>
&gt; &gt;  &gt; Independence Hall -- could be done going into or out of the <br/>
&gt; city.<br/>
&gt; &gt;  &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;  &gt; -- the B's<br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; Several reports indicate that it is missing, but then again, some <br/>
&gt; people <br/>
&gt; &gt; can't figure out exactly where the starting point is (and no, I am <br/>
&gt; not <br/>
&gt; &gt; going to help them with that one).<br/>
