Cyclonic and I will be partaking in the Orienteering meet in the <br/>
eastern part of the park (though Sheeba and I will not start until  <br/>
about noon due to family things).  The crop circle aliens will be <br/>
planting their final crop circle near the nexus of blue and yaller <br/>
near the nexus of the other four.<br/>
<br/>
Then the gang will meet up with NHDude for assorted boxious <br/>
activities.  We figure around 2-2:30 or so.<br/>
<br/>
We were wondering whether you'd be able to get north of I-76.  We are <br/>
relieved, as we thought your car had one of those ankle security <br/>
bracelets that would not let it go North or West.<br/>
<br/>
Happy investigating,<br/>
