the event organized by Hikers and Hounds.<br/>
<br/>
While we were down at Washington's Crossing we joked about re-naming <br/>
the park the "Pennsylvania State Poison Ivy Reserve (PSPIR)".  With <br/>
that in mind, I was wondering how many folks came down with a case of <br/>
poison ivy...<br/>
<br/>
I'm thinking of making a stamp with a poison ivy plant that I can <br/>
incorporate into a postal letterbox to mail to folks that came down <br/>
with it.  The problem is, I have NO clue what goes into a PLB, <br/>
although I know poison ivy pretty well.  I'm thinking of snail-<br/>
mailing it out to victims from the "PSPIR gathering" once I see what <br/>
a PLB looks like (I'm on a couple of mailing lists).  I cannot <br/>
guarantee when that will be, but whoever was smitten by the "PA state <br/>
flower" and responds to this board or me (via email) with their email <br/>
address and itchy tail from our gathering, I'll add you to the list.<br/>
<br/>
I'll email you for your snail mail address once the stamp is carved <br/>
and send the itchy PLB on its way.<br/>

<div> </div>
<div>That is a great idea! A Postal, like a letterbox is whatever you want! You saw Judy B.s (sewbusy) Martha/Mr. Potato Head box, very creatve, very cool. My "Truckin" box has a way cool stamp, an insert which is a "pretend" tour poster as the stamp is a way to promote the BEST BAND EVER, the Grateful Dead and a tie dye pad.<br/></div>
<div>Yours could have your stamp, some photo images of poison ivy during all seasons. Many people only know it as a red and shiny 3-leaf plant, not the beautiful emerald green monster that was all over yesterday. And maybe relief suggstions? As many know I was squatting in poison ivy all Friday night with out realizing it (note to self, pick your "overnight tree" before it gets dark and you get drunk) and have been using Technu for the first time in all the right places. So far, those areas are okay, but I forgot to treat my feet and ankles and they have a nice, non-stop itch and are blooming beautifully. So I am trying Technu for the after rash too. I'll let everyone know how it works for me. Anyway, those are just a couple of ideas but go with whatever you want. It's your box, your medium to create. (scratch, scratch)</div>

(Those of you that didn't camp really missed out!)  It was great to <br/>
meet so many boxers from other states and see some stamps that we <br/>
don't see much of in our area (CT).   Thanks so much Irene! <br/>
<br/>
Regarding the poison ivy, we didn't get any, but we also wore <br/>
jeans.  If you think you've come in contact with poison ivy though, <br/>
you should rub the juice of a Jewelweed plant on the exposed area. <br/>
(We boxed with someone who sat in poison ivy and helped her find <br/>
some Jewelweed - did it work?)  I believe someone posted a pic of <br/>
Jewelweed on the national listserve.  <br/>
<br/>
Thanks to everyone for a great time!<br/>
