oh, and i have noticed that saturday night, what you call a meteor <br/>
shower, will wow your little minds. you humans are so funny. don't you <br/>
think it is coincidence that this so called meteor shower is happening <br/>
the same weekend that we invade your state. we don't. enjoy the <br/>
streaks of light, but watch them from inside. for if you don't, you <br/>
might not like what you see.<br/>
