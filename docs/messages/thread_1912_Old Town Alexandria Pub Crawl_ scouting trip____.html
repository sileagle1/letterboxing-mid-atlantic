food, and of course..the beer.  For those of you that havent been <br/>
there, It awesome.  So out-of-towners, dont be afraid to make a long <br/>
weekend of it and come down for "Skullduggery" on Sat. November 4th, <br/>
2006.<br/>
<br/>
I enjoyed the day with the family, scouted some establishments, and <br/>
found a few hiding spots.  I can only imagine how lively the area is <br/>
on a Saturday night.  I forgot how massive that place is.  I have got <br/>
my inspiration for some ideas for the event.<br/>

...Just gotta see what Mr. Rogue has up his sleeve.</div>
