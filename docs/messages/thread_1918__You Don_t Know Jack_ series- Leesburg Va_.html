  I have had 2 reports of "Jack Attack" having gone missing, so I <br/>
suspect it is so at this point until I can confirm it. "Jack" has been <br/>
attempted twice but not found, due to either construction in the area <br/>
or the barn is completely cut off from summer growth. It is, however, <br/>
still active as of last find earlier this summer. Another box was <br/>
reported missing, though the boxers, I believe, were not looking in the <br/>
right area.  I will get out to check these boxes soon as possible. As <br/>
this series was supposed to be a limited time series when I first <br/>
carved them for Halloween, I will not replace the boxes and will likely <br/>
pull the remainder of the series. Safe trails!<br/>
