could have a good image to carve for Judy. Well while I was there I ran into my friend Jim <br/>
who used to own the "cork he said he had run across some stuff while cleaning out his old <br/>
office and I might be interested in it. Not many people know that Johnny and June Cash <br/>
spent alot of time in Lewes with thier friends, John and Michell. On one of these visits they <br/>
spent an evening at the cork to hear ayoung band they had heard about, Love Seed <br/>
Momma Jump. Well the guys in the band were pretty excited about this so on the spot they <br/>
came up with a song. They only played it the one time and nobody wrote down the lyrics. <br/>
Except my friend Jim, he scribbled them on a napkin and tossed it in his desk. The napkin <br/>
had been in the desk quite a few years and was hard to read I don't know if I got it all <br/>
down but this is close as I could come.<br/>
I keep a close watch on this box of mine<br/>
I keep my eyes wide open all the time<br/>
Because it's mine i walk the trail<br/>
<br/>
I look for trees to carve my line<br/>
First ones full I'll try the second<br/>
Because it's mine I walk the trail<br/>
<br/>
You got to go a way off the trail to the south<br/>
16 steps should be enough<br/>
Because it's mine I walk the trail<br/>
<br/>
I'm standing on the middle of 3 big rocks<br/>
I'm facing my home in the east<br/>
Destiny is at my right foot<br/>
Because it's mine I walk the trail<br/>
<br/>
It's no Walk the Liine but I kinda like it.</div>
