Philly. Great stamps and logbooks in a great park (we were actually walking <br/>
in that park a couple of weeks ago and lamenting the fact that there were <br/>
no letterboxes there, so it was nice to visit again and find a bunch of <br/>
boxes!). We rode our bikes, too, which made returning to our starting point <br/>
much easier. We were the third to complete the series (though some people <br/>
had found one or two of the others).<br/>
<br/>
Fleur de lis, the first three containers are already cracked, and any outer <br/>
baggies that were still on any of the boxes were all torn. Those Gladware <br/>
containers just don't stand up very well in a letterboxing environment (and <br/>
neither do outer baggies), so you might consider replacing them soon with <br/>
something sturdier. I like the Milan Classic (by Holiday) boxes that you <br/>
can get at Dollar Tree for $1 in various sizes. They stand up really well <br/>
and are waterproof -- and are inexpensive.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for the letterboxes!<br/>

cracks (I only knew about one of them to date)... so thanks for the <br/>
update. Now I really have to get moving, and hope that this downpour <br/>
we've been having doesn't destroy them all!<br/>
