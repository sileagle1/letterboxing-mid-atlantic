for anyone who was waiting for us at our intended targets, sorry for <br/>
not showing. we kinda got stuck in NYC traffic. next year, i think <br/>
that we will not be boxing the day of the travel, but the next in the <br/>
area we decide to go. on the bright side, we enjoyed meeting everyone <br/>
and have a blast. i hope to see everyone again real soon. maybe not in <br/>
the alien form!<br/>
