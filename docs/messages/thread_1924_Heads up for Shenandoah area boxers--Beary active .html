  Posted this to AQ, and wanted to pass it along here as well.<br/>
<br/>
For anyone hiking around the Massanutten Mountain area/ Elizabeth <br/>
furnace area; I ran into not one, but two bears today on ajaunt up to <br/>
Buzzard Rock. The first one was a good 700 lbs and the biggest bear <br/>
I've seen. He was kind enough to run off when I started whistling and <br/>
waving my arms ( I had a goal to reach afterall). His departure was <br/>
welcome so as to not to continue wetting my pants. The second bear was <br/>
a few hours later and much smaller. I was able to get some pics for the <br/>
kids. The bear attack last month was on my mind, though that person <br/>
provoked the bear. Just a heads up that our bear friends are active in <br/>
the area. Use your heads and common sense if out and about in the <br/>
woods. Safe trails.<br/>

<div> I have thought about bells, but, to be honest, I want to be able to 
get close to seeing the animals in the wild if I can. I feel comfortable enough 
to do so. I would have booked back the other way when I encountered the first 
bear, but the trail was rocky and he would have caught up to me easily. I 
briefly thought about the camera, but we had pretty much stumbled into each 
others path and I didn't want him so close as to think he was out of 
options.</div>
<div>  Just so you know Irene, and I'm sure Dude is very protective; the 
bear attack in this area involved a mountain biker who goes out with his dog 
almost daily. The dog got whiff of the bear and went to play or fight, but 
tangled with the bear making it feel it was backed up. The mountain biker heard 
the dog barking then yelping. He jumped off the bike and went into the brush to 
find the bear holding the dog down. The guy, apparently not thinking well, 
charged the bear which turned on him ( duh!). The guy and his dog ended up 
getting away, fortunately. The dog will have the scars to prove his valor 
judging by the pic I saw. The Ranger that was interviewed didn't seem to put any 
blame on the bear. :)   </div>

<div><font face="Arial" size="2">Oh my - I was trying to talk my husband into hiking 
up there yesterday! I'm terrified about running into a bear or wild beast. I 
clip on a bunch of keys on my backpack to make noise. If I'm by myself way back 
in the woods I'll blow a whistle every once in awhile. My kids make fun of me 
but I don't want to surprise any wild animals. I was hiking in Sky Meadows 
a wk ago and was at the John Mosby letterbox- A woman &amp; her dog came down 
from the north trail and she warned that I better make noise as a bear growled 
at her &amp; the dog. She seemed remarkably calm. I would have been shrieking 
down the hill. As it was I just turned around and went back the way I came in 
and continued to get the other letterboxes in the park. Hikinghams</font></div>

As for bells, some researchers think that a bear can't distinguish <br/>
between a bell and the background noise of the forest.  Mostly, bells <br/>
tell me when other hikers are coming, which is still useful <br/>
information.<br/>
<br/>
Running from bears is easy - you have no chance.  They top out at 35 <br/>
MPH - by comparison, the Olympic-record holder in the 100 meter dash <br/>
was going 22 MPH.<br/>

&gt; I've heard that singing songs by the Offspring can work as well.  I <br/>
&gt; have only seen a bear on the trail once, up in the DWG some years <br/>
&gt; back, but I am certain that I have heard them hightailing it into <br/>
the <br/>
&gt; woods when we come noisily down the trail other times.<br/>

&gt; &gt; Wow, this is my biggest fear about hiking alone. Although they <br/>
say <br/>
&gt; black bers hate barking dogs and noise, so I always count on Dude <br/>
to <br/>
&gt; raise a ruckus. Wow, soering indeed to a weenie like me! I did hear <br/>
&gt; tying bells to you back pack is a good idea in bear country. <br/>
