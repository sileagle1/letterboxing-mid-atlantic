Walnutport Canal Trail series, is active.  This series is listed in<br/>
the letterboxing basement.  The box had seen some significant water<br/>
damage, but I cleaned it up and put it back out where it belongs.  So,<br/>
when you come up to the beautiful Lehigh Valley to visit the home of<br/>
so many LB &amp; IV boxes (and many others), add this one to your list! <br/>
After two attempts, I could not find the second box in the series...my<br/>
guess is it's a casualty of either the flood of '04, '05, or '06.  <br/>
