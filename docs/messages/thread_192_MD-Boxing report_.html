Sounds like the folks who attended the wknd event had lots of fun. My <br/>
family and I went out here in AA Co. to hit some boxes just in case <br/>
they get pulled. Hope they don't though, so if ya have a box in and <br/>
AA Co. park, please contact them for a permission letter. (See my <br/>
post about Anne Arundel Co.)Over the 2 days we went after 6 total <br/>
boxes with the following results.<br/>
Downs Park-Amazing park with nice view. We took two friends and <br/>
introduced them to boxing. Lots of fun. Found 2 for 2. Both in nice <br/>
spots and good area. Our friends really enjoyed them and will <br/>
continue boxing. I hope the placers of the boxes get permission and <br/>
maybe more boxes in the park. It is a perfect local.<br/>
Arbology-Went after them on Sun. with just us.(The Woodwooses). These <br/>
boxes are in White Marsh Park in Bowie MD. Prince Georges County so <br/>
not threatened with removal. This park is by far our favorite boxing <br/>
experience so far. Amazing series of trails in a non-rural area. The <br/>
woods of White Marsh are great. Unforuantely! :'( the first two boxes <br/>
had been found by someone not nice! <br/>
#1 was totally missing, and then we noticed the rain soaked strips of <br/>
the journal. Found part of its cover. <br/>
#2 box missing, journal distroyed and striped of its pages. We found <br/>
the cover and the STAMP! thrown in a bush. I will contact the placer <br/>
and see if I can mail it to them. This was obviously done by a <br/>
person. The way the journal pgs were strew down the path made it <br/>
certain. I am assuming that the first one was found by accident and <br/>
had the clues to #2 in it.<br/>
#3 We found it. Hidden abit better than the first two and I think the <br/>
trasher of the boxes gave up. (Mama Woodwose and Lil'Dragon couldn't <br/>
at first and called in me as reinforcements.) Nice box in good shape. <br/>
I would say that it's my opinion that the little glad sandwich <br/>
containers don't make the best boxes. We put it back tight with a <br/>
little duff strew over it and added double bagging and info flyers to <br/>
it. <br/>
We also went after the first of "Who let the Horses out." We found <br/>
certainly the right spot and looked hard. Poking behind trees and <br/>
such but no luck. It could be there. I'm sure these are good trails <br/>
here for the right boxers. But I don't recomend them for the family <br/>
with young kids.(As the clues clearly stated)Even the 1st box is a <br/>
little rough area, and the the trails are also used by some shady <br/>
folks. Lots of liquor bottles around and what looked like a homeless <br/>
squat. <br/>
Still a great time and getting us into new areas. Esp. White Marsh <br/>
Park, we decided that these are our favorites so far. <br/>
Peaceful Trails,<br/>
