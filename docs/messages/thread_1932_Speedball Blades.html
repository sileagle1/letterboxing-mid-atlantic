time I looked at it, but they mention the pink stuff like they are still<br/>
selling it. Their product page seemed to be just kits if I'm interpreting<br/>
it right, and their catalogs are now PDF files that it said was going to<br/>
take 13 minutes to download so I didn't. I guess a phone call would be<br/>
better. But it seems like they are still selling it, unless they are just<br/>
selling what they have left.<br/>
<br/>
But I saw no mention of anything like that. Hope not. The pink stuff is the<br/>
only medium I like carving on. They were talking it up, calling stamping<br/>
one of the "hottest trends in the craft industry", so I don't see how they<br/>
would stop making what so many people use. It flies off the shelves in most<br/>
places. <br/>
