most of the finders on both our VA and NC boxes have mentioned being <br/>
newcomers to the hobby - they often say that one of ours was their first <br/>

I've gotten a ton of new boxers reporting finds on my boxes, <br/>
but only a couple of clue verification emails.    <br/>

Most of my hits from new boxers are pretty much for my easy boxes.  <br/>
Most have found success, but there have been some difficulties.  <br/>
Though, I am certain that I may start hearing for requests for help <br/>
for some of the mysteries.<br/>
