We are going to be in Philadelphia in mid-September, and would<br/>
appreciate advice as to boxes in the area.<br/>
<br/>
We're staying near Independence Park and would love to hear if there<br/>
are any walking distance boxes - my husband is attending a conference<br/>
so I'll be on foot for several days. On the weekend we'll be mobile so<br/>
would like to go to an area that has a concentration of boxes.<br/>
<br/>
Also, does anyone know of any quick boxes near I-95 from Baltimore to<br/>
Philadelphia?<br/>
<br/>
Thanks!<br/>

<br/>
There is quite a concentration of boxes in Rockwood Park, just north <br/>
of Wilmington, DE, and right off I-95, about 45 minutes from Center <br/>
City Philadelphia.  There are at least 5 boxes there and another in <br/>
the adjacent Bellevue State Park.  Both parks are pretty small and <br/>
finding all the boxes in Rockwood should not take more than a couple <br/>
of hours, depending on how long you linger over the log books.<br/>
<br/>
There is also a box outside Iron Hill Museum, in Newark, DE, which is <br/>
also very close to I-95 and a quick find.<br/>
<br/>
There are boxes in Pennypack Park in Philly.  I'm not sure if they <br/>
are close enough or safe enough to walk from Independence Mall as I <br/>
get lost in that part of Philly myself.<br/>
<br/>
By the way, I enjoyed your boxes in Buxton last year and plan to <br/>
spend next week looking for all those new ones!<br/>

There is supposed to be another box at the same stop, placed by <br/>
CAVALIER Manor, called Gas-n-Go, but we could not find it, and it's <br/>
rumored to be gone.  It might still bear checking - if we just missed <br/>
it or it has been replaced then it will be close to H-n-H's box.<br/>

&gt; &gt; If you're going to be in Philly then I've got to<br/>
&gt; &gt; put a plug in for Tyler State Park, about 30-40<br/>
&gt; &gt; minutes from Center City. I-95 North to the<br/>
&gt; &gt; Newtown-Yardely exit, left at the top of the ramp.<br/>
&gt; &gt; Stay on that road for a few miles (4-5?) Tyler<br/>
&gt; &gt; entrance is on the left. There are ton's of boxes<br/>
&gt; &gt; there. OR drive past the main entrance, pass the<br/>
&gt; &gt; Community College, left into the Schfield Ford<br/>
&gt; &gt; Covered Bridge Entrance, 1/2 ton of boxes there.<br/>
&gt; On<br/>

Thanks for all the responses. I guess we were hoping for more downtown
boxes than we could see listed...oh, well. We'll check on LOVE,
although all the 'attempted's are a bit discouraging..<br/>
<br/>
Unfortunately, we'll have to give Tyler a miss this time. Our time and
travel constraints won't allow us to travel that much further north;
plus, we'll have kids with us so a boxing mecca wouldn't be feasible
(they like boxing but not hiking and only a few boxes at a time). It
definitely sounds like we'll have to put Tyler on our list for a
child-free weekend trip, though...we're due for another dawn-to-dusk
boxing frenzy. ;-&gt;<br/>
<br/>
We've noted the I-95 drive-by suggestions - thanks! Any further
suggestion on sites we might hit on Sunday on our way back to the
Baltimore area would be much appreciated. We just *have* to bag at
least one PA and DE box, since we have none there yet! <br/>
<br/>
Thanks again,<br/>
