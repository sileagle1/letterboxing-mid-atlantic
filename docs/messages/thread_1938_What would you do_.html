possible.  Last summer, we found "Coward" in terrible shape.  The <br/>
stamp was missing and the logbook was so soaked that we couldn't <br/>
turn the pages.  We did our best to dry it out but it was a lost <br/>
cause, along with that beautiful stamp.<br/>
<br/>
This summer found us in the environs of the box again, and we <br/>
decided to check on it.  We were the last ones to log into the book, <br/>
over a year ago (although I believe others may have found it since <br/>
then, based on the location we found it in).  On the theory that it <br/>
wasn't doing much good where it was, we made the tough call to pull <br/>
it for some maintenance.<br/>
<br/>
The rest of the B's are upstairs with a hair dryer, drying out the <br/>
logbook (that part alone has been fascinating; Wingfoot was the <br/>
first finder, Wanda and Pete are in there as well -- 15 finders, at <br/>
most, in all that time).  We have managed to dry out and separate <br/>
the page with the original image, which was absolutely amazing.<br/>
<br/>
What to do now?  I have contacted the placer but based on other <br/>
experience, I am not expecting a reply.  Should we just put it <br/>
back?  Would it be bad form to try and recarve a replica of the <br/>
stamp and replace it? <br/>

think my carving abilities would do it justice.  I am looking into <br/>
sending it out to a commercial stamp place to have them make a stamp <br/>
from the image.  Anyone have a place to recommend?<br/>
<br/>
I think we will put in a new logbook as well but include the original <br/>
for people to browse through.  Some images were lost entirely, <br/>
some "developed" when dried out.<br/>
