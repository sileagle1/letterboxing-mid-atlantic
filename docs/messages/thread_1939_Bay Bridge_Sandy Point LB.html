vacation in Maryland. It was in bad shape, but the stamp was still there. When they later <br/>
investigated the box clue, they noticed it had last been heard from in 2004, and that the <br/>
placer could no longer be contacted.<br/>
<br/>
I was able to locate and refurbish the box this morning. It now has the original stamp, a new <br/>
logbook (the old one was ruined), and a much better container. I will apply with Choi at LBNA <br/>
to adopt the box.<br/>

It is in its original place, and the original clues still apply, although there are one or two <br/>
references I will update once Choi and I work out the adoption.<br/>

The carver/placer was Monkeyshine, who it seems only planted this one box. The box now <br/>
contains an additional stamp that commemorates its rescue by that kind cacher, <br/>
Moore9KSUcats. Enjoy!<br/>

Heel) and I have searched for this box.  There is/was many, many, <br/>
many problems with "blow downs".  It is a fantastic place, and we <br/>
are both very happy to know that it is still "alive" after so many <br/>
times looking in the area.  I have e-mailed back and forth with the <br/>
owner (a year ago).  Good news.  I am glad that it is well.<br/>
