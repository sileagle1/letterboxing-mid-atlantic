vacation, so watch out ;-)<br/>
<br/>
Between all the coaster riding, driving, coaster riding, baseball, <br/>
coaster riding, camping, oh, and coaster riding, I did manage to get a <br/>
little bit of boxing in.<br/>
<br/>
I found a few boxes in Indiana, one was a nice little box across the <br/>
street from Holiday World called Santa Coaster, the other, Abe-The <br/>
Formative Years, in a patch of posion ivy at Abe Lincoln's childhood home.<br/>
<br/>
In Reedsburg, WI I discovered the wonderfully carved Herbie.<br/>
<br/>
Crossing over to Michigan I found Snug Harbor in Muskegon, MI.  While <br/>
there I planted Keystone Traveler: Bumping Around Michigan <br/>
(<a href="http://tinyurl.com/ewdwg)" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://tinyurl.com/ewdwg)</a>, a four box drive-by series.  I would like to <br/>
sometime return to this park, as it is nice and there are many more <br/>
boxes to find there.<br/>
<br/>
My first Canadian find was London Calling, a clever box outside London, ON.<br/>
<br/>
And then I was at the WNY Gathering, which was a blast and I would love <br/>
to do again.  I didn't do so much boxing as I did hanging out, and <br/>
watching others try and figure out Houdini's Great Escape.  That <br/>
Saturday Morning I did plant a box in Darien Lakes State Park, Heart and <br/>
Soul, which will but public soon.<br/>
<br/>
I cannot convey just how much fun the gethering was. Sprite, sans <br/>
Highlander who was off testing his edumacation, put on a great show, and <br/>
there were tons of boxes to seek out if you were so inclined.  Everyone <br/>
was wonderful, and the camping was great.  The weather even held off <br/>
long enough to get some D&amp;D in that night (letterboxers and D&amp;D, there <br/>
is a scary combination).<br/>
<br/>
Sunday I poked around and did get about a dozen boxes in the area.  I <br/>
stopped by Sprite's place and meet Highlander.<br/>
<br/>
All and all a great time all week, and I am beat now.<br/>
<br/>
Oh, one other thing, LB, the Borg Cube has now assimilated 6 new HH's, <br/>
while dropping off all that it had brought along.<br/>
<br/>
I look forward to seeing each and everyone of you (except Judy, you have <br/>
a good excuse) in a few weeks at Knoebels.  I am now fired up and hot to <br/>
trot to get things done, so watch out, I've got some neat stuff in store <br/>
for you all.<br/>
