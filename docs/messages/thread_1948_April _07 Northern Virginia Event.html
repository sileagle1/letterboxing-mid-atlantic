research for an event 8 months away.."the Loudoun County ADC Map <br/>
Letterboxing Challenge"....Read a brief bit about it on the events <br/>
page on AtlasQuest.com.  So far, with a bit of traveling by me the <br/>
past 2 weekends, and some research, I have come up with some things <br/>
that might be new to an event.  I will have great details at <br/>
Thanksgiving of this year.  Thanks to those that have signed up so <br/>
far, and those that have offered help. I was interested in seeing if <br/>
this event would catch on, and so far it has.....keep the responses <br/>
coming, and sign up now. <br/>
<br/>
At this time, even in the early stages, I am pretty siked with where <br/>
this is headed.  Sign up Early, and commit......It is key to the event.<br/>
