Chantilly VA and was contacted by a concerned citizen (geocacher) who<br/>
found an open tupperware container and a very soggy log book out in<br/>
the open.<br/>
<br/>
OK fellow boxers, time for some sleuthing!  Has anyone heard of this<br/>
box?  Do any of you know a family with a Kyle and Hannah in it?<br/>
<br/>
Maybe this was a girl scout outing pre-plant or an anonymous box for a<br/>
private party?<br/>
<br/>
There's a mystery afoot...<br/>
