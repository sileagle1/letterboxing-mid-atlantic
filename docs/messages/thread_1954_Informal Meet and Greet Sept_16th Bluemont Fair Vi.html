 The 37th Bluemont Fair (www.bluemontfair.com)is being held Sept. 16th <br/>
and 17th. I would like to invite people to come out for an informal <br/>
meet and greet on the 16th. Ditsyquoin, who is the postmistress for <br/>
Bluemont post office, will be stamping a special postal cancellation <br/>
stamp at the EE Lake Store. She'll stamp your log and you may get an <br/>
exchange along with it. She has also graciously offered the back lawn <br/>
of the post office as a meeting area for boxers to meet for exchanges. <br/>
I have carved a special "event only" stamp for the fair, and this stamp <br/>
will be retired after the fair. Clues to the box will be available at <br/>
the fair and probably by password only. I'll post the info just beofre <br/>
the fair.<br/>
  I may try to get another box or two planted as well, but there are <br/>
numerous other boxes nearby. The fair looks to be a great time for all <br/>
and a great way to check out the numerous country fairs that are coming <br/>
up for the Fall. Let me know if you want to meet at a certain time or I <br/>
can just state a time and plan on that. I will be there most of the day <br/>
on the 16th. Hope a few of you can make it out and welcome Ditsyquoin, <br/>
who is a new boxer in our midst, to the hobby. Safe trails!<br/>
