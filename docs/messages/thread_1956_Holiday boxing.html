EB-Bebe and I went on a boxing adventure in the Lower Three Counties <br/>
today.  We were accompanied by North Star and her dog Fin who is a <br/>
hyperactive ball of fluff.<br/>
<br/>
We first hunted down Oh, The Irony.  As stated, it is amazingly close to <br/>
the trail, and very clever as well.  We rehid it well, and it was <br/>
immediately tested by a couple who walked by.  They stopped right by the <br/>
tree so the woman could take a call on her cell.  She stood there <br/>
talking and was looking right where the box was hidden, but was none the <br/>
wiser.<br/>
<br/>
Afterwards we went for a ride before hitting the trail again in search <br/>
of the Possium Hill Explorer series.  All store bought stamps, but a <br/>
nice hike.  Funny, the planters called the first three boxes micro <br/>
boxes, though they turned out to be the size of my regular boxes.  I <br/>
wondered what they considered a regular size box, and found out with the <br/>
last box, which was gargantuain.<br/>
<br/>
All and all a nice day, great weather, some nice wooded hikes, and a <br/>
very tired Fin.<br/>
