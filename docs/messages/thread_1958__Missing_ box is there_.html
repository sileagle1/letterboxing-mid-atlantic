finding the very nice Ma &amp; Pa Box and Jerusalem Mill Froggie, I took a <br/>
chance and drove to Havre de Grace. The Concord Point Lighthouse box <br/>
had been listed as missing for some time, but it is definitely there. <br/>
Last finders before me were in mid-2005. The clue is no longer on <br/>
LBNA, but you can still find it on AtlasQuest (that's where it is <br/>
listed as "missing".<br/>
<br/>
It's well worth checking out. What a pleasure to find it, and in good <br/>
shape, too.<br/>
