<p class="ygrps-yiv-1548727953MsoNormal"><span style="FONT-SIZE:11pt;FONT-FAMILY:Arial;">Inspector Grogue, tired of eating beans and franks on the open fire at his campsite, had taken a meal at one of the popular restaurants on First Ave in Rehoboth Beach. While there he overheard the following conversation between a dapper dude and his partner. </span></p>
<p class="ygrps-yiv-1548727953MsoNormal"><span style="FONT-SIZE:11pt;FONT-FAMILY:Arial;">  </span></p>
<p class="ygrps-yiv-1548727953MsoNormal"><span style="FONT-SIZE:11pt;FONT-FAMILY:Arial;"><em>Dude</em> "Do you know what became of the Ramblin' Restaurant Review in the Coast-Connection? It hasn't been printed in the last two issues." </span></p>
<p class="ygrps-yiv-1548727953MsoNormal"><span style="FONT-SIZE:11pt;FONT-FAMILY:Arial;"><em>Partner</em> "I was wondering about that too. Didn't the headlines say some kids found a body floating in the Murderkill River two weeks ago? That food critic was pretty raw in his reviews, maybe it was him. He never did use his name in the byline." </span></p>
<p class="ygrps-yiv-1548727953MsoNormal"><span style="FONT-SIZE:11pt;FONT-FAMILY:Arial;"><em>Dude</em> "Yeah, I doubt the local dicks have made the connection. I understand they've been fishing for clues in the Murderkill River and at Killens Pond. They should be looking at the chefs he had reviewed." </span></p>
<p class="ygrps-yiv-1548727953MsoNormal"><span style="FONT-SIZE:11pt;FONT-FAMILY:Arial;"><em>Partner</em> "That's a gem of an idea. Should we respond to the call for help printed in the Coast-Connection?" </span></p>
<p class="ygrps-yiv-1548727953MsoNormal"><span style="FONT-SIZE:11pt;FONT-FAMILY:Arial;"><em>Dude</em> "Naw, they'll just rake you over the coals if they think you know something. Let's go, I need to stop at Royal Farms and get some cream to make that spice torte for the party tomorrow. What are you bringing?" </span></p>
<p class="ygrps-yiv-1548727953MsoNormal"><span style="FONT-SIZE:11pt;FONT-FAMILY:Arial;"><em>Partner</em> "Confit of chicken with crimi sauce over vermicelli. I found the recipe in that Matsuhisa magazine. I thought a carafe of pinot gris would compliment it nicely." </span></p>
<p class="ygrps-yiv-1548727953MsoNormal"><span style="FONT-SIZE:11pt;FONT-FAMILY:Arial;"><em>Dude</em> "I just hope that cafeteria cook from the elementary school isn't bringing his coddled egg creams." </span></p>
<p class="ygrps-yiv-1548727953MsoNormal"><span style="FONT-SIZE:11pt;FONT-FAMILY:Arial;">  </span></p>
<p class="ygrps-yiv-1548727953MsoNormal"><span style="FONT-SIZE:11pt;FONT-FAMILY:Arial;">Then the two got up and left the restaurant. Inspector Grogue dug in his pocket for some dough to pay the tab and hurried off to the Coast-Connection offices. He was almost there when an azure car made a sharp turn and Grogue had to take several side steps to avoid getting struck.   </span><span style="FONT-SIZE:11pt;FONT-FAMILY:Arial;"><font color="#0000bf"><strong>BAM!</strong></font> The car hit a trash can before tearing off down Rehoboth Avenue. Grogue barely had a chance to scan the person in the back seat but thought he recognized him from another recent photo in the Coast-Connection. </span></p>

 2006<br/>&gt; The identification of "Mr. Body", reported last week as found floating<br/>&gt; in Murderkill River, Fenton DE, is still a mystery.<br/>&gt; <br/>&gt; I talked with Inspector Grogue this morning and he tells me the autopsy<br/>&gt; revealed that Mr. Body was not only a man with a large appetite, but a<br/>&gt; diverse one. The contents of his stomach included such foods as:<br/>&gt; Poultry<br/>&gt; Pasta con fungi<br/>&gt; Sushi<br/>&gt; Wedding cake<br/>&gt; Blue crab<br/>&gt; a partially digested Gingerbread Man<br/>&gt; AND poison<br/>&gt; <br/>&gt; Because Mr. Body had apparently been in the river for several days it<br/>&gt; could not be determined in which food the poison had been administered. <br/>&gt; However, because of his size the poison was slow to take effect and he<br/>&gt; could have consumed several of the food items after its ingestion. <br/>&gt; Inspector Grogue is expanding his inquiries and will will report further<br/>&gt; developments when they
 occur.<br/>&gt; <br/>&gt; Meanwhile on page 6 a sketch and description of Mr. Body is printed. <br/>&gt; Maybe someone will be able to identify Mr. Body's body.<br/>&gt; <br/>&gt; From Prior LBMA POST 9578:<br/>&gt; &gt; Atlantic Coast and Delaware Connection Headline - WED Sept 6 2006<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; After a holiday weekend of letterboxing (see last month's article on<br/>&gt; &gt; this search for buried art) a local family found a very large body<br/>&gt; &gt; floating in the Murderkill River near Killens Pond State Park, Fenton<br/>&gt; &gt; DE. There was no identification and at present he is just called "Mr.<br/>&gt; &gt; Body" because of his well fed size.

<p>"Mr. Body" has been identified as one Philip Barnes Nathanial James. He frequented many Delaware restaurants and freelanced as a reviewer for the Atlantic Coast and Delaware Connection under the byline PBnJ. Apparently, using yet another nom de plume, he was also acting as a judge for the recent Labor Day Restaurant Rally. A number of the restaurants had brought in guest chefs, not the least famous being Emeril, Julia, Nobu plus the international Swedish Chef, an ethnic food specialist from South Park, and a Pastry Chef called in to replace Martha.</p>
<p>Inspector Grogue has been investigating any prior bad blood between PBnJ and these chefs. He is not without a bounty of evidence. But will any of it jell, o will Inspector Grogue find himself in a pickle?</p></font></div>

<p>Inspector Grogue has expanded his investigation throughout Kent and Sussex Counties. He has found that the restaurants have had false fronts making them difficult to identify. The Pastry Chef while known for his anatomically correct Gingerbread Men, may have been baking wedding cakes for the Labor Day wedding of Jesse and Jessie Jones. Emeril was perfecting one of his pasta dishes but won't reveal his new ingredient. Both poultry and blue crab are local delicacies and could be dangerous if not properly chilled. Where as the Swedish Chef, a long time rival of the Chef from South Park, is no longer a laughing matter.</p>
<p>Adding to the confusion, there is rumor of a confluence this coming Sunday, Oct 8, of letterboxers expected at the site where the body was found. Whether this will be a help in resolving this murder mystery or just a game for these visitors is yet to be reported.</p></font></div>
