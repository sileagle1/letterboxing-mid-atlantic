  I confirmed two of the boxes missing and went ahead and pulled the <br/>
remainder of the series. I have marked the boxes "retired" on AQ, and <br/>
archived the clues on LBNA. Thanks to all who came out, they were busy <br/>
boxes. Safe trails.<br/>

It was a lot of fun and I loved that they were spread all over Leesburg so I really got a nice sense of the town. <br/><br/><b><i>theendgang &lt;hurdhut@...&gt;</i></b> wrote:  <blockquote><span title="qreply"> <blockquote class="ygrps-yiv-611074822replbq" style="PADDING-LEFT:5px;MARGIN-LEFT:5px;BORDER-LEFT:#1010ff 2px solid;"> <div id="ygrps-yiv-611074822ygrp-text"> <div>Hi all,<br/>I confirmed two of the boxes missing and went ahead and pulled the <br/>remainder of the series.
