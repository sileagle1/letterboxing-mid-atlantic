<br/>
A quick intro!  We're newish boxers; we've been at it for about 2.5 mos and<br/>
have 10 finds so far.  We love the hobby and can't wait to do some planting,<br/>
too.  It's my husband's thing more than mine -- I just go along for the<br/>
hunting and keep the logbook.  :)  We're planning to be at Knoebels<br/>
tomorrow.  Can anyone tell me if we should bring food, etc for the<br/>
"gathering at the pavilion" part?  We will not be camping; this is just a<br/>
day trip for us.<br/>
<br/>
Looking forward to meeting you all --<br/>

<p>There isn't any mention of food on Atlasquest or the Penncoasters site -- so it would appear you just eat what Knoebels has to sell.  You won't go hungry.</p>
<p>Sorry I am currently in DE busy planting boxes for the next big LBMA gather - "It's Just a Game" on Oct 8 at Killens Pond State Park in Fenton DE.  That one will be loaded with boxes!!  So check out the details at <a href="http://de-games.tripod.com" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://de-games.tripod.com</a> </p>
<p>Everyone have a blast and I'm regretting I don't get to ride the rollercoasters again this year.</p>

could make it out.<br/>
<br/>
It was also happy to meet all the other new faces, too many to mention <br/>
really, as well as all the old familiar ones.  It is always a blast to <br/>
get together and play our little game, and I like to think of mine as <br/>
the more laid back type of gathering so that folks can get together and <br/>
just have some relaxed fun.<br/>
<br/>
I think next year will be more of the same.  I will hold it on the same <br/>
weekend, so mark your calenders now.  It will be the "No Chicken for <br/>
You" gathering ;-)<br/>
<br/>
Thanks to everyone that came out, and I look forward to seeing you all <br/>
at Boxtoberfest, if not sooner!<br/>
