with a message to e-mail us for cards with the old stamp when what we <br/>
should have done was to leave stamped cards there, or better yet, <br/>
given an alert.  Spring Chick suggested planting an entirely new box <br/>
in a slightly different location for people who already found the old <br/>
box, but the spot for this one is nearly perfect.  In nearly four <br/>
years in a spot very close to the water (after four seasons of winter <br/>
storms), the log book was still bone dry.  Long story short, there is <br/>
no stamp there currently (just a small temporary log), but we have <br/>
several cards with the old stamp for anyone who can identify the name <br/>
on the campaign poster at the old bait shop and/or the color of the <br/>
pencil we left behind.  Will replant in the same location with a new <br/>
stamp as soon as we get the chance.<br/>
