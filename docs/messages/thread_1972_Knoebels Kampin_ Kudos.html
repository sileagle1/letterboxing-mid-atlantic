&gt; Oh man!!! I'm so pissed I missed it! I had been really<br/>
&gt; looking forward to it but family obligations got in<br/>
&gt; the way. Tried to make it up on sun but had to help my<br/>
&gt; mother in law move. I won't miss the next one.<br/>

&gt; &gt; Kudos and thanks to all who attended the Knoebels<br/>
&gt; &gt; gathering. It was great to put some new faces to<br/>
&gt; &gt; stamps and see so many old friends. What a nice<br/>
&gt; &gt; surprise to actually meet that sainted woman, Mrs.<br/>
&gt; &gt; Lightnin' Bug! and the other littler' bug I hadn't<br/>
&gt; &gt; met yet. Plus all of the other folks I hadn't yet<br/>
&gt; &gt; had the privilege of meeting. So cool. My personal<br/>
&gt; &gt; favorite attendee was my little sister (46) Deb and<br/>
&gt; &gt; her dog Cody, who are the other half of the Hikers<br/>
&gt; &gt; and Hounds stamp image. Deb and Cody have only ever<br/>
&gt; &gt; been to one other event so I was very happy they<br/>
&gt; &gt; came. It was out on trail with Deb, Cody and Dude in<br/>
&gt; &gt; Jan 04 that we stumbled across a box not re-hidden<br/>
&gt; &gt; well and discovered letterboxing. <br/>

gathering!  I love the laid back atmosphere, and you can't beat the <br/>
rides!! Leafcutters, Cactus &amp; I spent a lot of time riding the bumper <br/>
cars and I almost convinced Cactus to go on the Phoenix with me, but <br/>
we ran out of tickets! So hopefully next year!<br/>
<br/>
It was great meeting so many nice 'new' letterboxers and seeing <br/>
familiar faces, <br/>
<br/>
Thanks again--<br/>
