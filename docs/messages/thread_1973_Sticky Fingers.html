<div>I hope VERY much that you won't let this sour you on boxing. That's a pretty rare occurence from what I've read and heard since I started boxing in spring of 2004. For what it's worth, I never include ink in a box, for no other reason than I don't want to have to think about it getting ruined, or replacing it....one less thing to replace. Most people don't include ink pads. </div>
