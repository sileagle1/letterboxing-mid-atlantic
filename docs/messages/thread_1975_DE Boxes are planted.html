missing!  2 were recarved (and you'll know which when you seek them out <br/>
cause my carving was not as good as the original image which I <br/>
copied).  However, I have high hopes of finding the 2nd since it <br/>
disappeared before I even planted it!  Guess it is time to clean house -<br/>
 UGH.  And the 3rd by PostMystress is too complicated to reproduce so <br/>
it will just be a TRAIL Call Number gimmee in the clues.<br/>
<br/>
Hopefully everyone planning to attend is signing up on AQ -- and you <br/>
should so I can email out the TRAIL playing card in advance.  Keep an <br/>
eye on the AQ Event Details for updates.  <br/>

Inspector Grogue is working hard on solving who the Body in the <br/>
Murderkill was - next article appears tomorrow (WED).<br/>
<br/>
Back to work on the clues.<br/>
