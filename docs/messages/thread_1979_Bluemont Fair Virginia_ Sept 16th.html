  I and the rest of "The End Gang" will be at the Bluemont Fair as <br/>
planned on Saturday, September 16th. Hikinghams will also be attending. <br/>
Bulldawg and his crew are also likely to attend, though not until later <br/>
in the day. I am meeting Hikinghams at 10:30 am at the EE Lake Store.<br/>
  Ditsyqouin has been busy and I am not sure she will be actually the <br/>
person doing the postal cancellation stamp. I have carved a fair stamp <br/>
but it is not planted yet. I will use Saturday as the day to plant and <br/>
will post the clues that evening. If you catch me at the fair, you may <br/>
stamp in before the plant, or I will tell you how to find it. The stamp <br/>
came out better than expected, so I will plan on leaving this as a <br/>
limited time box somewhere in Bluemont. It will remain out for one <br/>
year, at which time I will retire it and plant a new fair box for next <br/>
year. I am still playing with the time frame, so forgive me if I <br/>
suddenly pull it ( will give notice). Hope some more people are able to <br/>
come out. It looks to be a great wekend and the fair has lots to do.<br/>
