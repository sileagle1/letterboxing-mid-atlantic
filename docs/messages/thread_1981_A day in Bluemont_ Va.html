Fair today, but thanks to Koyote and his family for coming out and <br/>
setting it up.  Great to meet new faces and locals Hikinghams, and <br/>
Ditstquoin.  The fair was awesome as well.  After chatting with <br/>
Hikinghams about a local box by Gallant Rogue, I had to go get it.  <br/>
So the wife, 2 kids and I left about 1:30...went to Bear's Den..and <br/>
did Gallant Rogue's "Spirit"..which had been on my list for awhile.  <br/>
Nice hike, took longer than expected(2.25 hrs), but that was due to <br/>
kids and a few more breaks than normal.  "Spirit" is a great box.  <br/>
Awesome hike, and challenging...perfect for my needs..great stamp, <br/>
and got the opportunity to hike with 3 through-hikers for a bit on <br/>
their 3rd day of a week long hike, pretty cool.  The AT is a great <br/>
place.  I just left it with a sense of accomplishment, and was so <br/>
proud of my 2 young daughters for sticking through the long hike, <br/>
and the climb back.  Was one of those "dad" moments, teaching life <br/>
lessons, and toughness.  Thats what I take from "spirit"......its <br/>
not about the stamp, but that trip will always be with my family.  <br/>
Its not the count, but moments like this..thanks Rogue, Im a fan.<br/>
<br/>
For those thinking about doing it......do it..It tougher that 95% of <br/>
letterboxes but the feeling is worth it..I left a one of a kind <br/>
Hitch-Hiker that i finished this morning to get people out there. <br/>
Every time i hike the AT, i wonder why i am not on it more.  Who <br/>
knows, maybe I left another box out there today... ;)<br/>
<br/>
thanks for all those that made today a great family <br/>
day....especailly my wife, she is such a trooper..and always smiles.</div>

I'm speechless that BullDawg finally logged one of my boxes... since <br/>
I've stamped in to 25 of his!  :)<br/>
<br/>
Glad you enjoyed it... I've had a ton of fun hunting your!</div>
