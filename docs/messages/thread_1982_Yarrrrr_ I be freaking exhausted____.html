                    <div id="ygrps-yiv-1255850444"><div>Well Cyclonic, Dude the Wonder Dog and I left Philly at 4 AM yesterday to attend the Pirate from Every Port gather in Groton, CT. We had a lovely ride up with no traffic, Cyclonic took the beautiful Merritt Parkway rather than 95 and it was really nice to watch a gorgeous sunset come up over this lovely stretch of road.</div> <div> </div> <div>We get to the gather and I am very excited to see lot's of knew faces and who is one of the first people I run into in the parking lot? Our own Jan of Team Little Dog!! After a big hug and some catching up we both headed into the gather. I got to re-visit with some folks I have met before at other events. Lock Wench, Kreepy Kelli, Brandi You're a Fine Girl, Team Green Dragon, Phynstar, Wisconson Hiker and Martini Man, Wanda and Pete and some crazy broad that I keep running into everywhere I go. Let's see, what was her trail name again? Sowsew something....hmmmm. Also got to finally meet Dogs With Wings and visit
 with our own Scarab, Nightowl and Tuxie and former (and still current I suppose) LBMAer's Silent Doug and Clueless. I must say, the land of a million boxes does seem to be agreeing with them, they both looked great.</div> <div> </div> <div>It was noce to be able to put faces with trail names of people whose posts I have enjoyed over the years. Team Safari, Connfederate, CPA Scott, Donutz716, plus a lot of folks I hadn't heard of that were just so nice. Nittany is a transplanted Carlisle, Pa boxer who went to the same high school as my step daughter, she and her husband are both so friendly. So many other nice boxers, a couple of new ones who were having a blast. Finally met Sowsewbizzy's CT friends Butterfly and Lazyletterboxer. Bumped into that ol' curmudgeon Dr. Hawley T. Griffin who is actually quite charming. Caught up with my old friends Uneskia, Justice and Miles who I met on one of my New Hampshire trips, and got to meet and chat with the Pepes and
 Jay Drew which I thoroughly enjoyed. All lovely folks indeed. There are so many great moments and interactions that I know I am leaving out but Cyclonic dropped me off at 11:30 last night and it was a lo-o-ong day for this old broad. I am only up early because I promised my husband I would help him put together his campaign signs that he wants to put out today (what was I thinking?)</div> <div> </div> <div>Dude the Wonder Dog decided I was not spending enough quality time alone with him at the gather and broke into our pack and ate a bag of beef jerky, chewed his way into a jar of soy nut butter (allergic to peanuts...me, not him) and sucked that up, plus destroyed his bed. I think he got frustrated when he saw the day winding down and realized his mom brought him all the way to CT and we weren't even going to get one find!! It's true! I was laughing on the way home to Cyclonic when I said "Do you realize we drove all the way up here and are
 going home with not one find?" I mean, we had to swerve around the ones just laying in the roads for crying out loud! I stumbled across 3 getting from the car to the pavillion! Nah, just kidding. But we really don't have any CT finds. Which means we have to go back. But if he thinks I am getting up at #$%@! 3:30 AM again his out of his mind!</div> <div> </div> <div>The site was nice, the weather perfect and the food and the company just scrumptious!! Kelli and her gang really put together a nice event. A wonderful day with some great people. I'm glad Cyclonic suggested we go.</div> <div> </div> <div>Gotto go build signs, where did I see my hammer last? Dude probably ate that too.</div> <div> </div> <div>H&amp;H</div><p>

"it's a wonder that dog doesn't throw up all over the place"???<br/>

We were wondering why you didn't come, kinda disappointed, we figured <br/>
you would be there.  To think, a woman living in a city like NY worried <br/>
about the "crowds at a gathering.  ;-)<br/>

<br/>
What she said. <br/>
<br/>
With all the traveling LBoxers, especially the familiar LBMAers, it is <br/>
hard to feel like a stranger in a new place. Cy, H&amp;H, and SSB. Music <br/>
Woman, Kelli, and Brandy, have all been down here, so are familiar and <br/>
great to see again. And wonderful to see Silent and Clueless again. <br/>
<br/>
I sure know what H&amp;H means about not getting trail "boxes" while at the <br/>
gather. Night Owl had to drag me away from the tables, and didn't <br/>
succeed until the last minute. We ended up boxing with the box "pick <br/>
up" crew. At least we didn't get caught in the dark like some did. <br/>
<br/>
And yet I still didn't get to see everyone. Arghhhhh. And so <br/>
frustrating to meet new people you've wanted to meet for so long and <br/>
somehow still not get to talk to them much. But it was great. <br/>
<br/>
We drove back through PA this time instead of NJ-95. I really enjoyed <br/>
that route. We will get up to PA more, soon. <br/>
