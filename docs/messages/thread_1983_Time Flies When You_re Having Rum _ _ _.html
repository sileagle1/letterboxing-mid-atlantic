time and was floored to see HnH &amp; Cyclonic and then in rolls Scarab &amp; <br/>
Night Owl!!  I already knew Jan TLD would be making her way there.  I <br/>
followed the example set by HnH and just 'rested' at the gather tables <br/>
and probably got more stamps (table treats) than those that hit the <br/>
trails!  And although I missed most of the day only boxes, I did stamp <br/>
into all the perms TODAY - day late but much more relaxing.  6-1/2 <br/>
miles and are my feet sore!  There were some terrific stamps - not <br/>
some - LOTS.<br/>

Next stop Killens Pond!<br/>
