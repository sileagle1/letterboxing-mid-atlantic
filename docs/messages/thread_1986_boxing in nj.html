                    <div id="ygrps-yiv-985755342"><div>Well, several New Jerseyans now know about letterboxing, because of me.</div> <div> </div> <div>I was the only visitor at the Gabreil Daveis Tavern, and I had a wonderful time being shown over the house by the volunteer &amp; her two young granddaughters, while her husband read the paper downstairs.  Since no one else was around, they came outside with me too, showing me around the yard &amp; the spot where the last owner is buried--at which point I started getting antsy, because that was the start of the clues for the box. </div> <div> </div> <div> As we were chatting, she said "You know, there's a treasure hunting game where people hide rubber stamps, and we're supposed to have one here--but a couple came through a few months ago and we helped them look for it, and we think it's gone--we're pretty sure we found the tree it was supposed to be in."  (Rats! I thought, serves me right for coming out with clues that I printed off in
 January 2005.)  Since the cat was out of the bag, I said, "Well, actually that's why I'm here too, maybe I'll just check...."</div> <div> </div> <div>So we all trooped down the path, past the first couple of clues, and came to a HUGE recently downed tree.  At which point my new friends turned back. But I scrambled over &amp; kept going--came to another dead tree, scrambled over that one, couldn't find the next clue but picked up the one after it, and voila! found the box.  With a typically gorgeous D'n'A stamp.  Well, I thought, I should show this lady the stamp.  And then tell her NOT to tell anyone about it!</div> <div> </div> <div>When I got back to the house, the girls were gone &amp; there were 4 new visitors taking the tour.  The husband was relieved to see me, since they'd been wondering if they were going to have to call the police if I didn't show up again....  "Did you find it?" he asked.  So then I sat
 down with him &amp; showed him my logbook, &amp; we had a nice conversation; turns out he used to work in DE not far from me.</div> <div> </div> <div>And then my guide came down the stairs with her visitors.  "Oh, good, you're back!" she said; "DId you find it?"  So then I got to explain what letterboxing was all over again for the new people....  I did remind them that if they found the box (&amp; I didn't give them any hints, other than it seems that when they looked for it they didn't climb over the tree) they should rehide it &amp; not tell anyone about it!  </div><p>
