Another weird story, we were looking for another box but found the clues to Treson in the <br/>
Mt. Misery box. I had looked for this box awhile back, was sure I was in the right spot but no <br/>
box. Thought we give it one more try, Box was just whre I thought it would be, the same spot <br/>
I looked before. It seems a noxer had found the box and thought it was trash. They were <br/>
upset that anyone would leave anything in the woods. They left a long note in the box but I'm <br/>
still not sure how the box got back to it's hiding place. I f had been correctly hidden it should <br/>
not have been visible and it is fairly well off the trail.</div>

&gt; again.  This sounds <br/>
&gt; like something to go down in letterboxing lore, a<br/>
&gt; muggle finding a box <br/>
&gt; and leaving a nasty note in it about it being<br/>
&gt; litter.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; The original Mt. Misery box had a store bought stamp<br/>
&gt; of a shark in it. <br/>
&gt; It made no sense what so ever and when I first found<br/>
&gt; it I was <br/>
&gt; disappointed, but now, over the years, I have come<br/>
&gt; to think of it as <br/>
&gt; just one of those weird things that make<br/>
&gt; letterboxing interesting.<br/>
