I looked off inthe distance and saw a disturbing image, dark, menacing and with smoke coming out of it's ears! Frozen with fear I heard the apparition say "Ye best be puttin' me treasure back where t'belongs wench, or tis off w' yer dogs 'ead!" Well, that really got my Irish up, my middle aged hormones kicked in and I shouted "$%#^!!! @#$ E$@#$%!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!" (This is a family board so you'll just have to use your imagination) Anyway I chased his @$$ all over Neshaminy State Park and finally he just seemed to dissapate. But I feel he's is still lurking there, watching over what he mistakenly believes is "His" treasure! More details to follow on dot org soon!
