This is a fund raiser for shelter animals in Schwenksville, PA. You can sponsor us for any amount you like, even a dollar or two. Any letterboxer sponsoring us for $5 or more will get clues to a box we are planting especially for that event. If you are interested in sponsoring us please contact me OFF LIST for our mailing address. All monies have to be received by me by Sept. 29th. I then forward them to the event co-coordinators. The walk is Sunday, Oct. 15th along the Perkiomen Trail, which is where the box will be planted. Anyone interested in more information can check out the website at: <a href="http://www.animalwelfareproject.org/Barkpark2.htm" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.animalwelfareproject.org/Barkpark2.htm</a></div> <div> </div> <div>Also, anyone who wants to join us, or just bring their best friend up for the day to check out all the
 events is more than welcome!</div> <div> </div> <div>Hoping to hear from you soon,</div> <div> </div> <div>Irene and Dude - Hikers &amp; Hounds</div><p>
