Any suggestions for other boxes along the route (esp for the western <br/>

some boxes on the return trip as well, of course.<br/>

</span></blockquote>When are you planning on going?<br/>
<br/>
I am headed to Pittsburgh this weekend and hope to get a few boxes <br/>
whiole there, so I will tell you how they are.<br/>
<br/>
A few boxes that did not come up in your search are teh America's Super <br/>
Highway boxes, which are mysteries, and Govenour Dick in Mt Gretna.  The <br/>
later is an excellent box, very good hike with a great reward at the <br/>
end.  Mt Gretna is just off the Lebenon-Lancaster Exit of the Turnpike.<br/>
<br/>
Good luck, and I will let you know what I come up with in the Steel City.<br/>
