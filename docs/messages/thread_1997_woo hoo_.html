I want to nudge into a little limelight too, though, because I just<br/>
got to F500 today!  It was the Remnants of the Invasion, plus LB's own<br/>
Crop Circle Nexus, that got me there.<br/>
<br/>
I just checked my database, and no fewer than NINETY-ONE of my 505<br/>
finds were planted by Lightnin' Bug himself.  18% of my finds are from<br/>
that wonderful Allentonian.  Wow.  Thanks, friend!<br/>

milestone, it was nice of you to mention that my series had <br/>
something to do with it. i only have 6 boxes in the area so far and <br/>
was glad i could help. when we come back to invade your state again <br/>
next year, maybe we can help you reach another milestone. 1,000F <br/>
maybe.<br/>
<br/>
i look forward to our return to PA and hope to have more luck with <br/>
the invasion. we will not fail next time.<br/>
<br/>
planning has already begun!<br/>
