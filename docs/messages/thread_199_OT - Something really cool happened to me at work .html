<div>I am a software/soft skills trainer for a company in NE Philly. Some of the training I do is for the company new hires. I have been conducting a class of 10 newhires since 6/28 and today is their last day with me. We have a had a blast together and they have listened to me obsess with worry about the T-Shirts, the Gathering, etc. I've talked tons about letterboxing as there are several folks in my class who are pretty cool and I am always trying to recruit trail buddies. Well today they handed me a clue for something hidden in my classroom, which led to another clue and so one through 6 clues until I found the gift they bought me, a hiking bottle and a little stuffed "hound". (I will call him "mini-dude"). They said they wanted to plant a letter box for me but weren't quite sure how so they planted my gift. It was so cool! The clues me were taped under my flip chart, projector, desk, paper towel holder in the ladies room, etc. What a cool thing to do! And the
 clues were so well done I told them they are all now official members of Hikers &amp; Hounds and must join me on the trails. Just thought I would share...</div>
