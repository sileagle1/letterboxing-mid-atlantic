<br/>
I've frequented the LBNE site for awhile now but as I don't visit New <br/>
England often I can't quite relate to the clue sharing, stories, etc. <br/>
I thought that those of us in the Mid-Atlantic states would enjoy <br/>
such a place where we can share ideas, clues, and stories about <br/>
letterboxing in our own neck of the US. <br/>
<br/>
In case you haven't noticed, I have not included a database as part <br/>
of our group - it's too controversial a topic on LBNA and elsewhere. <br/>
It'd like this to remain as peaceful as possible without it starting <br/>
out in a name-calling fest over a database!<br/>
<br/>
So once again, welcome. Make of this what you will, and hopefully it <br/>
will be an enjoyable spot for Mid-Atlantic Letterboxers to stop in <br/>
and talk about LBing. <br/>

<br/>
I live in NY state but I'm interested in Mid-atlantic areas <br/>
also...my brother and his fiancee live in DC, my parents in NVA.    <br/>
I'm looking for a way to introduce this to them when we visit for <br/>
EAster week.  I have two girls ages 3 and 6, and we all love being <br/>
outdoors.  Sometimes we have a hard time finding activities that <br/>
span the generations...It seems like letterboxing could be an <br/>
activity we would all enjoy doing when we are done visiting all the <br/>
museums we can stand in DC!<br/>
<br/>
I'm also a Brownie troop leader and I'm exploring ways letterboxing <br/>
could be used to keep the girls busy in the out of doors...so many <br/>
of the traditional camp skills I learned as a girl seem quite <br/>
dangerous when 25 1st graders are involved!<br/>

then give them the details on the walk. I did that at Thanksgiving <br/>
with some extended family, and by the time we were ready to leave, 8 <br/>
people had piled/squished into my sister's little Volkswagon! <br/>
Everyone was very excited! I just looked at letterboxing.org and <br/>
there are plenty of LBs in DC, so you can just pick the ones that <br/>
appeal to you and are family friendly and off you go! :) Have fun!<br/>

I also wanted to share an update.  I went out to find the boxes in <br/>
Hartshorne woods park today.  I found the first five but couldn't <br/>
find the last one aka "Old Glory".  The other five boxes where in <br/>
good shape. I also went to look for the "Sandy Hook Lighthouse" box <br/>
but to my dismay I found that the Mt. Mitchell ScenicOverlook park <br/>
where the clues start is closed for renovations.  Just a heads up to <br/>
anyone who was thinking of going to look for it.  I'm not quite sure <br/>
of when its going to reopen.<br/>
