                    <div id="ygrps-yiv-612104936">Recently I've been seeking out the older boxes in the region. I've had <br/>
my eye on the "Rockburn Branch Trail" series of three, originally by <br/>
Go Against the Flow, then adopted by MD Orphan. They were placed in <br/>
Patapsco Valley SP in the Avalon section in Elkridge, MD.<br/>
<br/>
Hit the trail and couldn't find any of them; in fact, the landmarks <br/>
also seemed to be gone. The clues are more cryptic once you're on the <br/>
trail than they appear to be on paper; indeed the original placer gave <br/>
the boxes a rating of "moderate to difficult." I'd assumed this was an <br/>
indication of the difficulty of the hike, because of the very steep <br/>
and long start to the trail. But now I'm not so sure. Perhaps it is <br/>
the clues that are difficult.<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, long story short: This is a beautiful, but lightly used trail, <br/>
and so I am inclined to think that the boxes may still be there. LBNA <br/>
shows only "founds," with the last being in May 2005. I'll gladly hike <br/>
the trail and try again. But I'd appreciate communication offline with <br/>
folks who have found the boxes in the past, especially if you found <br/>
them rather recently. Just send me an email!<br/>

Many thanks, wood thrush</div>

                    <div id="ygrps-yiv-1545706190">Thanks Choi, this is a good start! I didn't realize MD Orphan had been <br/>
offline *themselves* for so long. They had adopted a fair number of <br/>
2002-2003-era boxes in Maryland.<br/>
<br/>
So, we've got historic 2002 boxes w/cryptic clues in a changed <br/>
environment. They had been adopted, but now the adopter has gone <br/>
missing as well. It's a good challenge.<br/>
<br/>
Anyone out there with more info? Box sightings?<br/>

missing, because I'm about 95% sure I was at the right spot and made a <br/>
thorough search when I was there. Boxes 1 and 2 were the ones where <br/>
the landmarks appeared to be gone and the clues were really cryptic, <br/>
so I didn't get a good attempt at those. I have a few theories, and I <br/>
am contacting the last finder, from May 2005. This detective work is <br/>
actually a lot of fun, so stay tuned, and if you've got some info, <br/>
send it along.<br/>
