Well, this is last minute, but we are deffinately having a little get<br/>
together party at my place this Saturday.  You can come anytime in the<br/>
afternoon, stay all night if you like.<br/>
<br/>
The address is 225A Mill Street, Bristol, Pa<br/>
<br/>
We have some parking out back, and there is a municipal lot just a block<br/>
away.<br/>
<br/>
It is also Bike Nite in Bristol, so the town should be hopping.<br/>
<br/>
If you bring anything, please bring a chair, we haven't many of our own.<br/>
   Also, an alcaholic beverage of your choice would be fine, though there<br/>
will be beer :-)<br/>
<br/>
So pass the word, everyone is welcome!<br/>
<br/>
PS: For those letterboxers out there, there will be a stamp involved.<br/>
