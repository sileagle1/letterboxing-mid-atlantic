to help Tommcat move and pick up some tires for a friend's Duce and a half.<br/>
<br/>
On the way out I found both of Flat Tire's boxes along the Turnpike, <br/>
which gave me some great ideas for planting some more micros of my own. <br/>
  Both were in fine shape and well worth the quick stop.<br/>
<br/>
Farmer Brown and I went hunting for a few over the weekend.<br/>
<br/>
First we found the "Mystery Animal Series #3" box in Moon park. <br/>
Honesty, it was a dissappointing hike with a store bought stamp at the <br/>
end.  Fine for kids though.<br/>
<br/>
We also headed to Frick Park to get a few.  The "East Ridge" box was <br/>
also a store bought, but the hike was nice and well worth it.  We got <br/>
the first two boxes of the "Pride of Pittsburgh" series, very nice <br/>
stamps.  We elected not to get the rest, which are in a different part <br/>
of the park, and instead got "Promenading Pooch", a store bought but <br/>
again a nice stamp.<br/>
<br/>
We skipped the rest of "Pride of Pittsburgh" to head to Kennywood, which <br/>
turned out to be closed, but that was just as well since the skies <br/>
opened up when we got there.<br/>
<br/>
I did some scouting around, found some places to plant later this year, <br/>
like down at Fort Pitt and Old Economy Village, so hopefully by December <br/>
Pittsburgh will have some new boxes.<br/>
<br/>
For the B's, I highly recommend "Pride of Pittsburgh"<br/>

finish that series up then as well as get the rest of the boxes in that <br/>
area.<br/>
<br/>
I already have plans for planting, hehehe, Pittsburgh will never be the <br/>
same.<br/>
