And with the interest in the Clue Series - and it's magnitude (24 <br/>
boxes)- it would be a good event 'theme' 'goal' 'challenge'.<br/>
Even if some folks have already started the series, they could be put <br/>
in charge of preping lunch %^)<br/>
The series involves 3 parks reached from different directions:<br/>
Rooms in Poor Farm Park - from North or West of Richmond<br/>
Weapons in Dorey Park - from East of Richmond<br/>
Suspects in Powhite Park - from South or West of Richmond<br/>
<br/>
Directions to Poor Farm Park are available at:<br/>

<br/>
                    DISTANCE DRIVE TIME<br/>
Dorey to Powhite     19.3 mi  23 min<br/>
Powhite to Poor Farm 24.5 mi  27 min<br/>
Poor Farm to Dorey   30.3 mi  35 min<br/>
<br/>
If we have a dozen or so folks interested - it will not do to have <br/>
them all in a congo line going box to box.<br/>
<br/>
SUGGESTION: we start at two or three parks and meet up at Powhite <br/>
(the most central)for lunch (or another nearby location with <br/>
pavillion).  This will require CELL PHONE links to report status.  <br/>
There will need to be a lead person for each park -- I volunteer for <br/>
POOR FARM (coming from the North, I am).  I need two volunteers with <br/>
cell phones for DOREY &amp; POWHITE.  You can email me off list sowbiz[at]<br/>
yahoo[dot]com.  Once the leads are established we will seek team <br/>
participants so there are at least 3 no more than 6 per park.<br/>
<br/>
I have no idea if all 24 boxes can be found in a day.  If folks want <br/>
to camp for a day and resume on Sunday - that is good for me (except <br/>
I'll be camping in my brother's guest rm).  But camping will not be <br/>
part of my expertise (i.e. that's not my job!)<br/>
