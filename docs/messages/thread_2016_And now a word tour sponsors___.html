Did you know 30 - 40,000 mixed breed dogs are put down each year in shelters? Your dontations will help build a shelter that will work with abandoned dogs (and other animals) to help them find thier place in the community as pets, working dogs, therapy dogs, police or drug dogs. Thanks to you my assistant mailed $335 in donations yesterday to the Animal Welfare Project for "Bark in the Park" along with our registration form for the event. We will be there on the 15th walking the trail and meeting new friends, plus planting our Thank You box for our sponsors. Clues will be given to you after that date. Thanks again!</div> <div> </div> <div>DWD</div><p>
