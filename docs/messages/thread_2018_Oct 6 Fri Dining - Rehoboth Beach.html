<p><font size="2">Oct 6-8 is also the <i>Greyhounds Reach the Beach</i> and last year the town was more crowded than it was this past weekend</font><font face="Times New Roman">.</font></p><font face="Geneva,Arial">
<p>Each Columbus Day weekend, a miraculous transformation occurs in the resort communities of Dewey Beach and Rehoboth Beach, Delaware. The tropical summer wear of their typical visitors is replaced with greyhound t-shirts and sweatshirts. And around most every corner, peering out of nearly every car and hotel window, and lining the long, pristine beaches are greyhounds, greyhounds, and more beautiful greyhounds. <br/>More than 3,500 of these sleek and gentle dogs are expected to fill every dog-friendly crevice in the Delaware shore communities. The annual phenomenon, formally known as Greyhounds Reach the Beach, now attracts even non-dog lovers who flock to the area to view the sea of hounds.</p></font></div>
