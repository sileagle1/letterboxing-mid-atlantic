Note that the boxes at the pavilion park have been posted twice - once <br/>
under placer "DE Games" to comply with the state park application and <br/>
again under placer "sewsowbizzy" with links to Tripod  site.  Please <br/>
post your finds under sewsowbizzy's boxes - which also follow the <br/>
titles used on Tripod.<br/>
<br/>
I cannot post to AQ until after the gather because there are multiple <br/>
series with multiple carvers.  So each box will need to be listed <br/>
individually - but several will link to the same Tripod clue.<br/>

<br/>
I had posted (late in the day) on AQ Event details that the School <br/>
Bus got mowed and TLD retrieved the shreds of what was left.  Go to <br/>
AQ for TRAIL info/action.<br/>
<br/>
Without giving away the location of the box "M*D*" it is now noted <br/>
that it is not an after dark box to get.  But I feel good that you <br/>
found it!!  Glad I got permission to plant it so they at least know <br/>
folks will be poking around.  That is not always the case with other <br/>
boxes.<br/>
<br/>
As for the SailBoat - I thought those boxes were water tight (can't <br/>
remember if it was Dougerware or LnL).  Guess I should have checked <br/>
the high tide tables BEFORE I went a plantin'<br/>
<br/>
I never said I was good at planting boxes - so of the possible 77 <br/>
stamps planted, 2 were MIA &amp; were recarved, 1 MIA (Bird &amp; Flower)<br/>
eliminated from RoadTrip, and now 1 mowed (School Bus).<br/>
<br/>
Appreciate any other sit reps -- but don't give away the locations if <br/>
it is a mystery or the name of the box if it is a MonyLoop or <br/>
exCLUsion.  Best to list the clue title and which box in the series. <br/>

&gt; First, the bad news.  The owners of the property where the Western <br/>
Maryland box is busted me retrieving the box after dusk and asked <br/>
that searching be limited to daylight hours.  They are very nice <br/>
people but apparently there have been break-ins in the neighborhood.<br/>
&gt;    <br/>
&gt;   I wondered where that school bus was.  I didn't see a trace of it.<br/>
&gt;    <br/>
&gt;   Now, the better news.  Although I poured about a cup of water out <br/>
of the sailboat box at the boat ramp near Mispillion, the bags held <br/>
and I added a freezer bag inside the box over all the others.  It <br/>
looks like there's been high water lately.<br/>
&gt;    <br/>
&gt;   Now, the really good news.  All of the other boxes I found were <br/>
in good shape, though you probably gathered that from TLD's report.<br/>
