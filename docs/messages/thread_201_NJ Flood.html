1000 year storm of '04?  I was in N.E. PA for a family wedding over <br/>
the weekend and drove home Monday evening. MY aprox. 2 1/2 hour trip <br/>
took over 4, poor visibility, rain heavy at times, reduced speed <br/>
limit on turnpike. The drive from the turnpike to my house should <br/>
take 15 to 20 minutes and lasted for over 2 hours. Had to take one <br/>
detour and turn around and try another way at road closings three <br/>
times. I drove through some scary flooded intersections. When I <br/>
finally got home, I couldn't get 'home'.                             <br/>
<br/>
I live on a dead end street and the intersection closest to my home <br/>
was flooded too. I tried to drive in but had to stop when the car <br/>
started making nasty gurgling noises and threatened to drown. <br/>
Luckily, I was able to back out of that mess and park a couple of <br/>
blocks away. I lost my cell phone recently, so my son cut through <br/>
yards and waded knee deep water to go to the house and tell my <br/>
husband to go and pick me up in his big pickup. Except dad wasn't at <br/>
home. A couple of people walking by asked if they could help but they <br/>
didn't have phones either. Pretty weird for this area. Finally, a <br/>
guy, a driver stopped and let me use his phone, but Hubby's not <br/>
answering the cell. I guess my plan B and plan C sounded pretty thin <br/>
to this man so he offered to give my son and me as well as another <br/>
woman from the neighborhood a ride in his really big SUV. He took me <br/>
right to the door which I appreciated because most of my front yard <br/>
was flooded. Turns out that he is a retired volunteer fireman from <br/>
the area and I promptly forgot his name when I got into the house and <br/>
shut the door. Bummer!<br/>
<br/>
PS Hubby was fine. He didn't think that I was coming home till the <br/>
next day and went out with his friends. He got my voice mail and said <br/>
that he'd be right home, 15 minutes. HA! Took an hour.<br/>
<br/>
Hmmm. This sounds like a stamp to me. Maybe a HH. <br/>

so we were ok.  Thanks to the sump pump the basement's<br/>
not even flooded.  Really, only the morning commute<br/>
the next day was significantly damaged.  <br/>
<br/>
Anyway, my heart goes out to everyone who DID have<br/>
flooding.  It's got to be one of the worst things<br/>
ever.  <br/>

P.S. I guess I'll have to check my boxes for flooding<br/>
damage, too...<br/>

<br/>
Luckily where we live in Moorestown we are elevated high enough on <br/>
the water table that we would only get flooded out if other homes <br/>
were completey under water.  Which is a SAD way to explain things, <br/>
but that was a major factor in deciding where to purchase our house.  <br/>
<br/>
I am completely thankful that the sump pump was a trooper and did not <br/>
fail us.  It went off every 25-30 seconds but it did not quite. :)  <br/>
We did get about 3" water in the basement a few years ago because one <br/>
sump pump failed and that was not fun!!  So I can imagine what others <br/>
down south Jersey are going through.  My heart truely goes out to <br/>
them.  <br/>
<br/>
Glad to hear you finally made it home.  A few extra hours spent <br/>
getting home is truelly worth getting home safe and finding your <br/>
house is ok.<br/>
<br/>
I can't get to check on my boxes til maybe mid next week so if anyone <br/>
finds one of mine missing or soaked please let me know and I will <br/>
make replacement boxes as soon as I can.<br/>
<br/>
That HH idea sounds pretty cool.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for your concern Gillian.  Glad to hear your ok.<br/>
<br/>
