Thanks for the well wishes; three more months, then mapsurfing here we come (that is if <br/>
there are any left for us normal mortals..). Thanks for the information on some of the "drive-<br/>
by's", it is particularly helpful.  Although, I should be scared to head up to PA, as the 'Bug is <br/>
showing his schizophrenic tendencies. ;)<br/>
