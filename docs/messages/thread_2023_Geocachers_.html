My first reaction was along the lines of, "What the &amp;*()%#?  We were <br/>
here first.  Find your own darn hiding spot!"<br/>
<br/>
Then I looked into Jamestown 2007 and it is a huge big deal.  And I <br/>
have to give them credit for not trashing our box without letting me <br/>
know.  <br/>
<br/>
Problem is, I pretty much have the only hiding spot in that location, <br/>
at least as far as I can remember.  And can I really trust them to <br/>
hide my box as well as I did?  I am leaning towards just pulling it, <br/>
but it was a decent little box in a box-less area.<br/>

Thoughts, please?<br/>

I would leave your LB where tis  - in fact I had a geocacher plant <br/>
near one of my boxes and then kept me informed when the floods washed <br/>
both our treasures away!<br/>
<br/>
As previously mentioned - LABEL it NOT GEOCACHE<br/>
<br/>
and they might label theirs accordingly - NOT LETTERBOX.<br/>

But I'd concentrate on DE Clues first!<br/>

<div>I'm with the rest of the responses on this subject. Your box was there 
first, therefore, the G-cacher can find another spot. There was another thread 
along this line somewhere in which the opposite had happened. The Cacher was 
less than curtious and made it very clear that his cache was there first and 
wanted the LB moved. Sharing the spot is an option, but your call. Safe 
trails.</div>

                    <div id="ygrps-yiv-1309735447">Hi there,<br/>
<br/>
I live here in the middle of Colonial history-land (Jamestown,<br/>
Williamsburg, Yorktown), and I can attest that the 2007 event is the<br/>
hugest tourist deal that has gone on down here since the bicentennial.<br/>
 The planning has been going on for years, and there are associated<br/>
events happening already.<br/>
<br/>
I agree with the phone call suggestion. But realistically, if your box<br/>
is left anywhere near where their cache is going to be, it probably<br/>
won't survive.  Letterboxes can to fall prey to geocachers even in the<br/>
best of circumstances, imagine what will happen with a bunch of<br/>
tourists for whom this is their geocache introduction.<br/>
<br/>
If you decide you want to move it, or relabel it or something, and I<br/>
can help, let me know. (though you'd have to send me the clues, I<br/>
looked through the VA mystery listings and I confess I haven't been<br/>
able to determine which box this might be)<br/>

&gt; I would suggest in your response to the geocacher(s) that you try to<br/>
set up a phone call.  Frequently warmth and tone are not captured in<br/>
written communication; i.e., you're more likely to persuade them on<br/>
the phone.  Their tone is absolutely awful in writing and perhaps they<br/>
didn't mean for it to come out that way.<br/>
&gt;    <br/>
&gt;   Without letting on what you are trying to find out, try to<br/>
determine whether or not this is:<br/>
&gt;    <br/>
&gt;   "Nice letterbox.  Shame if anything happened to it." or<br/>
&gt;    <br/>
&gt;   "We are the official Jamestown 2007 committee and [are<br/>
planning]/[have been planning for several months] a geocache event in<br/>
connection with our festivals and we suspect a lot of inexperienced<br/>
cachers may damage your letterbox.  Heads up."  or<br/>
&gt;    <br/>
&gt;   "I'm involved in Jamestown 2007 and also wanted to plant a<br/>
geocache and your letterbox is near the spot I just scouted out."<br/>
&gt;    <br/>
&gt;   Your response may be different depending on context.  QOCMike is<br/>
active on Atlas Quest and does both letterboxing and geocaching.  He<br/>
may also have some insight.<br/>

&gt; <br/>
&gt; "Message: <br/>
&gt; Our Jamestown 2007 committee came across your letterbox this past <br/>

&gt; My first reaction was along the lines of, "What the &amp;*()%#? We were <br/>
&gt; here first. Find your own darn hiding spot!"<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Then I looked into Jamestown 2007 and it is a huge big deal. And I <br/>
&gt; have to give them credit for not trashing our box without letting me <br/>
&gt; know. <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Problem is, I pretty much have the only hiding spot in that location, <br/>
&gt; at least as far as I can remember. And can I really trust them to <br/>
&gt; hide my box as well as I did? I am leaning towards just pulling it, <br/>
&gt; but it was a decent little box in a box-less area.<br/>

&gt; Thoughts, please?<br/>

<div>I wouldn't give them MUCH credit--seems to me you'd have to be pretty 
  rude to just trash somebody else's stuff, cacher or boxer.  I'm with 
  Geckospot--you were there first, if they can live with being near your box 
  fine, if not let THEM find another spot.</div>
<div>("Would you like us to move your box, that would be less intrusive" 
  indeed!)</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Apparently they have found another hiding spot than yours, since the box 
  is only "in very close proximity."  Certainly they can post in their 
  clues that there is a letterbox nearby, and you can label the box "THIS IS NOT 
  THE GEOCACHE, KEEP LOOKING"....</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Wonder what the geocaching response would be if a letterboxer asked for 
  an established cache to be moved because they were planning to put a letterbox 
  there next year?</div>
