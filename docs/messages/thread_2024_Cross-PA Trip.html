                    <div id="ygrps-yiv-1382941428">We dealt with the ginormous car show in Carlisle, buckets of rain <br/>
and construction and accidents, 400 miles each way, and in the <br/>
middle of it all managed to letterbox.  Nothing stands in the way of <br/>
priorities!<br/>
<br/>
After the Peter J. Camiel rest stop (great stamp), we intended a <br/>
quick on and off in Carlisle but were stopped dead in our tracks by <br/>
the car show.  We still managed to pick up RGBisme's wonderful "Mary <br/>
McCauly" (enjoyed the surroundings greatly) and Pointer Party's "NH <br/>
Lady Slipper Finds a Home in PA."  The latter featured a stamp <br/>
carved by Uneksia that is truly stunning.  Don't forget your markers <br/>
for that one.<br/>
<br/>
Then on and on and on the PA TP -- a brief stop at Somerset to walk <br/>
the dog, then out to Zelienople.  The rain was coming down pretty <br/>
hard so we chose drive-bys.  We were not disappointed with the <br/>
Harmonist Cemetary.  One of the most unique places we have ever been <br/>
taken lbing, even in the rain.<br/>
<br/>
Onto family in OH, and our mystery box planted.  I hope to get the <br/>
clues up later today.  It is dedicated to my aunt, who is currently <br/>
battling cancer, and she is very excited about the box.  She can't <br/>
wait until it gets visitors -- unbeknownst to her, I am going to ask <br/>
visitors to leave her a note as well.  The clues are going to be <br/>
pretty easy as a result but it was great (and a great surprise) to <br/>
see her so full of anticipation.  I might even have to post a <br/>
spoiler on the Great Lakes List to get someone out there soon!<br/>
<br/>
Back and back again, with just a quick stop in Beaver Falls for a <br/>
couple of almost drive-bys in pretty spots.  But our thoughts were <br/>
turning to preparation for the DE games, and we worked on making <br/>
good time home.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for all the suggestions, to those who sent them to me.  We <br/>
are planning several more trips out Harrisburg/Lancaster way to pick <br/>
up all the neat boxes there.  In the meantime, I am working <br/>
feverishly to get us turned around in time to head south this time.  <br/>
See some of you in a few days, jars of pickles in hand.<br/>
