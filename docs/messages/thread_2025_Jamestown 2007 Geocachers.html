<br/>
Except in this case, I suspect that The B's placed this one without persmission of any type and now the LANDOWNER wants to use the spot as a geocache location. That's going to be a tough one to argue with. They can do almost anything they want with the letterbox at this point.<br/>
<br/>
Possible solutions/compromises:<br/>
<br/>
The stamp would work well with a historic theme. Perhaps you can let them convert the letterbox into a hybrid of some sort, or otherwise incorporate your letterbox into whatever they are planning. That would mean spoiling the mystery, but you'd still be in the spot that you selected. And your stamp would get a wider audience.<br/>
<br/>
There is a park about two miles east of your spot that has two caches with plenty of room for your letterbox. The stamp would still work there, since the park is posted as being in the town that you carved onto your stamp. It would be a completely different type of hide, with a totally new clue required, but it would still be fun. Maybe even more fun for some, since you would get to search without the audience found in the windows of a neighboring restaurant.<br/>
<br/>
I pass through the relevant area about once a month, so if I can help out in some way, let me know. There is only one letterbox in that region planted by someone other than yourself (my new hybrid about 20 miles south), so we definitely want to keep it around.<br/>
<br/>
Also, can you forward some contact information for this committee? I haven't heard anything of this in the local geocachers' group and if there is going to be a series of caches for this event (it is huge, it's been the tourism focus down here for the past couple of years already with the main events still to come), we'd like to know and probably offer some help. Or at least defend ourselves when they start finding caches in other spots that they want to use.<br/>

"Our Jamestown 2007 committee came across your letterbox this past <br/>
Friday. It is in very close proximity to our geocache location for <br/>
2007. It is in fine condition and we enjoyed looking at your stamp of <br/>
***. Our geocache goes on line January 1st., and we did not know if <br/>
you would like us to move your letterbox somewhere else on ***, that <br/>
would be less obtrusive. Please e me any time. Thanks."<br/>
<br/>
Problem is, I pretty much have the only hiding spot in that location, <br/>
at least as far as I can remember. And can I really trust them to <br/>
hide my box as well as I did? I am leaning towards just pulling it, <br/>
but it was a decent little box in a box-less area.</div>

Pull it by the end of 2006 and put it back in 2008.  Annotate LB.org <br/>
that it is on vacation for a year.  <br/>
<br/>
OR you could put out a NEWBIE LetterBox -- explaining the difference <br/>
between LB and GC and what a GC should do when an LB is found.  That <br/>
way you could hold your spot, not post any clues, and put the mystery <br/>
back in 2008.<br/>
<br/>
That was nice of the Committee to come back and elaborate.<br/>

Jamestown 2007 thing is bigger than a local geocacher wanting to place <br/>

the contact information for the Jamestown 2007 group and take you up <br/>
on your offer of help.<br/>
