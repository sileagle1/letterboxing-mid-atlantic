A COASTAL FLOOD WATCH REMAINS IN EFFECT FROM FRIDAY EVENING THROUGH <br/>
LATE SATURDAY NIGHT.<br/>
<br/>

TIDAL FLOODING WILL OCCUR DURING TIMES OF HIGH TIDE ALONG THE <br/>

DELAWARE BAY AND RARITAN BAY STARTING FRIDAY EVENING AND LASTING <br/>

MODERATE TO SEVERE BEACH EROSION.<br/>
<br/>
THE COMBINATION OF HIGH ASTRONOMICAL TIDES, DUE TO THE FULL MOON, <br/>
AND AN EXPECTED STRONG NORTHEAST WIND MAY GENERATE HIGH TIDES IN <br/>
EXCESS OF 7.5 FEET ABOVE MEAN LOWER LOW WATER. <br/>
<br/>
