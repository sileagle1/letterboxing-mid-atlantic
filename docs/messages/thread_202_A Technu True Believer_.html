I love the disclaimer! lol Glad to hear that the Technu works so <br/>
well, however. Not long ago my husband got something that looked an <br/>
awful lot like poison ivy reaction after working in out yard. I still <br/>
can't find the poison ivy but I'll be waiting with the Technu next <br/>
time.<br/>
