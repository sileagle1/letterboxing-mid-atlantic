This was a big surprise since the car was in the shop about a week ago to replace the very same battery and cables! Hmmm...so now I'm thinking the mechanic may have gotten it wrong, or coincidentally the alternator went right after the battery. Anyway, called good ol' triple a and got towed back home, car at the garage. Which I don't think is open tomorrow. So looks like no DE gather for us. Mr Irene needs his vehicle all weekend. Only a few weeks 'til election day and his still has lots of door knocking to do. Have a great time all and I'm very disappointed that we won't be there. But I am grateful we got towed home due to something easily reparable and nothing major, like an accident or something.
