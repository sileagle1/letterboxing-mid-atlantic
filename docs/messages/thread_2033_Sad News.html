&gt; Oh my goodness!  How terrible.  I have never met Sheba, so I didn't <br/>
&gt; realize how young her daughter was until I read the article.  How <br/>

sorry <br/>

called me Saturday afternoon with the news.  She was in tears over the <br/>
phone, and I thought it was Dude.  Nothing could have prepared me for <br/>
the shock of this sad news.<br/>
<br/>
It breaks my heart to hear of Laura.  She was such a beautiful person, <br/>
full of life.  She was the type of person that marched to her own beat, <br/>
very independent, and growing into her own being.  She was like a <br/>
blooming flower, wonderfully different, strong willed and bright.<br/>
<br/>
It truly is not fair to Suzanne and her family to have Laura ripped from <br/>
their lives.  Sue, who if you don't know her, is such a smart, cheerful, <br/>
kind and loving woman.  Every time you meet her she has a smile on her <br/>
face.  For this to happen seems unreal.<br/>
<br/>
Those who know me know that I am not usually a very emotional person, <br/>
but when we stopped on Saturday, all I wanted to do was hold her, tell <br/>
her how much I loved her, tell her how much she and Laura meant to me, <br/>
to us as a family, because we all have truly become a family.  I ended <br/>
up being totally speechless, letting the moment speak for itself.<br/>
<br/>
So Suzanne, I just want you to know that you and Laura are in my heart, <br/>
that anything I can do for you is considered done.  You have family <br/>
here, and we are with you and will forever cherish the memories of Laura.<br/>

things like that, remember the DeathMoose and killer monkeys, the fun <br/>

&gt; the <br/>
&gt; &gt; phone, and I thought it was Dude.  Nothing could<br/>
&gt; have prepared me <br/>
&gt; for <br/>
&gt; &gt; the shock of this sad news.<br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; It breaks my heart to hear of Laura.  She was such<br/>
&gt; a beautiful <br/>
&gt; person, <br/>
&gt; &gt; full of life.  She was the type of person that<br/>
&gt; marched to her own <br/>
&gt; beat, <br/>
&gt; &gt; very independent, and growing into her own being. <br/>
&gt; She was like a <br/>
&gt; &gt; blooming flower, wonderfully different, strong<br/>
&gt; willed and bright.<br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; It truly is not fair to Suzanne and her family to<br/>
&gt; have Laura ripped <br/>
&gt; from <br/>
&gt; &gt; their lives.  Sue, who if you don't know her, is<br/>
&gt; such a smart, <br/>
&gt; cheerful, <br/>
&gt; &gt; kind and loving woman.  Every time you meet her<br/>
&gt; she has a smile on <br/>
&gt; her <br/>
&gt; &gt; face.  For this to happen seems unreal.<br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; Those who know me know that I am not usually a<br/>
&gt; very emotional <br/>
&gt; person, <br/>
&gt; &gt; but when we stopped on Saturday, all I wanted to<br/>
&gt; do was hold her, <br/>
&gt; tell <br/>
&gt; &gt; her how much I loved her, tell her how much she<br/>
&gt; and Laura meant to <br/>
&gt; me, <br/>
&gt; &gt; to us as a family, because we all have truly<br/>
&gt; become a family.  I <br/>
&gt; ended <br/>
&gt; &gt; up being totally speechless, letting the moment<br/>
&gt; speak for itself.<br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; So Suzanne, I just want you to know that you and<br/>
&gt; Laura are in my <br/>
&gt; heart, <br/>
&gt; &gt; that anything I can do for you is considered done.<br/>
&gt;  You have family <br/>
&gt; &gt; here, and we are with you and will forever cherish<br/>
&gt; the memories of <br/>
&gt; Laura.<br/>
