She talked smack just like the rest of us idiots when the Road Rally was coming to town, but never inappropriately or in a mean way, just in the spirit of the games. And she was funny!!! I used to crack up at the way she teased her mom Sheba online. I remember I never saw a little girl who loved to get dirty as much as her. At the first Knoebles Gathering she played in the stones, and dirt, and sticks, and water. She loved Dude and walked him within an inch of his life! and he loved her too. When Cyclonic, Sheba, Deathmoose and I went after a Mapsurfer box, she was the most enthusiastic of all of us. Climbing under branches and through the mud and shouted "Biggaren!!" along with the rest of us when we actually found the damn thing! We would not have found that box without her. I remember being on our way to Canada as the Red Hat Boxers when Sheba gets a call that Death
 Moose got bit by a snake she was trying to rescue. I laughed out loud when she showed up at Campin' &amp; Stampin' with her eyes painted two different colors, one purple and one blue I think. I assumed she was just entering her "Goth" phase which her elder siblings have been enjoying the last couple of years and looked forward to seeing what colors she would soon begin dying her hair (I had been getting Sheba's updates about Eric and Sara over the last couple of years "Well, this week on one the hair is green and the other is orange"). But while she, like younger sisters everywhere, emulated her older siblings in some ways, she was true to herself. She had her won interests, several of which she shared with her mom. And I was so happy that Sheba embraced her childrens exploration of self. I was having so much fun watching Laura/Cow Smart/DeathMoose going through her many changes. She was such a great trail buddy, such a fun and
 unique member of this community. She dared to be different at an age when many kids do everything they can to try to fit into whatever is considered "the norm". I commend Sheba on raising such a child, and allowing her to be herself. Not Sheba's expectations of what she should be. Her unique, funny, multi-colored self. I will miss her many faces, trail names, wacky sig stamps and bright colors. My trails will now be so much more boring without her on them with me. I am heartbroken beyond words.

                    <div id="ygrps-yiv-1480153715">She sounds like a special young lady. I don't remember meeting her, but<br/>
sometimes all the people you see at gatherings can be kind of a blur until<br/>
you see them a few times and get to know them. I think I would have liked<br/>
her. Girls her age can be difficult to like sometimes. It's a difficult<br/>
age, as I'm sure the parents here can attest to. But it sounds like she was<br/>
a wonderful exception. And it's always lovely to see someone her age enjoy<br/>
sharing a hobby with her mother when lots of 12 year olds don't even want<br/>
to be in the same room with their parents. <br/>
<br/>
I don't know Sheba really well, but always enjoy seeing her at gatherings<br/>
and we spent the afternoon boxing together at Kingston. She and I seem to<br/>
share a similar sense of humor and I really enjoyed spending that time with<br/>
her. We got back so late, everything was all packed up and the people who<br/>
were staying overnight on the boat had already gone over there. It was a<br/>
good afternoon spent with good company. <br/>
<br/>
I'm sure knowing that everyone here is thinking about her is helping her<br/>
get through this. <br/>
<br/>
I had a suspicion Cyclonic could be nice. <br/>

She dared to be different at an age when many kids do
 everything they can to try to fit into whatever is considered "the norm". I commend Sheba on raising such a child, and allowing her to be herself. Not Sheba's expectations of what she should be. Her unique, funny, multi-colored self. I will miss her many faces, trail names, wacky sig stamps and bright colors. My trails will now be so much more boring without her on them with me. I am heartbroken beyond words. We have all suffered a great loss.</div> <div> </div> <div>H&amp;H      </div> <div> <hr size="1"/>  Talk is cheap. Use Yahoo!
