of the best to be found. There was a wide variety of<br/>
box types unfortunatley no major elevation gains in<br/>
the hikes. Next time contact DNREC and have some hills<br/>
brought in. Just kidding, if anyone could talk them<br/>
into it would be Judy.<br/>
Chili and burgers were great, must get recipe for<br/>
chili.<br/>

</span></blockquote>I was thinking the same thing at work last night.<br/>
<br/>
Judy, thanks, you crazy old woman, you put on a great show.  I don't <br/>
know how she found all the time to put in all the work she did for this <br/>
gathering, but then I remember, she is retired ;-)<br/>
<br/>
It was great to see so many new faces, and of coarse the old reliables.<br/>
<br/>
Erinn and I took the now nationally famous Dude (with sunglasses and <br/>
all) out on the trail for a few boxes, totally wearing him out for the <br/>
ride home.  I even managed to get some disc golf in, though I still suck.<br/>
<br/>
So, thanks again Judy, and hope to see you all (I'd better see you all) <br/>
at Boxtoberfest.<br/>
