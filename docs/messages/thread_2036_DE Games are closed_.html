More pics have been posted to AQ and the winners are listed under the <br/>
Blue Button.  Even with my attempt to stand guard at the Event Log <br/>
and learn names/faces Â– I still blew it.  I think it was the party of <br/>
5 called The B's that left me confused.  I'm thinking the 2B's were <br/>
the grill myster and wife, but not sure about rest of family.  Please <br/>
email me off list to correct my AQ photos.  Also, Dalphinus need to <br/>
know which is Carl and the kids trail names.<br/>
<br/>
I will try to find time next week to post the boxes to AQ - although <br/>
I may cheat and not post the clues!  In order to give carving credit <br/>
to the boxes they have to be listed individually.  But the clues do <br/>
not lend themselves to being broken apart.  Each box will have the <br/>
same link to DE Clues (Tripod) and non-gather folks will  just have <br/>
to figure them out.  Will need to update clues for the missing boxes <br/>
though.<br/>
<br/>
The Dining Around restaurant boxes will be placed in their proper <br/>
locations by the end of Oct. And the REAL DogFish Head may end up at <br/>
the brewery.  Will also get Sushi and Julia planted.<br/>

WI Hiker reported that the Sail Boat at the boat launch has <br/>
resurfaced and she dried it out.<br/>
<br/>
After the gather Dalphinus et al were the First Finders for WV <br/>
Licence Plate and the TopsyTurvey Wedding Cake at Killen's Pond.  I <br/>
was surprised no one had questioned me about that clue "a tree beFOUR <br/>
and AFTER 50 steps". <br/>
<br/>
Thanks again everyone, and NO there will not be a DE GAMES II - <br/>
unless someone else wants to grab the baton.<br/>

                    <div id="ygrps-yiv-235128512">A belated THANK YOU to Sewsowbizzy and everyone at the gather.  We <br/>
had a great time getting as many boxes as we could on Sat, with the <br/>
highlight being our crabcake brunch at Sambo's.  The stamps were <br/>
amazing, we saw some really neat parts of DE, and we had a great <br/>
time putting faces to names, though I know I missed quite a few.  <br/>
SSB did an incredible amount of work, which was a constant theme of <br/>
our comments throughout the weekend.<br/>
<br/>
We spent Monday doing a little clean-up boxing while the trailer was <br/>
drying out.  Managed to pick up the rest of the restaurants, and the <br/>
sandwich shop stamp.  Glad to hear the submerged stamp was OK!<br/>
<br/>
Still didn't get a few in Killens Pond Park.  One of the Bs wanted <br/>
to ask about the "tree beFOUR and AFter clue" but we thought that <br/>
was bad form.<br/>
<br/>
Oh -- and the Bs were Queen B and her two sons (there's another one, <br/>
but his brothers made me leave him at home so he didn't slow them <br/>
down; he'll be at Boxtoberfest, though).  My parents, including my <br/>
dad who was manning the grill, use the trail name "2 Cooks" but <br/>
joined our team for this event.<br/>
<br/>
Sorry this thank you post is so delayed.  I spent today going to <br/>
doctors and getting my hand X-rayed as I might have broken it -- <br/>
jury is still out, so I have it splinted for now.  (But not just now <br/>
as I can't type with the splint on.)  Yes, I did injure it while <br/>
boxing... my husband won't be letting me live this down anytime soon.<br/>

The B with the blue shirt is Barn Cat (aka b#2).<br/>
<br/>
The B with the brown shirt is sheep/dog (aka b#1).<br/>
<br/>
Both are eagerly awaiting their next gather, thanks to the kindness <br/>
shown to them by the folks in DE.<br/>
<br/>
Cyclonic, I have no idea why they were so captivated with meeting <br/>
you.  Ever since they saw your first stamp, you have had some sort <br/>
of aura around your name -- maybe because they are fellow roller <br/>
coaster enthusiasts?  They were almost afraid to introduce <br/>
themselves to you, but don't go getting a big head or anything <br/>
because of that.<br/>
<br/>
Very much looking forward to seeing you all again in two weeks.  <br/>
sheep/dog is already working on a new PT as he thought the clues for <br/>
the old one were much too easy. <br/>

<p class="ygrps-yiv-1042246264MsoNormal" style="MARGIN:0in 0in 0pt;">We also want to express our 
thanks to SewSowBizzy for organizing the most elaborate and enjoyable event we 
have attended!<span style="">Â  </span>Not only did we have 
an opportunity to explore two counties in Delaware, but we also had the 
excitement of discovering what else would be in the box in addition to a finely 
carved stamp.<span style="">Â  </span>Would it be a Poker 
card, a Scrabble tile, a Bingo sticker, a monetary value for the Monopoly game, 
or some other special thing?<span style="">Â  
</span>Sometimes it was more than one of the above and we enjoyed the Â“thrill of 
victory or the agony of defeatÂ” depending on whether it was something we needed 
or not.<span style="">Â  </span>The clues that led us to 
the boxes were also very creative, adding yet another layer of fun.<span style="">Â  </span>It was obvious that she spent a LOT of 
time preparing for this amazing event.</p>
<p class="ygrps-yiv-1042246264MsoNormal" style="MARGIN:0in 0in 0pt;">Â 
</p>
<p class="ygrps-yiv-1042246264MsoNormal" style="MARGIN:0in 0in 0pt;">A summary of our whirlwind visit 
to Delaware:</p>
<p class="ygrps-yiv-1042246264MsoNormal" style="MARGIN:0in 0in 0pt;">Â </p>
<p class="ygrps-yiv-1042246264MsoNormal" style="MARGIN:0in 0in 0pt;">Martini Man &amp; I arrived at 
the Baltimore airport Thursday evening and after a stop for our favorite crab 
cakes near the airport, we were on the road to Dover.<span style="">Â  </span>It soon started raining but we figured 
it was OK to rain at night since maybe that meant it would be done by 
morning.<span style="">Â  </span>WRONG!<span style="">Â  </span>When we woke on Friday morning we looked 
out our hotel window to see steady rain.<span style="">Â  
</span>Our first stop was therefore at a K-Mart to purchase two large golf 
umbrellas.<span style="">Â  </span>We donned our raingear, 
slipped our clues into a plastic sheet protector and were off to hunt our first 
game box.<span style="">Â  </span>Our plan was to do the 
Kent county boxes on Friday, before it got too busy with the Air Show traffic 
expected on the weekend.<span style="">Â  </span>Luckily 
most of the boxes only required a short walk, so we were continually jumping out 
of the car, flourishing our umbrellas, capturing the box and then bringing it 
back to the car to stamp in and then making the return journey to replace the 
box.<span style="">Â Â Â  </span>One plus is that 
there werenÂ’t many other people out &amp; about, so we didnÂ’t have to wait for 
anyone to move away from a box. (We did get to see quite a few birds at the 
Bombay Hook refuge Â– the rain didnÂ’t seem to bother them!)<span style="">Â  </span>If a longer walk was required, we took 
our backpack/chairs along and perched on these under our roof of umbrellas to 
stamp in.<span style="">Â  </span>We met Psychiker and 
Syner at one box, but due to the rain our chit-chat was minimal as we hunkered 
in our vehicles.<span style="">Â  </span>We kept thinking 
the rain would stop, but after 10.5 hours and finding 21 boxes, the rain was 
still coming down.<span style="">Â  </span>When we looked 
for Â“just one more boxÂ” before heading to Rehoboth Beach, we found the Â“chunk of 
brickÂ” but it was sitting in a pool of water.<span style="">Â  </span>We thought perhaps the box was under it, 
but no sign of it. <span style="">Â </span>We poked around 
in the pool with sticks and finally Martini Man said Â“what the heckÂ” and just 
started feeling around with his hands under water.<span style="">Â  </span>Still no luck, so we gave up and made a 
mad dash to meet SewSowBizzy, Team Little Dog, and Miz Scarlet for dinner.<span style="">Â  </span>We had a leisurely dinner since we kept 
expecting Irene of Hikers &amp; Hound to appear.<span style="">Â  </span>It wasnÂ’t until later in the evening 
that we found out about her car problems.<span style="">Â  
</span>At the restaurant we had an opportunity to find a box hidden there and 
see some other interesting stamps carved by Miz Scarlet.</p>
<p class="ygrps-yiv-1042246264MsoNormal" style="MARGIN:0in 0in 0pt;">Â </p>
<p class="ygrps-yiv-1042246264MsoNormal" style="MARGIN:0in 0in 0pt;">We then drove to Lewes and 
checked into our hotel there.<span style="">Â  </span>When 
we woke up the next morning, it looked like the rain had stopped.<span style="">Â  </span>However when we went out to the car we 
discovered that it was in fact Â“mistingÂ” and definitely wet out.<span style="">Â  </span>In addition, there was a FIERCE 
wind!<span style="">Â  </span>OK, here we go againÂ…..<span style="">Â  </span>We started off by visiting the 
restaurant boxes in Rehoboth Beach since we figured there wouldnÂ’t be much 
traffic on the sidewalks or roads early morning since most establishments were 
closed.<span style="">Â  </span>However the greyhounds that 
were visiting the beach that weekend all seemed to be out &amp; about with their 
owners, so we still had to exercise some stealth.<span style="">Â  </span>Luckily the first several boxes of the 
morning were drive-bys, since there is no way we could have kept the umbrellas 
upright and right-side out in that WIND!<span style="">Â  
</span>We could see the huge waves crashing onto the beach as we drove along the 
ocean.<span style="">Â  </span>By the time we reached the 
James Farm Preserve mid-morning, the mist/rain seemed to have stopped and we 
were thrilled to actually walk along the trail without needing umbrellas.<span style="">Â  </span>However we encountered a different water 
problem Â– a flooded trail!<span style="">Â  </span>By 
reviewing the map, we plotted an alternate route and managed to find the second 
box via a different route.<span style="">Â  </span>The same 
thing happened at Holts Landing Â– lots of water on the trail meant we had to 
figure out a different place to park the car and come in from another trail to 
find the first box.<span style="">Â  </span>We then 
followed the clues toward the second box only to discover more flooding.<span style="">Â  </span>Again another reroute allowed us to get 
to the box.<span style="">Â  </span>Wow, SSB never told us 
it would be THIS challenging!</p>
<p class="ygrps-yiv-1042246264MsoNormal" style="MARGIN:0in 0in 0pt;">Â </p>
<p class="ygrps-yiv-1042246264MsoNormal" style="MARGIN:0in 0in 0pt;">Later on in the day we met the Go 
Fish team on a trail and later yet we met Rozebud and Geckospot.<span style="">Â  </span>Everyone agreed to wait until the 
gathering to do exchanges since we were all on a mission to find as many boxes 
and game pieces as possible before Sunday afternoon.<span style="">Â  </span>(We also saw an owl and a cool turtle on 
some of the trails.) The sky was still overcast throughout the day, but luckily 
there was only very sporadic light rain.<span style="">Â  
</span>By the time it was getting dark, the weather seemed to be improving.<span style="">Â  </span>We therefore decided to tackle the 3.5 
mile trail at Killens Pond State Park as a night boxing adventure.<span style="">Â  </span>After a stop at Ace Hardware to purchase 
2 flashlights, we entered the park at the campground and started doing the two 
sets of clues from the middle.<span style="">Â  </span>As 
we went along, the clouds started to dissipate and a full moon appeared!<span style="">Â  </span>We didnÂ’t even need our flashlights when 
we were in the open fields.<span style="">Â  </span>However 
when we were in the woods we still turned them on, especially when we saw 
something scurrying ahead of us.<span style="">Â  </span>I 
thought<span style="">Â  </span>it looked like a skunk, and 
Martini Man used his flashlight to confirm the sighting.<span style="">Â  </span>Needless to say, we slowed down our pace 
QUITE a bit to let him get ahead of us.<span style="">Â  
</span>We had no desire to be wearing Â“eau de skunkÂ”!<span style="">Â  </span>We managed to find 5 of the 7 boxes in 
the dark (couldnÂ’t see a thresher in the dark and couldnÂ’t figure out what the 
Â“BeFOUR and AfterÂ” clue referred to.)<span style="">Â  
</span>All in all a good day Â– weather wasnÂ’t too bad and we managed to find 28 
boxes!</p>
<p class="ygrps-yiv-1042246264MsoNormal" style="MARGIN:0in 0in 0pt;">Â </p>
<p class="ygrps-yiv-1042246264MsoNormal" style="MARGIN:0in 0in 0pt;">We woke up early the next day to 
try to squeeze in as many boxes as possible before heading to the park for the 
gathering.<span style="">Â  </span>Martini Man retrieved 
the first box of the day by walking out of our hotel room door and rounding the 
corner to enter the lot of the adjoining restaurant.<span style="">Â  </span>He then brought it back to the room so 
we could stamp in.<span style="">Â  </span>How 
convenient!<span style="">Â  </span>(No wonder SSB 
recommended this hotel!)<span style="">Â  </span>After 
another restaurant box we headed to the Junction-Breakwater trail.<span style="">Â  </span>What a pleasure to be walking in 
sunshine!<span style="">Â  </span>Next we looped back to 
Henlopen State Park and encountered what appeared to be a major biking 
event.<span style="">Â  </span>Luckily the bikers were 
spread out when we entered the park and we were able to access all the roads and 
parking lots we needed.<span style="">Â  </span>However it 
was strange to be walking on a sandy trail in the woods accompanied by rock 
music and cheering (we figured the finish line must have been nearby).<span style="">Â  </span>Our last stop before the gathering was 
at AbbottÂ’s Mill Pond to find the two boxes there, bringing us to 15 found for 
the day.<span style="">Â  </span>We then hopped in the car, 
but soon noticed some paper fluttering under the windshield wiper.<span style="">Â  </span>We pulled over and found a note from 
Psychiker and Syner promising beer at the park!<span style="">Â  </span>We headed over with not much time to 
spare to construct our poker hands and Scrabble words before the deadline.<span style="">Â  </span>We also submitted our Clue guess, our 
Monopoly totals and our Bingo cards.<span style="">Â  
</span>After that we enjoyed some of SSBÂ’s delicious chili and spent several 
hours chatting and doing exchanges with the rest of the friendly crew that 
turned out for the event.<span style="">Â  </span>It was 
great to see several boxers we had met in past visits to the east coast as well 
as many other boxers we hadnÂ’t met yet. (Also nice to see Dude still enjoying 
himself, especially when Irene was slipping him all those cookies!).</p>
<p class="ygrps-yiv-1042246264MsoNormal" style="MARGIN:0in 0in 0pt;">Â </p>
<p class="ygrps-yiv-1042246264MsoNormal" style="MARGIN:0in 0in 0pt;">We had most of the day Monday 
before we had to fly home.<span style="">Â  </span>We slept 
in a bit later than the previous days and then headed back to Henlopen to find 
six other non-game boxes (we couldnÂ’t find several others and suspect some may 
be missing).<span style="">Â  </span>We then decided to 
search for the one Games series we had run out of time for before the event Â– 
Sailing the Sussex Shore.<span style="">Â  </span>(It 
sounded like it was a good one to have skipped, since we had heard some of that 
area was flooded.)Â  We were very pleased to find that the water had receded 
off the roads, so we were able to get through, and lo &amp; behold, we found a 
box that had definitely been under water for a day or so!Â  Luckily it was 
weighted down by a good-sized rock, so it didn't float away.Â  It did have 
some water in it, but since the baggies were sealed well, the contents were 
fine.Â  We found all four boxes in the series and then headed back to 
Baltimore for another crab cake dinner before catching our flight.</p>

to everyone who participated in the event and made us feel welcome, and MAJOR

it to the event.<span style="">Â  </span>Lots of great

Even <br/>in this tragic time for Sheba and family, life goes on and hopefully <br/>she can join us on the trails again soon. <br/><br/>More pics have
 been posted to AQ and the winners are listed under the <br/>Blue Button. Even with my attempt to stand guard at the Event Log <br/>and learn names/faces Â– I still blew it. I think it was the party of <br/>5 called The B's that left me confused. I'm thinking the 2B's were <br/>the grill myster and wife, but not sure about rest of family. Please <br/>email me off list to correct my AQ photos. Also, Dalphinus need to <br/>know which is Carl and the kids trail names.<br/><br/>I will try to find time next week to post the boxes to AQ - although <br/>I may cheat and not post the clues! In order to give carving credit <br/>to the boxes they have to be listed individually. But the clues do <br/>not lend themselves to being broken apart. Each box will have the <br/>same link to DE Clues (Tripod) and non-gather folks will just have <br/>to figure them out. Will need to update clues for the missing boxes <br/>though.<br/><br/>The Dining Around restaurant boxes will be placed in their proper
 <br/>locations by the end of Oct. And the REAL DogFish Head may end up at <br/>the brewery. Will also get Sushi and Julia planted.<br/><br/>WI Hiker reported that the Sail Boat at the boat launch has <br/>resurfaced and she dried it out.<br/><br/>After the gather Dalphinus et al were the First Finders for WV <br/>Licence Plate and the TopsyTurvey Wedding Cake at Killen's Pond. I <br/>was surprised no one had questioned me about that clue "a tree beFOUR <br/>and AFTER 50 steps". <br/><br/>Thanks again everyone, and NO there will not be a DE GAMES II - <br/>unless someone else wants to grab the baton.<br/><br/>Judy B<br/>sewsowbizzy <br/><br/></div></div></blockquote><br/><p>

 Friday morning we looked out our hotel window to see steady rain.<span>Â  </span>Our first stop was therefore at a K-Mart to purchase two large golf umbrellas.<span>Â  </span>We donned our raingear, slipped our clues into a plastic sheet protector and were off to hunt our first game box.<span>Â  </span>Our plan was to do the Kent county boxes on Friday, before it got too busy with the Air Show traffic expected on the weekend.<span>Â  </span>Luckily most of the boxes only required a short walk, so we were continually jumping out of the car, flourishing our umbrellas, capturing the box and then bringing it back to the car to stamp in and then making the return journey to replace the box.<span>Â Â Â  </span>One plus is that there werenÂ’t many other people out &amp; about, so we didnÂ’t have to wait for anyone to move away from a box. (We did get to see quite a few birds at the Bombay Hook refuge Â– the rain didnÂ’t seem to bother them!)<span>Â 
 </span>If a longer walk was required, we took our backpack/chairs along and perched on these under our roof of umbrellas to stamp in.<span>Â  </span>We met Psychiker and Syner at one box, but due to the rain our chit-chat was minimal as we hunkered in our vehicles.<span>Â  </span>We kept thinking the rain would stop, but after 10.5 hours and finding 21 boxes, the rain was still coming down.<span>Â  </span>When we looked for Â“just one more boxÂ” before heading to Rehoboth Beach, we found the Â“chunk of brickÂ” but it was sitting in a pool of water.<span>Â  </span>We thought perhaps the box was under it, but no sign of it. <span>Â </span>We poked around in the pool with sticks and finally Martini Man said Â“what the heckÂ” and just started feeling around with his hands under water.<span>Â  </span>Still no luck, so we gave up and made a mad dash to meet SewSowBizzy, Team Little Dog, and Miz Scarlet for dinner.<span>Â  </span>We had a leisurely dinner
 since we kept expecting Irene of Hikers &amp; Hound to appear.<span>Â  </span>It wasnÂ’t until later in the evening that we found out about her car problems.<span>Â  </span>At the restaurant we had an opportunity to find a box hidden there and see some other interesting stamps carved by Miz Scarlet.</div> <div class="ygrps-yiv-65082710MsoNormal"></div> <div class="ygrps-yiv-65082710MsoNormal">We then drove to Lewes and checked into our hotel there.<span>Â  </span>When we woke up the next morning, it looked like the rain had stopped.<span>Â  </span>However when we went out to the car we discovered that it was in fact Â“mistingÂ” and definitely wet out.<span>Â  </span>In addition, there was a FIERCE wind!<span>Â  </span>OK, here we go againÂ…..<span>Â  </span>We started off by visiting the restaurant boxes in Rehoboth Beach since we figured there wouldnÂ’t be much traffic on the sidewalks or roads early morning since most establishments were closed.<span>Â  </span>However the
 greyhounds that were visiting the beach that weekend all seemed to be out &amp; about with their owners, so we still had to exercise some stealth.<span>Â  </span>Luckily the first several boxes of the morning were drive-bys, since there is no way we could have kept the umbrellas upright and right-side out in that WIND!<span>Â  </span>We could see the huge waves crashing onto the beach as we drove along the ocean.<span>Â  </span>By the time we reached the James Farm Preserve mid-morning, the mist/rain seemed to have stopped and we were thrilled to actually walk along the trail without needing umbrellas.<span>Â  </span>However we encountered a different water problem Â– a flooded trail!<span>Â  </span>By reviewing the map, we plotted an alternate route and managed to find the second box via a different route.<span>Â  </span>The same thing happened at Holts Landing Â– lots of water on the trail meant we had to figure out a different place to park the car
 and come in from another trail to find the first box.<span>Â  </span>We then followed the clues toward the second box only to discover more flooding.<span>Â  </span>Again another reroute allowed us to get to the box.<span>Â  </span>Wow, SSB never told us it would be THIS challenging!</div> <div class="ygrps-yiv-65082710MsoNormal"></div> <div class="ygrps-yiv-65082710MsoNormal">Later on in the day we met the Go Fish team on a trail and later yet we met Rozebud and Geckospot.<span>Â  </span>Everyone agreed to wait until the gathering to do exchanges since we were all on a mission to find as many boxes and game pieces as possible before Sunday afternoon.<span>Â  </span>(We also saw an owl and a cool turtle on some of the trails.) The sky was still overcast throughout the day, but luckily there was only very sporadic light rain.<span>Â  </span>By the time it was getting dark, the weather seemed to be improving.<span>Â  </span>We therefore decided to tackle the 3.5 mile trail at
 Killens Pond State Park as a night boxing adventure.<span>Â  </span>After a stop at Ace Hardware to purchase 2 flashlights, we entered the park at the campground and started doing the two sets of clues from the middle.<span>Â  </span>As we went along, the clouds started to dissipate and a full moon appeared!<span>Â  </span>We didnÂ’t even need our flashlights when we were in the open fields.<span>Â  </span>However when we were in the woods we still turned them on, especially when we saw something scurrying ahead of us.<span>Â  </span>I thought<span>Â  </span>it looked like a skunk, and Martini Man used his flashlight to confirm the sighting.<span>Â  </span>Needless to say, we slowed down our pace QUITE a bit to let him get ahead of us.<span>Â  </span>We had no desire to be wearing Â“eau de skunkÂ”!<span>Â  </span>We managed to find 5 of the 7 boxes in the dark (couldnÂ’t see a thresher in the dark and couldnÂ’t figure out what the Â“BeFOUR and
