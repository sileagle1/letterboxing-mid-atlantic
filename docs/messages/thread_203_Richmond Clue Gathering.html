about the Clue series that might (or not) be helpful.<br/>
<br/>
The rope is the toughest of the weapons. I was second to try the ones in<br/>
Dorey Park, but I was FTF on the rope. The other boxer going for all the<br/>
FTFs missed it. As a minor hint, I recall joking that the leaves they had<br/>
originally covered the rope with turned to sand.<br/>
<br/>
I'm having trouble with landmarks in Poor Farm Park. I'm getting ready for<br/>
my fourth visit there. In fairness, I haven't been just letterboxing while<br/>
there. There is also a seven part geocache (#1 has the lat/long for #2,<br/>
etc.). Since I print maps and don't carry a GPS for that hobby, I have to do<br/>
those one at a time, so I'm only getting a couple of boxes on each visit. It<br/>
took two visits to see the landmarks for #1 and #4 and I haven't found the<br/>
landmarks for #3 in three attempts.<br/>
<br/>
Remember that there is a fourth park involved. I know where it is and it is<br/>
the most central of the four. I know Dorey and Poor Farm have shelters. I'm<br/>
remember that the fourth park had shelters the last time I was there, but I<br/>
haven't been there in over ten years. I haven't been to Powhite yet.<br/>
<br/>
I did all five in Dorey in about 100 minutes, which included 9 holes of disc<br/>
golf. Knowing the trails at Poor Farm, those boxes are doable in about 3<br/>
hours. The owners posted an estimate of two hours or so for Powhite. The<br/>
fourth park is fairly small, so three should take more than 45 minutes<br/>
there. I think it's possible to do the series in a very long day. Figure 7<br/>
hours of actual walking, plus an hour between each park (30-40 drive, 20-30<br/>
rest and eat). The proposed date in October is still in Savings time, so<br/>
that will help some.<br/>
<br/>
For camping, Pocahontas is the nearest state park. There is a private<br/>
campground near the interstate just south of Ashland, but reports about that<br/>
place vary, with negatives outnumbering positives. With careful shopping,<br/>
you should be able to find an acceptable motel under $40, even on a<br/>
Saturday.<br/>
<br/>
I know biking is OK at Powhite and Poor Farm, but I'm not sure about Dorey.<br/>

&gt; Well come new member!  I realllly want to come down and do the Clue<br/>
series.  I'll be interested to know if any of them are missing.<br/>
&gt;<br/>

&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; What a great idea to go by bike!  Thanks.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; If you didn't find Mrs. White with the rope... that means she did it!<br/>

&gt; The Clue series is Really cool.  I finished it (missed Mrs. White and<br/>
couldn't find the rope)  But Loved the series.  I wish I'd taken my Mt. Bike<br/>
down there to find the people with. Then again I have a friend who hasn't<br/>
done the People or the weapons and it I could always go with her and take my<br/>
bike :^)<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; The date will be definite - I will be there.<br/>
&gt; And with the interest in the Clue Series - and it's magnitude (24<br/>
&gt; boxes)- it would be a good event 'theme' 'goal' 'challenge'.<br/>
&gt; Even if some folks have already started the series, they could be put<br/>
&gt; in charge of preping lunch %^)<br/>
&gt; The series involves 3 parks reached from different directions:<br/>
&gt; Rooms in Poor Farm Park - from North or West of Richmond<br/>
&gt; Weapons in Dorey Park - from East of Richmond<br/>
&gt; Suspects in Powhite Park - from South or West of Richmond<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;                     DISTANCE DRIVE TIME<br/>
&gt; Dorey to Powhite     19.3 mi  23 min<br/>
&gt; Powhite to Poor Farm 24.5 mi  27 min<br/>
&gt; Poor Farm to Dorey   30.3 mi  35 min<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; If we have a dozen or so folks interested - it will not do to have<br/>
&gt; them all in a congo line going box to box.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; SUGGESTION: we start at two or three parks and meet up at Powhite<br/>
&gt; (the most central)for lunch (or another nearby location with<br/>
&gt; pavillion).  This will require CELL PHONE links to report status.<br/>
&gt; There will need to be a lead person for each park -- I volunteer for<br/>
&gt; POOR FARM (coming from the North, I am).  I need two volunteers with<br/>
&gt; cell phones for DOREY &amp; POWHITE.  You can email me off list sowbiz[at]<br/>
&gt; yahoo[dot]com.  Once the leads are established we will seek team<br/>
&gt; participants so there are at least 3 no more than 6 per park.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I have no idea if all 24 boxes can be found in a day.  If folks want<br/>
&gt; to camp for a day and resume on Sunday - that is good for me (except<br/>
&gt; I'll be camping in my brother's guest rm).  But camping will not be<br/>
&gt; part of my expertise (i.e. that's not my job!)<br/>
