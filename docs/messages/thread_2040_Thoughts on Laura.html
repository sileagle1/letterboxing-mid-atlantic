<br/>
Thank you for your kind words.  I forget who coined the term "Brother<br/>
Buzzard," but I absolutely love it.  It was very difficult to deliver<br/>
that sermon today, but I'm so glad I was able to help in that way.<br/>
<br/>
Today was a GOOD day, I think.  Not an easy one, not a happy one.  But<br/>
a GOOD one.<br/>
<br/>
MizScarlet, I gotta say, you're 100% right:  "It's not just finding<br/>
tupperware in the woods, it's finding the people who find the<br/>
tupperware."  That's the whole thing.  <br/>
<br/>
I think I have to break down here a bit.  When I discovered<br/>
letterboxing in January 2004, I immediately loved it, and I loved<br/>
doing it ALONE.  I was a solo boxer, although I dragged some friends<br/>
along from time to time.  I had no interest in meeting all of you, or<br/>
even knowing who you were in real life...I thought the anonymity was<br/>
part of what made it cool.  I loved how I could kind of, sort of,<br/>
connect with other people in this distant way.  Then the Silent One<br/>
emailed me and brought me into the fold.  I went very hesitantly and<br/>
tentatively to Boxtoberfest 2004, and Team Lightin' Bug immediately<br/>
grabbed me and said, "Let's go looking for boxes!"  And then, slowly,<br/>
I met so many of you.  And slowly, I've begun to care for and love so<br/>
many of you.  I still enjoy boxing alone a lot of the time, but<br/>
there's something about being in this community that's beyond words. <br/>
How else could Cyclonic and I get along so well?  He and I are about<br/>
as far apart as two people can get on the political spectrum, and we<br/>
both feel pretty strongly about our views.  In another venue, perhaps<br/>
he and I would have written each other off.  Nonetheless, I view him<br/>
as a dear friend.  <br/>
<br/>
And that's just one example.  How do we do this?  How does stamp<br/>
carving and treasure hunting do this?  How has this hobby, this HOBBY,<br/>
touched me in ways as deep as I've ever felt in church?  How do I have<br/>
the nerve to mass email this to so many people?  I don't know, but<br/>
thank God all this is true.<br/>
<br/>
I am honored, awed, and humbled right now.  I am in the presence of<br/>
greatness.  This group is just incredible.  And you know what, I think<br/>
a lot of us have noticed this recently.  Laura has helped us realize<br/>
this.  "A child shall lead them."  Thank God for Laura!<br/>
<br/>
Let's continue to be incredible to each other, and especially to Sheba<br/>
over the next weeks, months, years.  Let's continue to be this source<br/>
of joy and hope, this conduit of all the great things people can be.<br/>
<br/>
Peace,<br/>
Brother Buzzard<br/>

Even when boxing solo I feel the community. I like<br/>
going into the woods alone at times finding a box and<br/>
feeling that certain conection when I recognize a sig<br/>
stamp. There is still that feeling of anonymity, I<br/>
will never meet most of the boxers who log into my<br/>
boxes. But there is nothing like finding an homage<br/>
stamp in a log and getting the joke.<br/>

into the home, and she looks up and says to me, "You DO have a tie!"   I <br/>
find this amazing.<br/>
<br/>
I know I am taking this a bit hard, more then I would have ever thought <br/>
I would.  I don't know what it is about the whole situation, but I find <br/>
even now I have tears welling up at the edges of my eyes, just barely <br/>
being held back.  I cannot imagine what Sheba is going through, but one <br/>
thing is for sure, she has people here that love her and care for her <br/>
very much, and I truly believe that is helping her get through this.<br/>
<br/>
The Mainline Maven, Mizscalet, you have hit on something that I think <br/>
often gets overlooked.  Those carefully planned (or in Irene's case, <br/>
just thrown) boxes have people behind them.  They have a story all their <br/>
own.  It is often said that to find some of the mystery boxes you have <br/>
to get into the head of those who planted them, think like they think, <br/>
see things as they see things.  But that can be said of any box.  They <br/>
each have a story to tell, not only about themselves, but also about <br/>
those who have left them.<br/>
<br/>
I am glad that we have managed to pull those people together.  We all <br/>
from all walks of life, and all have our own story to tell.  We all <br/>
share in the joy of a milestone reached, and the sorrow of a lose.<br/>
<br/>
I think that if there is anything to be gleaned from this, it is that <br/>
was are not alone, we are a family, and though we may disagree, may <br/>
fight and argue, we will always be connected by those pieces of plastic <br/>
left in the woods.<br/>
<br/>
Laura has truly left us a gift, let us not squander or forget it.<br/>
