Had planned on putting them in their 'proper' locations but then got <br/>
to thinking . . . uh oh - what is she up to now!<br/>
<br/>
A lot of DE Game boxes have nothing to do with their locations  - and <br/>
some are risky (urban) locations.<br/>
<br/>
Since I have permission for 7 boxes at Killens Pond, and since Mr <br/>
Body was found in the Murderkill River at Killens Pond,  I intend to <br/>
relocate the exCLUsion boxes to Killens Pond next Spring (no time <br/>
left this year.)  I may even ask permission to plant them on the <br/>
PondSide Trail and remove the ones on the XCountry and Life Course.  <br/>
So you can do your Trail Challenge while boxing.  Then the current <br/>
KPSP boxes will get moved to other locations in Kent or Sussex <br/>
Counties.   <br/>
<br/>
The bottom line is CHECK DE Clues (Tripod site) before you go <br/>
boxing.  Some of the clues may be changing - and I will try to <br/>
remember to make the changes in GREEN.<br/>
<br/>
Also, the main DE Games (Tripod site) will go to FREE so expect <br/>
banners thru DEC and then I'll pull it down before 2007.  Is there <br/>
any reason to keep it up?<br/>
<br/>
While DE Clues (Tripod site) will go to FREE in 2007 I'll keep it up <br/>
since I don't know if pic clues can be done on LB.org<br/>
