Commonwealth of Pennsylvania again, so wear yer orange if you are in <br/>
parks or on gamelands that permit hunting.<br/>
<br/>
While there is hunting year round in Pennsylvania, deer season is the <br/>
big one, and there are a lot of hunters out there, so there are some <br/>
guidelines your should follow.<br/>
<br/>
Archery hunting has already begun.<br/>
<br/>
Muzzleloader season begins this Saturday and the full open season opens <br/>
on October 19.<br/>
<br/>
For your safety please where your orange, 300Â²in is required, and it <br/>
must be visable at all angles.  An orange cap and vest should do the <br/>
trick, and don't forget to vest up the dog.<br/>
<br/>
All of this can be gotten at any hunting or outdoors store, or in any <br/>
sporting goods department (Wal-mart, Kmart, ect.).  It is very low cost.<br/>
<br/>
I also suggest not boxing at all in the permitted areas on October 14 or <br/>
19 or any Saturday during the season.  Again, there are alot of hunters <br/>
out there.<br/>
<br/>
Hunting is still illegal on Sundays in Pennsylvania.<br/>
<br/>
Other states have differeing laws regarding hunting, so be sure to check <br/>
on them before heading out.<br/>
<br/>
Enjoy and be safe.<br/>
