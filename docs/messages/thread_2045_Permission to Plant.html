<br/>
First, Debbie of the Radetoan's and I met with Bensalem Parks and Rec <br/>
this morning, and they pretty much gave us the go ahead to plant in <br/>
Bensalem Township Parks.  All you have to do is send Parks and Rec the <br/>
clues when the box is planted and let them know what park it is is so <br/>
that public works doesn't trash it.<br/>
<br/>
Debbie is the front person on this one, and she lurks here on the list, <br/>
so now that she is outed she can give the details ;-)<br/>
<br/>
Also, today I offically recieved permission to plant in Neshaminy State <br/>
Park.  This was kinda an experiment to get to know the proccess on it. <br/>
The DNCR has a form that needs to be filled out and the box needs to be <br/>
approved then.  It took about two weeks all together, it would be faster <br/>
if I had scouted a location ahead of time though.  In any case, next <br/>
week you can expect to find the Neshaminy Hitch Hiker Hostel in the <br/>
park.  Time for you to get to work Irene, I've already warned them.<br/>

</span></blockquote>Hi!  My family and I are fairly new to letterboxing (a little over two <br/>
months) and we are enjoying every minute of it.  We have visited some <br/>
of the boxes of the people who post here and every one has been a <br/>
wonderful adventure.  We call our team "Radetoan" which stands for RAy, <br/>
DEbbie, TOmmy, and ANnie.  Tommy and Annie are five and two.  Because <br/>
we live in Bensalem Twp, Bucks County, we thought it would be great to <br/>
plant some boxes in our home town.  The problem was that if any of the <br/>
township employees happened to come across the boxes here, they would <br/>
throw them away.  So my husband suggested that we get permission to <br/>
plant before we did anything.  Any way, long story short, after a <br/>
couple of letters to Parks and Rec and some help from Hikers and <br/>
Hounds, and Cyclonic, we now have permission to plant in any of the <br/>
parks throughout the entire township.  However, a copy of the clues and <br/>
the name of the park must be sent to Sabrina Stancil of Parks and <br/>
Recreation at the township building.  The address can be found on the <br/>
bensalem township website.  <br/>
<br/>
I'm looking forward to meeting you all on the trails.  And Cyclonic...I <br/>
do not lurk!<br/>

&gt; Hi! My family and I are fairly new to letterboxing<br/>
&gt; (a little over two <br/>
&gt; months) and we are enjoying every minute of it. We<br/>
&gt; have visited some <br/>
&gt; of the boxes of the people who post here and every<br/>
&gt; one has been a <br/>
&gt; wonderful adventure. We call our team "Radetoan"<br/>
&gt; which stands for RAy, <br/>
&gt; DEbbie, TOmmy, and ANnie. Tommy and Annie are five<br/>
&gt; and two. Because <br/>
&gt; we live in  Bensalem Twp, Bucks County, we thought<br/>
&gt; it would be great to <br/>
&gt; plant some boxes in our home town. The problem was<br/>
&gt; that if any of the <br/>
&gt; township employees happened to come across the boxes<br/>
&gt; here, they would <br/>
&gt; throw them away. So my husband suggested that we get<br/>
&gt; permission to <br/>
&gt; plant before we did anything. Any way, long story<br/>
&gt; short, after a <br/>
&gt; couple of letters to Parks and Rec and some help<br/>
&gt; from Hikers and <br/>
&gt; Hounds, and Cyclonic, we now have permission to<br/>
&gt; plant in any of the <br/>
&gt; parks throughout the entire township. However, a<br/>
&gt; copy of the clues and <br/>
&gt; the name of the park must be sent to Sabrina Stancil<br/>
&gt; of Parks and <br/>
&gt; Recreation at the township building. The address can<br/>
&gt; be found on the <br/>
&gt; bensalem township website. <br/>
&gt; <br/>

&gt;   Welcome fromout of the shadows and onto the list. It's a friendly <br/>
group as you already know. And we've all agreed to take turns trying <br/>
to make Cyclonic behave. I think your turn is coming around real <br/>
soon. <br/>

&gt; &gt; Well, some good news from Lower Bucks today.<br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; First, Debbie of the Radetoan's and I met with Bensalem Parks and <br/>
Rec <br/>
&gt; &gt; this morning, and they pretty much gave us the go ahead to plant <br/>
in <br/>
&gt; &gt; Bensalem Township Parks. All you have to do is send Parks and Rec <br/>
&gt; the <br/>
&gt; &gt; clues when the box is planted and let them know what park it is <br/>
is so <br/>
&gt; &gt; that public works doesn't trash it.<br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; Debbie is the front person on this one, and she lurks here on the <br/>
&gt; list, <br/>
&gt; &gt; so now that she is outed she can give the details ;-)<br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Hi! My family and I are fairly new to letterboxing (a little over <br/>
two <br/>
&gt; months) and we are enjoying every minute of it. We have visited <br/>
some <br/>
&gt; of the boxes of the people who post here and every one has been a <br/>
&gt; wonderful adventure. We call our team "Radetoan" which stands for <br/>
RAy, <br/>
&gt; DEbbie, TOmmy, and ANnie. Tommy and Annie are five and two. Because <br/>
&gt; we live in  Bensalem Twp, Bucks County, we thought it would be <br/>
great to <br/>
&gt; plant some boxes in our home town. The problem was that if any of <br/>
the <br/>
&gt; township employees happened to come across the boxes here, they <br/>
would <br/>
&gt; throw them away. So my husband suggested that we get permission to <br/>
&gt; plant before we did anything. Any way, long story short, after a <br/>
&gt; couple of letters to Parks and Rec and some help from Hikers and <br/>
&gt; Hounds, and Cyclonic, we now have permission to plant in any of the <br/>
&gt; parks throughout the entire township. However, a copy of the clues <br/>
and <br/>
&gt; the name of the park must be sent to Sabrina Stancil of Parks and <br/>
&gt; Recreation at the township building. The address can be found on <br/>
the <br/>
&gt; bensalem township website. <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I'm looking forward to meeting you all on the trails. And <br/>
Cyclonic...I <br/>
&gt; do not lurk!<br/>
&gt; <br/>
