Along the Way box, it has been replanted in more or less the same spot <br/>
(conveniently close to Kent Coastal Cruisin').  Different log book and <br/>
stamp, but the old clues will still get you there.  The new stamp is <br/>
hand-carved, but far from a work of art.  Visit this one for the <br/>
scenery or to read the comments from the non-letterboxers who <br/>
discovered the box years ago and still check in from time to time.  <br/>
Will repost the clues soon.</div>
