Dude, Sheba and I went to "Bark in the Park" and were the biggest money raisers there, $385! The event raised over $5000 for a no kill animal shelter. PLUS we found a box, planted a box and Dude got a big honkin' girft basket for being the best fund-raiser. And everywhere we went there were dogs and free treats, etc. He has a great time. We all did.</div> <div> </div> <div>Then Sheba mentioned she was going to Valley Forge afterwards and we said we would come along. So then she looks me in the eye and says "But I'm going up Mount Misery". So I took that as a kinda "double dog dare you" thing and said "I'm in!". We got to VF and hiked up without a problem. I had to stop and catch my breath about 57 times, and do seem to remember asking Sheba "Are we there yet?" several times. I think I did call Sheba a big fat liar once when she told me we were 2 or 3 switch backs from the summit, and then after 2 switch
 backs and we still weren't there! I got pretty cranky and started acting up. But once we got to the top I said to her "I wasn't THAT miserable, was I?" to which she replied "Heck no, I've seen you way more miserable than that!!". Hmmmmm........is that a good or bad thing?</div> <div> </div> <div>Anyway, a HUGE THANK YOU to all of our sponsors for Bark in the Park. I wrote the clues on a scrap of paper (uh oh, shades of the Wonderful Box") and have to find them somewhere in my pack. I'll then email them to you direclty along with our heartfelt thanks!</div> <div> </div> <div>And thanks to Sheba for hanging out with a bunch of smelly dogs and a cranky old broad. We had a blast,</div> <div> </div> <div>Irene and Dude - H&amp;H</div><p>
