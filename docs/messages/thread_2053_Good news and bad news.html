The bad news is that we can't make it to Boxtoberfest, which is also <br/>
Barn Cat's birthday.  Between soccer games (different times, of <br/>
course) and having relatives over to our house for a birthday dinner, <br/>
plus getting 4 sheep ready to deliver to their new owner at the NY <br/>
Sheep &amp; Wool Festival the next day, I just can't figure out how I am <br/>
going to cram in this gathering.  We are all *very* disappointed.<br/>

We are hoping to see you all on the trails or at another gathering <br/>
before too long.<br/>

Most of the Posts have the wrong name associated -- unless you open <br/>
the post to see who really said what!<br/>

And this is going back in time!  I wonder if they dropped some posts??<br/>

I somehow had the messages coming thru as TOPICS rather than <br/>
individual messages.  Therefore the last person to post against a <br/>
TOPIC had their name showing on the summary.<br/>
