dog in our front yard, poking around as if they were looking for <br/>
something. Creeeaaaakkkkkkkk... and they found it!<br/>
<br/>
She read about letterboxing in Games Magazine, finding it very <br/>
exciting. This was her 6th letterbox. Lucky, she said, that right then <br/>
our Jack Skellington box was out for Halloween in the front graveyard, <br/>
especially since it will only be out for the next couple of weeks. <br/>
<br/>
Do come by for "trick or drinking", hot cider or more. Call ahead if <br/>
you want to be sure we're around. <br/>
