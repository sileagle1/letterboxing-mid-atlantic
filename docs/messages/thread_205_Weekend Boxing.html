<br/>
Fun in the Finger Lakes of NY with the Lightnin' Bugs....<br/>
<br/>
Well, Mrs. Lightnin' Bug and I just got back from the Finger Lakes <br/>
Wine Festival at Watkins Glen Racetrack.  The little bugs were with <br/>
Oma for the weekend.  We had a blast, and the boss even partook in a <br/>
few hunts [In exchange for a visit to a bead shop in Luzerne, PA on <br/>
the way up - Not at all a problem or concern for an enlightened <br/>
bug!  ;-) ]<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, the Wine Festival was a blast - That and a couple visits to <br/>
some Lightnin' Bug family favorite wineriess resulted in some <br/>
consumption and perhaps a few purchases.  The Letterboxing was fun as <br/>
well, and Mrs. Lightnin' Bug realized that this was something <br/>
that 'she could get into' as she is a big fan of solving mysteries.  <br/>
The downside is that Mrs. Lightnin' Bug now has a nickname - The <br/>
Skeeter Pincushion!  While I was only tapped about 3 or 4 times, poor <br/>
pincushion was tapped at least 20 times (we stopped counting) and we <br/>
had to buy some hydrocortisone cream.  Maybe a skeeter magnet stamp <br/>
to accompany our personal traveler stamp.<br/>
<br/>
All told, we found 3 boxes together:<br/>
<br/>
Blueberry Patch - Hector, Finger Lakes Nat Forest (should be renamed <br/>
skeeter patch!!)<br/>
The Middle - Finger lakes mystery series (mystery, but very easy if <br/>
you know the area)<br/>
Sacajawea Stumper Geocache Letterbox Combo - Watkins Glen State Park -<br/>
 Caution NO STAMP!  Took a card with a sort of stamp and will <br/>
consider that the stamp...  %-|<br/>
<br/>
On Sunday morning, I ventured off while the Mrs. snoozed to find 2 <br/>
more:<br/>
<br/>
Spencer Crest Nature Center, Corning, NY<br/>
Turtle Pond, Corning NY<br/>
<br/>
This is a cool little preserve on the south side of the mountain <br/>
south of Corning, NY.<br/>
<br/>
Rain forced us to pass on Carantouan Springs in Waverly, NY on the <br/>
way home.  Regrets.<br/>
<br/>
Hope everbody had a good weekend.  Now to get over an incipient <br/>
migraine headache...<br/>

<div><font face="Courier New">Also went to Dollar Tree in PA for 1st time.  Biggest dollar store I've ever seen- picked up some of the Milan Classic boxes someone wrote about.  They are good.  Also bought the one and only 2 pack of spiral bound index cards they had.</font></div>
<p><font face="Courier New">Today we went out for a huge anniversary meal- we were stuffed.  Afterwards we walked it off with a search for Rifle Camp box in W. Paterson NJ.  Clues said the box was planted April 6, 2003 but the clues were listed on the "new" boxes on August 5, 2004.  We were the first to sign the logbook.</font></p>

Art! As we were heading south on the Parkway I looked over to <br/>
Garrett Mt. and said, "That place really needs a box." I must find <br/>
the clue.<br/>
We nabbed the two new boxes in Essex County, in South Mt. and Eagle <br/>
Rock reservations. Which (watch out, folks, she's switching to home-<br/>
school mom mode in full lesson mode....) are both on the first <br/>
Watchung Mountain, of which Garrett is also part. The Watchungs are <br/>
the only volcanic-based rocks in NJ, and boy, does it ever look it.<br/>
And I'm still sure we just got another South Mt. reservation box <br/>
this spring (stamp, date and notes in logbook) and the clue has <br/>
vanished. Anyone know if the box is still there?<br/>
We got both Big Green Monsters and the Along the Canal box on <br/>
Friday. LOL. I thought the "not for the faint-hearted" was to be <br/>
taken together with "wear good shoes" to mean a long hike. NOT. And <br/>
now I know. I'm faint-hearted.<br/>
Aud<br/>
at F93 and giving this up if I don't get to 100 by fall. </span></blockquote></div>

<div>I got my car out of the shop on Friday (for less than the estimate!) and immediately went mad, driving all over the area like a thing possessed.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>On Saturday morning I drove down to Calvert Cliffs State Park in MD and found the box there.  I stamped in but soon some people came down the path!  I quickly stashed the box and sat down and looked thoughtful while scribbling in my notebook; I watched them out of the corner of my eye, but I doubt they even noticed me!</div>
<div> </div>
<div>I got things properly squared away after they were gone, and proceeded to the beach where I enjoyed the fine sea breezes and hunted for fossils.  I left when hunger overcame me!</div>
<div> </div>
<div>I had wanted to hunt down the boxes at St. Mary's City and in Point Lookout, but I had to get back to Washington for my evening plans.  Hopefully next time....</div>

whipped up some more direct clues and finally got them online. Glad you <br/>

                    <div id="ygrps-yiv-718795511">I did the same thing, Thursday through Sunday. Two days in Montgomery <br/>
County Pennsylvania (I debated about driving back to New Jersey for <br/>
the night, I was so dogged tired) and then two days in Bergen County <br/>
New Jersey. I can't see how anybody gets 35 boxes in one day. I found <br/>
twenty over four days. <br/>
<br/>
And the ones that take the longest? The lost boxes. I will spend an <br/>
hour looking in the same place and going over the clues, retracing my <br/>
steps, until I can finally admit that I can't find it. It may not be <br/>
lost, but it sure isn't where I looked.<br/>

<div><font size="2">Saturday, this Gotham chick actually got out of the city, 
  drove upstate and did a couple of boxes, one mystery box that was in a really 
  cool spot, and one more. I didn't leave as early as planned and got caught up 
  in some strolling and shopping, so didn't do anymore, but my main goal was to 
  GET OUT OF THE CITY, so that was accomplished. And I don't think I'll ever be 
  one of those 50 boxes in one day kinda boxers. Speed boxing is NOT for 
  me, plus it gets dark so soon now....I wanted to head back and not get caught 
  doing some after dark alone, break my neck kinda boxing. lol </font></div>
<div> </div>
<div>I've got the car until Sunday, so I'm planning on making another couple 
  of trips up there this week. </div>

<div>Sunday I replaced one of mine here, checked on two...one there, one gone, 
  attempted to find "Yankee In The Park", which is missing as of yesterday and

  went to a movie and headed home. </div>

&gt; &gt;   Thursday my hubby and I found all three from Pilgrim Footsteps <br/>

&gt; &gt;   Friday we met friends in Portsmouth, NH and found The Weight of <br/>

&gt; &gt;   <br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt;   Saturday, this Gotham chick actually got out of the city, drove <br/>
&gt; upstate and did a couple of boxes, one mystery box that was in a <br/>
&gt; really cool spot, and one more. I didn't leave as early as planned <br/>
&gt; and got caught up in some strolling and shopping, so didn't do <br/>
&gt; anymore, but my main goal was to GET OUT OF THE CITY, so that was <br/>
&gt; accomplished. And I don't think I'll ever be one of those 50 boxes <br/>
in <br/>
&gt; one day kinda boxers. Speed boxing is NOT for me, plus it gets dark <br/>
&gt; so soon now....I wanted to head back and not get caught doing some <br/>
&gt; after dark alone, break my neck kinda boxing. lol <br/>
&gt; &gt;    <br/>
&gt; &gt;   I've got the car until Sunday, so I'm planning on making <br/>
another <br/>
&gt; couple of trips up there this week. <br/>
&gt; &gt;    <br/>
&gt; &gt;   Sunday I replaced one of mine here, checked on two...one there, <br/>
&gt; one gone, attempted to find "Yankee In The Park", which is missing <br/>
as <br/>
&gt; of yesterday and reported missing before that but the clues weren't <br/>
&gt; updated at the time. Then I went to a movie and headed home. <br/>

<div>I placed two of four boxes in a series. It's called Hurray For Hollywood, or Hollywood, the Silent Era, one of those. Maybe. Anyway. Looking, scouting, finding rocks, sneaking around all  took up most of the afternoon. Tomorrow is supposed to be really cold, so I guess that will be a laundry and carving day.</div>

<div>Humph. lol  Well, after staying up till all hours on the computer, I dragged my old self out early this morning to replace a logbook before too many people showed up at the location. Turns out they were working on the subway, in different places along the line I take down there. It took me over an hour to get to the point I should have been at after 30 minutes. Then it started going downhill from there. I was so tired and frustrated I did some shopping to sooth my troubled soul, then came home and pouted for all I was worth over the trials and tribulations of the urban boxer. They can't do some of the work during the week and some of it ongoing..................................................and ongoing...................an ongoing, that I forgot about because I don't go to that spot much.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>It's hard out there for an urban boxer. LOL </div>
