This was our first gathering and not one we will soon forget.  It was <br/>
great to be able to meet the people behind all those great stamps <br/>
we've seen in the log books.<br/>
<br/>
I think my son Tommy had the best time of all (once he stopped <br/>
hiding).  Tommy wants to know when we can come back so that he can <br/>
play with Skulking Wolf again.  Thanks D n A for the compass.  Tommy <br/>
wanted to sleep with it around his neck last night but we compromised <br/>
and he hung it from the bed post instead.  Irene - your dancing bear <br/>
bat stamp is his favorite from his entire collection.<br/>
<br/>
We really appreciate all the hard work you put into making a fun day.<br/>

Found "Tanx" location, no problem.  Trying to get the box in the dark <br/>

Ray was determined though.<br/>

Glad to hear Harris did well.  Neglectful???  I think not.  A girl <br/>

 self"!  :)  </div> <div> </div> <div><strong>Congrats to D&amp;A for winning the raffle and congrats to Von Der Insells for winning the 50/50.</strong></div> <div> </div> <div>I'm sorry that there wasn't much "'going on" (carving class, log book class etc) but I find "going with the flow" to be much more casual and easier than trying to cram everything in, in only a few hours.  I'm sorry this year there wasn't a group photo either.  I had hoped and tried to keep that on schedule but as you all know there wasn't one.  Thankfully I took lots of photos and plan on posting them real soon.  </div> <div> </div> <div>Sometime this week my hubby will be taking the food to the South Jersey food bank and I will keep you posted as to how much you'all donated.  It sure felt like more than last years 91 lbs. of food.  </div> <div> </div> <div>I also wanted to say a special thank
 you to everyone that exchanged with my niece, "Princess Ann" (Bobbi Ann) &lt;the little girl with the makeup on&gt;.  I've been telling her about letterboxing for what seems like forever and this was her first "official" gathering and her first "real" exchange with other 'boxers.  She had soo much fun and before I knew it she was sitting at the exchange table and asking people for exchanges.  I was so proud of her - I think she's an official letterboxer now.  </div> <div> </div> <div>Well, thanks again to everyone that came out and celebrated the day with us.  I had a blast!!  I can't wait til next years gathering.  Now... where... to hold it.  I'm taking suggestions for next years location (I had 2 ideas given to me at the gathering)  Put you're suggestions in for next years site &lt;I can't guarantee I'll use them though&gt;.  I'd really like to stay in New Germany but may consider a site
 in Eastern PA (close to Philly).  </div> <div> </div> <div><img src="https://ec.yimg.com/ec?url=http%3A%2F%2Fus.i1.yimg.com%2Fus.yimg.com%2Fi%2Fmesg%2Ftsmileys2%2F07.gif&amp;t=1575927800&amp;sig=VjqafJopfj.dqNuscFSq0Q--~E"/> Thanks again to all the attendees.  'Boxtoberfest gets better and better each year.  I'm off to start thinking up some 'evil' for next years event.  </div> <div> </div> <div> </div> <div>going back to lurkdom,</div> <div> </div> <div>"letterboxingbee"</div> <div>~Bev</div> <div> </div> <div> </div><p>

<br/>
I'm finally coming out of the shadows to thank you AGAIN for hosting <br/>
such a great gathering.  As you know, it was our first...and <br/>
certainly not our last!<br/>
<br/>
I lost count on how many ways the day was awesome but here are a few <br/>
that come to mind:<br/>
<br/>
1.  You...being so welcoming and friendly...showing us the ropes <br/>
when we got there!<br/>
2.  Meeting so many fellow boxers whose boxes I've found and/or <br/>
heard/read about.<br/>
3.  Hubby got to break away from the business to hang out with his <br/>
family for the day!!!  BIG TIME AWESOME!<br/>
4.  The weather!!!<br/>
5.  Finding your awesome boxes...I never did get the time to ask you <br/>
had you made those magnificent logbooks!!!<br/>
6.  All that terrific FOOD!<br/>
7.  Pakim Pond in the fall.  Just beautiful.<br/>
8.  Meeting ANOTHER Irene!!!  I don't think I've ever met another <br/>
IRENE in my lifetime!  My only regret from the day was not getting a <br/>
photo of the two Irenes together!!!<br/>
<br/>
Thanks to you and everyone else that made the day such a success!<br/>
<br/>
Irene ~ of the SSTs<br/>

location may be a little too far for some of you to travel to, but <br/>
thankfully there were plenty of 'boxers that did make it.  Thank you <br/>
to everyone that came out on Saturday.  From the boxers that arrived <br/>
early and stayed late to the 'boxers that came but could only stay <br/>
for a few hours many many thanks for making the event.  I had sooo <br/>
much fun speaking with "oldbies" and was soo happy to meet all <br/>
the "newbies".  I was soo glad that Miss Moon decided to make the <br/>
trip down here instead of staying home and "being mad at her <br/>
self"!  :)  <br/>

&gt;   I'm sorry that there wasn't much "'going on" (carving class, log <br/>
</span></blockquote>book class etc) but I find "going with the flow" to be much more <br/>
casual and easier than trying to cram everything in, in only a few <br/>
hours.  I'm sorry this year there wasn't a group photo either.  I <br/>
had hoped and tried to keep that on schedule but as you all know <br/>
there wasn't one.  Thankfully I took lots of photos and plan on <br/>
posting them real soon.  <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;    <br/>
&gt;   Sometime this week my hubby will be taking the food to the South <br/>
</span></blockquote>Jersey food bank and I will keep you posted as to how much you'all <br/>
donated.  It sure felt like more than last years 91 lbs. of food.  <br/>

&gt;   I also wanted to say a special thank you to everyone that <br/>
</span></blockquote>exchanged with my niece, "Princess Ann" (Bobbi Ann) &lt;the little girl <br/>
with the makeup on&gt;.  I've been telling her about letterboxing for <br/>
what seems like forever and this was her first "official" gathering <br/>
and her first "real" exchange with other 'boxers.  She had soo much <br/>
fun and before I knew it she was sitting at the exchange table and <br/>
asking people for exchanges.  I was so proud of her - I think she's <br/>
an official letterboxer now.  <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;    <br/>
&gt;   Well, thanks again to everyone that came out and celebrated the <br/>
</span></blockquote>day with us.  I had a blast!!  I can't wait til next years <br/>
gathering.  Now... where... to hold it.  I'm taking suggestions for <br/>
next years location (I had 2 ideas given to me at the gathering)  <br/>
Put you're suggestions in for next years site &lt;I can't guarantee <br/>
I'll use them though&gt;.  I'd really like to stay in New Germany but <br/>
may consider a site in Eastern PA (close to Philly).  <br/>
