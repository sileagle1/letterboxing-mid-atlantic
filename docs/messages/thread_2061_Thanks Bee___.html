A wonderful low key gather with many a special new face or old timer.  <br/>
Enough boxes to keep one busy and enough chatter to keep one happy.  <br/>
One of my comrades commented that Letterboxing gatherings is one of <br/>
those special events that you never needs to ask "So, what's next?"  <br/>
Let the eeevil roll!<br/>
<br/>
Thank you to all who made it a special day.  I'd also also like to <br/>
thank those who made odd things like Sweet Potato Dumps, Yadr Sales, <br/>
Pithed Festivalites, Hats that Go Ong, and especially Cleen-Ton so much <br/>
fun<br/>
