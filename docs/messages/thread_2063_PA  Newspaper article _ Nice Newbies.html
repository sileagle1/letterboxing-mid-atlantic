I can tell you about one newbie...I have joined groups before, and <br/>
been a newbie in other things, and one thing I hate is this...people <br/>
forget what things were like when they were the new person.  So, <br/>
whenever I join a group, I expect a certain amount of this attitude.  <br/>
But, every person I have talked to, and remember, my experience thus <br/>
far has only been people on Atlas Quest...but every person has been <br/>
EXTREMELY AND COMPLETELY nice!!!!  Where do nice newbies come from?  <br/>
From wonderful nice people welcoming the newbies!<br/>

</span></blockquote>Since this is my hometown, I did some checking, and didn't turn up <br/>
anything in the Hanover newspaper.<br/>
<br/>
But I did find that the September/October issue of the Friends of <br/>
Codorus State Park newsletter included a story on letterboxing, which <br/>
I found a bit surprising (which you'll see as you read it below). It <br/>
may have accounted for some of the increased activity in the area.<br/>
<br/>
Here's the text of the article:<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;Letterboxing<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Thus begins a 'treasure hunt' that I think is one of Codorus State <br/>
&gt;Park's unique features. If you've never heard of "Letterboxing", I <br/>
&gt;think you'll find it can be a great family outing.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Go to 'Silent Doug's Letterbox' website on your computer for the <br/>
&gt;full riddle. The web address is www.letterboxing.info - copies of <br/>
&gt;the riddle are also available at the park office. Follow the clues <br/>
&gt;and you will find Doug's letterbox. Inside you will find a stamp and <br/>
&gt;a book. You bring a stamp of your own to stamp Doug's book, then <br/>
&gt;sign it and use his stamp to mark one of your own. You need to bring <br/>
&gt;your own inkpad.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;When you return, go back to the website to report that you have <br/>
&gt;found the cache.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;If you enjoy this hunt, there are Letterboxes EVERYWHERE!!<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;It is a fun game. You can nickname yourself and hit the letterbox <br/>
&gt;trail using a stamp that becomes your signature! This is great <br/>
&gt;experience in learning to follow directions. Make sure you read each <br/>
&gt;one at least twice and understand which way he is directing you <br/>
&gt;before you take the chosen trail. Doug points you to some pretty <br/>
&gt;unique features of the trail. He is very observant about peculiar <br/>
&gt;shapes of trees.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;The last time I checked, this box was still in place. Some have been <br/>
&gt;stolen, a sad ending for those excited about the end of their <br/>
&gt;treasure hunt. Please place the box back just as you found it so the <br/>
&gt;next players in the game can find it.<br/>

&gt;everyone is from people who say..."This is the first letterbox I ever<br/>
&gt;found..." which is kind of nice ... one of the new folks even<br/>
&gt;replaced the worn bags. Where are all these nice newbies coming from?<br/>
<br/>
</span></blockquote>Since this is my hometown, I did some checking, and didn't turn up <br/>
anything in the Hanover newspaper.<br/>
<br/>
But I did find that the September/October issue of the Friends of <br/>
Codorus State Park newsletter included a story on letterboxing, which <br/>
I found a bit surprising (which you'll see as you read it below). It <br/>
may have accounted for some of the increased activity in the area.<br/>
<br/>
Here's the text of the article:<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;Letterboxing<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Thus begins a 'treasure hunt' that I think is one of Codorus State <br/>
&gt;Park's unique features. If you've never heard of "Letterboxing", I <br/>
&gt;think you'll find it can be a great family outing.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Go to 'Silent Doug's Letterbox' website on your computer for the <br/>
&gt;full riddle. The web address is www.letterboxing.info - copies of <br/>
&gt;the riddle are also available at the park office. Follow the clues <br/>
&gt;and you will find Doug's letterbox. Inside you will find a stamp and <br/>
&gt;a book. You bring a stamp of your own to stamp Doug's book, then <br/>
&gt;sign it and use his stamp to mark one of your own. You need to bring <br/>
&gt;your own inkpad.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;When you return, go back to the website to report that you have <br/>
&gt;found the cache.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;If you enjoy this hunt, there are Letterboxes EVERYWHERE!!<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;It is a fun game. You can nickname yourself and hit the letterbox <br/>
&gt;trail using a stamp that becomes your signature! This is great <br/>
&gt;experience in learning to follow directions. Make sure you read each <br/>
&gt;one at least twice and understand which way he is directing you <br/>
&gt;before you take the chosen trail. Doug points you to some pretty <br/>
&gt;unique features of the trail. He is very observant about peculiar <br/>
&gt;shapes of trees.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;The last time I checked, this box was still in place. Some have been <br/>
&gt;stolen, a sad ending for those excited about the end of their <br/>
&gt;treasure hunt. Please place the box back just as you found it so the <br/>
&gt;next players in the game can find it.<br/>
