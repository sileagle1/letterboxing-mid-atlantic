                    <div id="ygrps-yiv-1947096943">....I just booked my room at what was the Holiday Inn Select..(now <br/>
called the Old Town Hotel)..in the heart of Old Town Alexandria, <br/>
Virginia...Since being renamed, with new owners..I guess the price <br/>
went way down.  Three months ago, I couldnt find a room there for <br/>
under $219.00....but now rooms are $129.00.  Its a pretty reasonable <br/>
rate, as the hotel looked awesome, and I know a few of us will be <br/>
there parting til the wee hours. <a href="http://www.hotel-ot.com/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.hotel-ot.com/</a><br/>
<br/>
..If i recall, other hotels that were a cab ride away were in the $80-<br/>
$90 range, but its been awhile since I looked into that.<br/>
<br/>
Just thought I'd give those coming, a head's up, on the price drop at <br/>
the hotel in the heart of the pub crawl...might lure some other to <br/>
stay there.<br/>
<br/>
see ya there</div>
