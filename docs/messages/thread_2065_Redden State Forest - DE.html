<br/>
When we found them over the Memorial Day Weekend, I recall that at <br/>
least one or two were barely hidden, but I figured that the state <br/>
forest did get the kind of traffic that a state park does, which is why <br/>
they were still around.<br/>
<br/>
I hope that the state forests are willing to copy the parks' approach <br/>
to letterboxes.  However, parks cannot allow a box in any section that <br/>
is designated as a nature preserve, and if a state forest has that <br/>
status...<br/>
<br/>
Agreed with Otis' Friends - we have emailed Jessica about her boxes and <br/>
received no reply.  She may not be very active at the moment.<br/>
