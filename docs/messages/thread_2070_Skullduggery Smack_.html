be really bad or really good. At this point I'm just<br/>
looking forward to putting 2 really busy and stressful<br/>
weeks behind me. I'm a little over extended with some<br/>
commitments right now an d can't wait for them to be<br/>
done. Why do I do this to myself! And oh yeah I still<br/>
have to carve my stamp! I've got the image so It's<br/>
just a matter of the time.<br/>
Camping last week after the gather was just what I<br/>
needed. Nothing to do except make sure Irene didn't<br/>
light fire to all of South Jersey. Just need to find a<br/>
way to pee in the middle of the night without getting<br/>
out of sleeping bag.<br/>
