to have this fine stamp in their logs. Oh, it'll cost ya a round for <br/>
the team.:) Funky Feline and Spidey, y'all can stamp it as soon as we <br/>
meet up. My event vest is out and getting prepped with some more <br/>
patches I've collected since the last event. I will stock the pockets <br/>
with some goodies to be discreetly exchanged with some and blatantly <br/>
thrust upon others. I have an extra LB PNW patch that I would love to <br/>
trade with someone for a different patch. Already have the patches for <br/>
LBMA,LBNE, LB Ontario,LB Great Lakes,and LBPNW. <br/>
  Lock your doors and hide your children, Alexandria. The Catoctin <br/>
Crawlers are comin' your way.  <br/>
