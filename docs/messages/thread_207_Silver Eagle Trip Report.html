Sorry to report, but apparently my Phila Zoo Box is gone.<br/>
I am trying to determine if someone just took it, or if the Zoo officials<br/>
removed it.  In either case, I have deleted the box from the master list.<br/>
I don't want anyone else spinning their wheels.<br/>

I'll try to let you know for sure when it gets a little closer.<br/>

Looking forward to finding your box when I go check on mine (still <br/>
haven't done so!). From the clues, it looks like your box in <br/>
Pennypack is about a minute away from my first Ben Franklin box..too <br/>
bad you didn't have the time to get it!<br/>

<div>I hope you enjoyed the contrast between my crude Orion stamp and, I hope, better, The Inventor.  I better get down there and replace the logs with the Time article being released.  If they go missing I can replace the stamps but the fun thing about microboxes is you get to replace and keep the logs since they fill up.</div>
