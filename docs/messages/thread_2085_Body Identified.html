eating fish from the Potomac no wonder they were found floating."<br/>
I remember when I was nine and the class rode the Dandy from Alex to <br/>
Mt Vernon and we were competing by counting the number of dead fish <br/>
floating on either side of the boat(ship?).  But I digress.<br/>
<br/>
Apparently a fish wasn't the murder weapon or I would have surely <br/>
suspected the Fisherman was feeding the local detectives a line.<br/>
