I tend to agree.  I go out of state quite a bit, so I like to make them jump <br/>
around, but if I can't get it somewhere far-flung anytime soon, I like to put <br/>
them in a mystery or WOM box just to make victory a little sweeter for the <br/>
next person.  But that's just me.  :)<br/>
<br/>
Oh, and I always contact the placer of the HH and tell them where I found it. <br/>
 I don't tell them where I left it unless they ask.  :)<br/>
