development plan along the Alexandria waterfront. Both men were found <br/>
dead in the Potomac River in what had been believed by Police to be <br/>
separate incidents within a 24 hour period. The Waterfront Economic <br/>
Development Group Inc. (WEDGI) was formed two years ago to purchase and <br/>
develop a riverfront parcel on the south side of town near the old Ford <br/>
plant. Lawsuits and disagreement among the investors has delayed what <br/>
should have been a profitable venture.</div>
