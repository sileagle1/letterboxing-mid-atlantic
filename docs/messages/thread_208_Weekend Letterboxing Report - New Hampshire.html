<div>All boxes were great, in great locations. I must make a special comment about Blue Bears Adventure. These clues were so much fun to follow and the park was so beautiful that if you get the chance to go to NH, make sure you hunt these. Check out the clues on the homepage, how original!</div>

<div>While there I also was inspired to create a hitchiker and mail to my friends to set loose for me. I think I will call it the "New Hampshire State Bird" it will be an image of THE BIGGEST DARN MESQUITOYOU HAVE EVER SEEN. I am not kidding folks, I have never seen or felt anything like these mesquitos! They are HUGE, drink gallons of blood and actually followed us into our car so they could continue feasting on us. I have been camping my whole life and been bitten millions of times, but I must have over 100 red welts, and that's while using bug spray! I was reading Lightnin Bugs account of his wife's trouble with mesquitos in NY this weekend. Tell her it could have been worse, she could have been in New Hampshire!

skeeters away.  Deep Woods Off contains DEET (Di-ethyl meta <br/>
toluamide, for us chemical nerds), but it needs to be over like 15% <br/>
to be truly effective.  It also works pretty well on ticks (my <br/>
primary use for it).<br/>

I hope that it is more effective for you.<br/>
