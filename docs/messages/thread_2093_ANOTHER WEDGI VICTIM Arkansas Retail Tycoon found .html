discovered in the Potomac River near the Old Dominion Boat Club. Mr <br/>
Pickens, founder of  the Joe Bob Mart retails department store chain <br/>
was in town to attend a business meeting. Inspector Grogue, primary <br/>
investigator made no comment however three recent deaths now appear <br/>
directly related. Pickens is the third board member of the <br/>
Waterfront Economic Development Group Inc. (WEDGI) to have been <br/>
found in the river since midnight Halloween. One of the seven <br/>
surviving members reached for comment was Bebe Ganelli who has <br/>
stated she plans to take control of WEDGI as the three managing <br/>
partners have died in mysterious circumstances.<br/>
