later today that three member of  the Waterfront Economic Development <br/>
Group Inc. (WEDGI) to be found dead along the waterfront in the last <br/>
three days were murdered. All the victims were in fact killed by a <br/>
blow to the head. Additionally all three victims were seen alive just <br/>
before midnight the night prior to their deaths. This rules out a <br/>
boating accident as all the deaths occurred in exactly the same manner <br/>
but at three different days sometime around midnight.</div>
