control of  the Waterfront Economic Development Group Inc. (WEDGI).  As <br/>
reporters waited near city hall for news of the latest mysterious <br/>
deaths, Ms Gallini and her entourage held an impromptu press conference <br/>
as they left the court house. "Three members of that group have been <br/>
found dead in seventy-two hours, the surviving members have to move to <br/>
protect our own interests." When asked who might be responsible for the <br/>
deaths of her partners Ms Gallni replied: " If Reggie wasn't the first <br/>
to go he would have been the prime suspect! This whole phoney baloney <br/>
project was a scam! "</div>
