I took it to the Green Lane gathering before I mailed it and several people on the list were thrilled to see some east coast, specifically PA stamps. I think it's a great way to connect with the community beyond our local area and offers those boxers who perhaps can't handle too much hiking a way to participate in the hobby.

</span></blockquote>I sent out my first PLB (Apologies) last Fri - and am waiting to <br/>
receive the three for which I have signed up.  I think they are a <br/>
nice SIDELINE to the LB'g Adventure.  They do take a lot of time to <br/>
prepare - it is generally more than a stamp &amp; log in a sandwich box.  <br/>
I saw one at the PA gather and it also was a box of humor.  Sometimes <br/>
there are treats (since the number of stampers is pre-known).  But I <br/>
think the best part is that folks who may not be able to go hiking <br/>
can be part of the fun.  Just like virtual letterboxing (but that's <br/>
another TOTW).  And I'm not saying this just because I'm a Postal <br/>
employee (at least for another 8 months!) and appreciate the revenue.<br/>

<div> </div>
<div>On the New Boxers list I inadvertantly started a big honkin' fuss about putting log's in each box for a multiple box series. I innocently stated that on our next series, which will be 7 boxes aimed at kids, we will only be using 1 log in the very last box. We are also starting work on our "Holy Grail of Letterboxing" series will wil be 4-6 boxes and Carmen and I decided the same thing. Maybe a log in the first box to welcome boxers, and a log in the last box to thank them for playing.  Well, Some folks are pretty upset about this and gettin' pretty frisky in their posts implying that I am lazy (which I am, so good for them for noticing) and that I am somehow "cheating" my fellow boxers of the fun that they get stamping into each box and even more importantly, of counting a box as a find. To which I want to ask "sez who?" Did you not print the clues, find the box and stamp your log? Then WHO says it's not a find just cause there's no log? The International Letterboxing
 Council? What is the ILC's address so that I can write them for details? It's not that I am too cheap to buy logs, I have no problem with that and I certainly am not advocating everyone do this, it's just something Carmen and I decided. Of course I will put this in my clues so those purists who feel they can not in good conscience count 7 seperate boxes with 7 seperate stamps as 7 seperate finds simply because there aren't 7 seperate logs can avoid these abominations at all costs! Heresy! Treason! Stay away!</div>
<div> </div>
<div>So anyway, my questions to you folks are, would this upset/insult you and can this really affect someone's count? Would your enjoyment of the series be diminished by not having a log in each box? Since you folks are in my planting area I do not want to insult or upset anyone else. Maybe I will put a log in each box but tell folks I don't expect them to stamp into each one if they don't feel like it. But that kind of irks me 'cause now I feel that I am being forced to change my mind and I am a very stubborn person. But if it really is in the rules and will mess up people's counts or spoil their fun then that's not cool either. </div>
<div> </div>
<div>I must say I am constantly surprised at the things LB's get so worked up about and how often I manage to put my foot in my mouth with this hobby. A new person asked a question, I gave them my 2 cents and have gotten a $1.50 butt kickin for it. Oh well, that's what I deserve I guess.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Off topic - Dude is pretty darn sick and I am a mess. He hasn't been able to hold any food down since Saturday night. He was fine all day Saturday on the trails. I will probably be taking him to the Vet tonight. Dude is my best friend in the whole wide world and even though he is 14 and I know what's coming I am not ready to lose him yet.

It's your box, your decision, I say! I don't even count my Ps and Fs, <br/>
so I wouldn't care...less ink on my fingers from not stamping 7 times <br/>
is what I say!<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
No - there are many more important things in life to get worked up <br/>
over :)<br/>
<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
Remember that the only rule is that there are no rules! Again, I say, <br/>
it's your box - your decision. If that really ticks people off to not <br/>
have a logbook, then don't freaking go find the boxes in the first <br/>
place!!!<br/>

No rules.<br/>
Whatever.<br/>
In this case, whatever suits the series. I have a series of four <br/>
with a book in each, and in going back and reading entries, realized <br/>
they're a little close together for that. By the third book, folks <br/>
have run out of things to say and just stamp in. The fourth book <br/>
mainly shows how many haven't found the third.<br/>
My Tangram series has one book, which allowed the other boxes to be <br/>
much smaller and easier to hide. Again, very short hikes between <br/>
boxes.<br/>
I've found series where you had to hike at least half an hour <br/>
between boxes. They, IMO, deserved separate books, and had them.<br/>
If you think one book will do, go for it. How on earth could we, <br/>
sitting cozy at our keyboards, tell what suits the site?<br/>

<br/>
Frankly, I prefer your idea of only stamping into a log once. As long <br/>
as the finder is stamping a new stamp into their logbook for each box <br/>
in the series, I don't see why it would matter, especially if the <br/>
boxes aren't very far apart. We're always looking for ways to <br/>
streamline the stamping in process!<br/>
<br/>
I'm sorry to hear that Dude is not feeling well. You'll both be in my <br/>

Thanks for taking my post - that was misunderstood - to another group<br/>
to gather support to flame me.  Even after I (the offender) realizing<br/>
the post was misunderstood went in and apoligized TWice, saying it was<br/>
not made in anger and it was made tongue in cheek.  At least I tried<br/>

have to say:<br/>

Evidently in these words I failed to get the message across that there<br/>
was no animonisity coming from me:<br/>
Post #1: "I'm not yelling, criticizing, putting down, getting personal<br/>
or picking on anyone."<br/>
<br/>
Post #2 (trying for a humorous approach): "I really wasn't having a<br/>
Hiss-ey fit, honest!  :-))<br/>
Or trying to stamp on anyone's toes."<br/>
<br/>
Post #3 a different more serious approach since the first two didn't<br/>
work: "I must apologize.  I wasn't attacking anyone.  My post was not<br/>
made in anger - it was tongue in cheek, and it's my fault for not<br/>
making that clear."  <br/>
<br/>
Clearly my words have failed on all accounts.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Surely the words "Whoa Bossie!!!!" might be a tip off that the thing<br/>
was tongue in cheek.  Those aren't exactly fightin' words, in fact if<br/>
someone came at me trying to be angry and that came out of their mouth<br/>
I'd crack up. <br/>

experiencing on the new boxers list and need the opinions of my
"homies"</span></font></p>
</div>
<div>
<p class="ygrps-yiv-1571602231MsoNormal" style="margin-left:.5in;"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3"><span style="font-size:12.0pt;"> </span></font></p>

<div>
<p class="ygrps-yiv-1571602231MsoNormal" style="margin-left:.5in;"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3"><span style="font-size:12.0pt;">On the New Boxers list I inadvertantly started a big
honkin' fuss about putting log's in each box for a multiple box series. I
innocently stated that on our next series, which will be 7 boxes aimed at kids,
we will only be using 1 log in the very last box. We are also starting work on
our "Holy Grail of Letterboxing" series will wil be 4-6 boxes and
Carmen and I decided the same thing. Maybe a log in the first box to welcome
boxers, and a log in the last box to thank them for playing.  Well, Some
folks are pretty upset about this and gettin' pretty frisky in their posts
implying that I am lazy (which I am, so good for them for noticing) and that I
am somehow "cheating" my fellow boxers of the fun that they get
stamping into each box and even more importantly, of counting a box as a find.
To which I want to ask "sez who?" Did you not print the clues, find
the box and stamp your log? Then WHO says it's not a find just cause there's no
log? The International Letterboxing Council? What is the ILC's address so
that I can write them for details? It's not that I am too cheap to buy
logs, I have no problem with that and I certainly am not advocating everyone do
this, it's just something Carmen and I decided. Of course I will put this in my
clues so those purists who feel they can not in good conscience count 7 seperate
boxes with 7 seperate stamps as 7 seperate finds simply because there aren't 7
seperate logs can avoid these abominations at all costs! Heresy! Treason! Stay
away!</span></font></p>

<div>
<p class="ygrps-yiv-1571602231MsoNormal" style="margin-left:.5in;"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3"><span style="font-size:12.0pt;">So anyway, my questions to you folks are, would this
upset/insult you and can this really affect someone's count? Would your
enjoyment of the series be diminished by not having a log in each box? Since
you folks are in my planting area I do not want to insult or upset anyone
else. Maybe I will put a log in each box but tell folks I don't
expect them to stamp into each one if they don't feel like it. But
that kind of irks me 'cause now I feel that I am being forced to change my
mind and I am a very stubborn person. But if it really is in the rules and will
mess up people's counts or spoil their fun then that's not cool
either. </span></font></p>

LB's get so worked up about and how often I manage to put my foot in my mouth

gotten a $1.50 butt kickin for it. Oh well, that's what I deserve I guess.</span></font></p>
