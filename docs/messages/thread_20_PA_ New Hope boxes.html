<div><font face="Arial" family="SANSSERIF" size="2">***************************************************<br/>There should be no fee to enter the park.  At one point the park did try to institute a parking fee, with an automated gate at the parking lot near the visitors center.  The locals did not like this as it could impact on their businesses, so they put up a fuss.  Putting up a fuss did not budge the park, so they started cutting down the gate at night.  The park has pretty much given up on it.  There is a fee to go up into Bowman's Tower.</font></div>
<div> </div>
<div>If the gate is back (I have not been down there since the end of last year), you must first go into the visitor's center to get tokens to put into the gate to park in the parking lot.  There is another parking lot that is not gated next to the canal off of RT 532.  This lot is also pretty close to the visitor's center, though on a nice day it fills up pretty fast.  This lot is owned by the Delaware Canal Start Park, for which there is no fee.</div>
