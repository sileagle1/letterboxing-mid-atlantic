It's just you and me without a life, PeggySue.  At least we have our <br/>
livers. Small consolation...<br/>

We were the first to leave (had to send the babysitter home) and I'm sure the other<br/>
crawlers are still enjoying themselves in Old Town.  : )  thanks again to Team Mother<br/>
Earth for letting us into their group.  We had a great time!  I can't wait to see some of<br/>
those photos....  <br/>
