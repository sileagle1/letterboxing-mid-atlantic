time! What a lot of work you put into this! We had a <br/>
blast  "interrogating" the suspects! The Dunnabunks and Bebe Gallini <br/>
were especially fun! It was a perfecrt night to be "crawlin'" around <br/>
Old Town. The bars were great and all very friendly. I'm taking <br/>
Southern Light back to Troy's for her birthday per her request!<br/>
  As always it was great to see old friends, and, as always, missed <br/>
being able to chat and exchange with so many! See y'all at the 2007 <br/>
Crawl!<br/>
 Now, back to Motrin, coffee, and another bag of IV fluids. Safe <br/>
trails.       Koyote</div>
