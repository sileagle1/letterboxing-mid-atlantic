and Sewsowbizzy for putting on such an elaborate show. Such great <br/>
characters and story. I really liked the beer bottles idea. How <br/>
brilliant to gather in the Lyceum out of the cold to organize. <br/>
Besides the great mystery show I really enjoyed the walking tour of <br/>
Alexandria and visting all the pubs. <br/>
<br/>
So who carved what? the stamps were amazing, especially the <br/>
characters. I find faces really hard to do. There were great faces <br/>
and eyes. <br/>
<br/>
Bonus questions:<br/>
<br/>
- Where was Miss Piggy?<br/>
- What two types of game cards were found on one of the bars?<br/>
- A letter from what agency was framed over the croc hunter?<br/>
- What was under glass in what pub?<br/>
- Who slept by the ice house?<br/>
- Who got the Ring?<br/>
<br/>
Great to see everyone, <br/>
