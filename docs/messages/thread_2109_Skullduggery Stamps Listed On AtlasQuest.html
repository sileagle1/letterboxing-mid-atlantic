contributing by carving stamps. Sewsowbizzy was carving stamps and <br/>
stuffing clues into envelopes till 2:00AM Friday Night. I'm sure no <br/>
one is surprised that Sewsowbizzy was amazing in her support. It would <br/>
not have been possible to pull off this event without her help... and <br/>
this help she gave me was while she was preparing her Delaware <br/>
Gathering masterpeice.<br/>
<br/>
Green Tortuga contributed a very nice stamp that did not get used <br/>
because Crocodile Dave did not want to use the Steve Irwin image <br/>
vainly. <br/>
<br/>
Green Tortuga also contributed a 2007 Atlas Quest as a door prize.<br/>
<br/>
BullDawg designed , maintained and frequently updated a great web site <br/>
