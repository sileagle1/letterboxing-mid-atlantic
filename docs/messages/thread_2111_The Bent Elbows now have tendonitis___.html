GR, you <br/>have some pretty cool friends to be willing to dress up in character and <br/>be grilled by a bunch of drunks and asked to hand over DNA and <br/>fingerprints. Oh, and off-list, can I have the Peruvian Archeologist's ph# <br/>please...just want to call him and thank him...honestly!!! Whoa, baby! Nah, <br/>just kidding, Mr. Irene has a strict rule, no more messing around with <br/>Peruvian Archaeologists for me.<br/>   <br/>  Additionally, regarding the Bent Elbows coming in last, what can I <br/>say? Money changed hands, improprieties occurred. We'll just leave it at <br/>that. I mean, how can the only team who knew that it was a Samual Adams <br/>Black Lager on the table lose? <br/>   <br/>  As usual I had too much fun, loved seeing old friends and making new <br/>ones. Thanks to all who
 participated.<br/>   <br/>  I am keeping my Bent Elbows stamp as my new personal traveller. No <br/>special questions or riddles to get it. I just have to be drinking <br/>alcohol at the time you ask for it. So it will be an easy one to get!<br/>   <br/>  As far as a Pub Crawl in 2007, I volunteer for that one along with <br/>whomever else wants to help out. Miz Scarlet and I were brain storming <br/>all the way home and we think we're onto something. We'll get back to <br/>everyone with more details.<br/>   <br/>  Thanks again Gallant Rogue and all the wonderful carvers, and to <br/>Poison Ivy for coming up with the whole idea of a Letterboxing Pub Crawl in <br/>the first place! Both were just too much fun! <br/>   <br/>  H&amp;H of the Bent Elbows<br/><br/> <br/><p>
