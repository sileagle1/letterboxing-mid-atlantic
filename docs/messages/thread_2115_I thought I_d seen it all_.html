time at my first LB gathering/murder mystery/pub crawl.  Thanks to <br/>
everyone for reaching out to us "newbies" (who came in 2nd place BTW!) <br/>
and making us feel like part of the group!  The pictures are a <br/>
scream!  Thanks to the "suspects" for being so agreeable to humor us <br/>
all night!  I can't get over the quality of some of the stamps!!  <br/>
Kudos to the carvers!  You are amazing!  To the other members of team <br/>
Mother Earth... it was a joy "crawling" with you.  I'm looking forward <br/>
to doing it again!  And Thank You, Thank You, Thank You Gallant Rogue <br/>
et al for organizing this event!<br/>
<br/>
I delivered Mother Earth and Chasing LuLu safely to their doors after <br/>
a side-trip to Ikea.  All are happily worn out and slowly allowing <br/>
reality to seep in.<br/>
<br/>
Till next time!<br/>
