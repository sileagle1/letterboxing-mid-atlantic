..but I must say, I represented the Catoctin Crawlers well.  Me and <br/>
the wife, represented til the wee hours (about 1:30)..with a table of <br/>
3 of Team Mother Earth, and Mr Rogue....It is clear that we were the <br/>
winners of any smack talk about "who would drink the most".  Team <br/>
Mother Earth was a riot and our late conversation was classic.  Good <br/>
to see you guys.<br/>
<br/>
For those that left early, ya missed a few good things..and lucky for <br/>
me, we brought a camera, and will get the pics up this week...Look for <br/>
pictures of Poison Ivy's "full moon", and me in my underwear with the <br/>
Inspector Grogue, and more. (might need to edit some)<br/>
<br/>
Good to see some familiar faces, and some new ones.  It became hectic <br/>
late, and didnt get time to chat with everyone.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks to my team, especially Koyote and Funky Feline..they took on <br/>
the jobs of responibillity, while I just drank....which was AWESOME!</div>
