<br/>
The Hedge family had a most lovely time at your wonderful event, your<br/>
skills as a host put even her Ladyship to shame. Perhaps one day we<br/>
will be able to persuade you to be a guest lecturer for the Pristeens.<br/>
A more finely tuned and skillfully orchestrated event there has never<br/>
been.<br/>
<br/>
Warmest regards to all of your wonderfully colorful friends, what a<br/>
treat to meet them. So glad her Ladyship could help with the<br/>
incarceration of those poseurs "Lord and Lady" Dunnabuck. A true Lady<br/>
can spot a fake title, their blood is no more blue than was the state<br/>
of Texas after the last election.<br/>
<br/>
Warmest thanks for a splendid evening.<br/>
Lady Prisspott<br/>

PS My darling Bebe, We do hope you shan't be troubled but dear Izzy<br/>
was a tad upset when I mentioned your opinion of Lanacain. She was<br/>
screaming in Italian and threatening to call Marty and have some of<br/>
his people make you some sort of shoes. I didn't really understand it<br/>
all one minute she's quiet and morose the next she's screaming and<br/>
gesticulating.</div>
