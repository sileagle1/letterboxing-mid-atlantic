know how anyone is going to top this event~ I had a great time hanging <br/>
out with Team Mother Earth, although it seems we left too early for the <br/>
R rated party, damn!! My liver is still recovering!  Seeing old friends <br/>
and meeting new ones, it was perfect.  And Lady Prispott nee Hedge is <br/>
such a gracious winner!!  A big thank you to Gallant Rouge and <br/>
SewSowBizzy and all the other great participants, it really was an <br/>
excellent Pub Crawl. <br/>
