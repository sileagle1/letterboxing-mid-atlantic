<p>Bebe</p>
<p>Many Buttercups for joining the best list in letterboxing and adding to the post-crawl banter!</p>
<p>I didn't reach King Street Blues until late in the evening and stayed only moments - unfortunate for me as I have heard you and Coco were a delight. Your `personalization' of the Bebe stamped calling card was perfect. </p>
<p>Hope you will join in the future adventures of LBMA.</p>

SewSo, the stamps were wonderful, I am simply covered, COVERED in le <br/>
shame that I did not thank you properly.  You are truly an artist.<br/>

Gerania dearest, now I am worried about the little man.  You do not <br/>
suppose CoCo frightened him????<br/>
