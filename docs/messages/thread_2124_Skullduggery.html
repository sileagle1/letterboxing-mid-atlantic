of the weekend (Poison Ivy's charm, Bull Dawg's dry sense of humor,<br/>
Shell's giggle, the Hedge's zest, Scarab's kindness, George's unending<br/>
energy and enthusiasm are just a few of my lasting memories).  The<br/>
experience definitely left me wanting more.  For me the coolest part<br/>
was the people that I met and making a team out of strangers.  It's<br/>
wierd to finally meet some of you after reading your posts, finding<br/>
your boxes and passing along your hitch hikers for the past year.<br/>
<br/>
The crawl was a great way to celebrate my first year as a letterboxer.<br/>
 It was quite a distraction form my surburban housewife/mom life that<br/>
I live.  I am fondly looking forward to another event somtime soon.<br/>
<br/>
Until then I go back to the things that make me "Mother Earth"...my<br/>
kids, my pets, my garden and my Girl Scouts (not the ones on Captain<br/>
Ken's boat).<br/>
<br/>
God bless you all,<br/>
