organizing such a wonderful event.  When Art Z Mom, Mother Earth, and <br/>
I ventured North on I-95 Saturday Morning, we were full of <br/>
anticipation and Skullduggery '06 did not disappoint.  Not only was <br/>
the event itself so much fun, but we truly enjoyed meeting so many <br/>
great peopleour new teammates, intriguing suspects, and a fantastic <br/>
group of letterboxers! Thanks for welcoming us "newbies" and making <br/>
us feel right at home.  <br/>
<br/>
The Skullduggery Ball at Chadwick's was extremely enjoyable.  Even <br/>
though I don't remember how I got there, I do remember having lots of <br/>
fun until the wee hours of the morning.....flashing flesh, Moby dick, <br/>
woof.........<br/>
<br/>
Sewsowbizzy you were a great jester! Love the posted photos!  <br/>
<br/>
Can't wait for the next event!  Can I be the evidence technician <br/>
again?!?!?!<br/>
