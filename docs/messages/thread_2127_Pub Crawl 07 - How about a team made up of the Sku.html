one NOW! Thanks for the kind words... I'm so pleased so many of you <br/>
showed up and had fun. I know it can be done better and better... I <br/>
promise to attend every pub crawl in a two hundred mile radius... and <br/>
bring a team...  I think the suspects will join me. They were <br/>
impressed with you guys! Can we please please have another one soon? <br/>
