(Altho I suspect the method is sticking dirt, twigs and leaves to the <br/>
sticky side of the liner...)<br/>

                    <div id="ygrps-yiv-231363174">Roz- I bought a real pond liner from Home Depot (about $60) and cut <br/>
it into about 2ft squares - large enough to drape over the box so <br/>
rocks/branches could be laid around edges to hold in place.  <br/>
<br/>
Then I bought all the 4oz bottles of rubber cement at ACMoore when it <br/>
was on sale - took about 3/4bottle for each square - I spread <br/>
liberally.  Then sprinkled with that wonder DE sand soil.  Tried <br/>
leaves but they either didn't stick or crumbled away.  Don't try <br/>
painting it will just flake off.  But if you add enough debris over <br/>
box that should suffice.<br/>
<br/>
So you might ask at a nursery or landscaper if they are replacing <br/>
someone's pond liner and ask to buy (free?) the old leaky one.  Sorry <br/>
I didn't think of that before but I was on a mission.<br/>

&gt; I thought camo burlap was a good idea, until my boxes started getting <br/>
&gt; draged off into the woods by the critters.  They like to rip up fabric <br/>
&gt; for nesting.  <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; So far the only disadvantage for the pond liner idea is it might <br/>
&gt; create a shelter for snakes.  PLEASE us a stick to remove any box <br/>
&gt; covering.<br/>

a note that they had taken one of the stamps/log book for repair and that they'd put it<br/>
back.  That was several months ago and we never heard from them.  We'd really like at<br/>
least the stamp back if possible.  Anyone know a Hemlockian?<br/>
