yesterday.  Turned to be an open house so we weren't suspicious - just <br/>
looked like folks who were separated from a tour group.  :)<br/>
<br/>
It turns out that this box has been abandoned and the placer has not <br/>
logged on to LbNA in 3 years.  The Web masters have moved it to the <br/>
Basement.<br/>
<br/>
We turned down an offer to adopt this box because of the long drive, <br/>
but if any of the Bucks Co boxers are interested, please contact <br/>
<a href="mailto:john@..." rel="nofollow" target="_blank">john@...</a> .  I offered to post this on their behalf.<br/>
<br/>
It might be an odd box for someone who is not a DVC alum to adopt, but <br/>
the campus is pretty.  Someone could clean up the box and the clues and <br/>
put something else in there.<br/>
