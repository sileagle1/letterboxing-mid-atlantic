<div>Mark Pepe was so upset about the crappy job people have been doing re-hiding boxes in CT that he postd this to two groups. I don't think we have that problem here but it's a good reminder for all of us to review. This area (PA,NY,NJ,MD,DE,VA) is growing by leaps and bounds so it's important to remember to treat each box as if it were our own, which I think we do. I have only ever had that problem once with any of my boxes and I make sure when I re-hide a box to walk around it from all angles and make sure I can't see anything. Perhaps there are so many boxes and boxers in CT that some folks are getting a little complacent? Who knows. Of course someone chimed in with a post that implied that it might be the newer people which really irks me no end. Anyway, we just need to remember to look out for each other, which I think we already do very well.</div>

<div>How do we handle something like this? Kerri knows who the culprit was in this case. Should she have emailed them to advise? If it were you, would you be receptive to such an email. When I first started Dan and Joyce Kelly were my mentors (Team Kelly) and they told me if I ever heard a particular group of people found my boxes, get right out and check them because these folks do not re-hide very well. I did just that and Team Kelly was right, the boxes were (almost) in plain veiw. I never said anything becaue I was new and I have met these folks and they're actually very nice. How do we handle this? I know if I did not properly re-hide a box I would not mind an email telling me so in a gentle way. <br/><br/><b><i>Kerri Paul &lt;kerripaul@...&gt;</i></b> wrote:</div>

I agree that we must do something to stop these poorly rehidden boxes. If you know who the culprits are, you should send them a "gentle" email.<br/>
<br/>
If not, the only avenue is education - education - education. <br/>
<br/>
It doesn't hurt to put a reminder in your clues - "Please rehide carefully."<br/>
Other possible remedies: This continuing problem should be brought up frequently in these talk lists, at gatherings and even while on the trail with others in your group.<br/>

Have fun and just get out there &amp; box!!!<br/>

<br/>
Her Ladyship senses the possibility of jumping to a conclusion lacking<br/>
in veracity. How can one be sure that the last person to stamp in a<br/>
logbook is responsible for the state in which the next person finds a<br/>
box? Would it not be possible that the box could have been discovered<br/>
and left along the trail by a non-boxer? It sounds as if the four of<br/>
you who have built cases based on circumstantial evidence should<br/>
perhaps confer privately to determine that you are indeed considering<br/>
the same suspect. As it is your public speculation has thrown into<br/>
question the reputation of every father and son letter boxing team in<br/>
the mid-Atlantic region. In the event that you all have come up with<br/>
the same suspect remember that your case is still based on<br/>
circumstantial evidence. <br/>
<br/>
Several of our comrades in boxing in New England have expressed the<br/>
opinion that vandalized or removed boxes often are not the target of<br/>
malicious intent or lackadaisical re-hiding but a poor hiding spot. If<br/>
you find your boxes frequently go missing ask yourself if it could be<br/>
your own fault for choosing a poor location. Her Ladyship's "Real<br/>
Story of Steam Power" box is not usually concealed as we initially<br/>
left it. This tells Her Ladyship that we should have chosen a better<br/>
spot. Her Ladyship thinks it unfair to hide a box in the middle of an<br/>
open area under some twigs and leaves then expecting it to remain<br/>
concealed. Her ladyship feels that just a tad more effort should go<br/>
into choosing the place of concealment. Consider also that these boxes<br/>
are covered in human scent which animals are keenly adapted to<br/>
locating and will expose boxes in the hope of finding food which they<br/>
have, through operant conditioning, come to associate with human<br/>
scent. Small mammals will often push and drag their uncovered<br/>
treasures about in an attempt to open the box and, lacking the<br/>
opposable pollex of the human digital appendage, leave it unopened and<br/>
distant from it's hiding spot. Perhaps your suspect merely leaves an<br/>
enticing scent on the boxes he or she finds. Her Ladyship hopes you<br/>
will temper your accusations with compassion and all due demurral to<br/>
our nations time honored principal of a presumption of innocence.<br/>
<br/>

SilentDoug's site (a blessing) and went on to check out LBNA. I read <br/>
all of the newbie stuff that I could find, bought a stamp and pad and <br/>
set out. Even in hind sight, I think that I did pretty well. However, <br/>
if I am ruining or compromising boxes, I want someone to tell me what <br/>
I'm doing wrong. I had no mentor; I have never been out with another <br/>
Letterboxer. I have never met another Letterboxer! Geez, you can <br/>
imagine how disappointed I was to miss the gathering the other week. <br/>
I use common sense and continue to read and learn from <br/>

Dan and Joyce Kelly were my mentors (Team Kelly) and they told me if <br/>
I ever heard a particular group of people found my boxes, get right <br/>

did just that and Team Kelly was right, the boxes were (almost) in <br/>

<div>My name is [first name].  I am the placer of the [name] letterbox.  I think there may be a problem with the way your group is replacing letterboxes after you visit them.  You may be unaware of how a letterbox should be carefully rehidden in the same way that it was found.  I found that my box was not rehidden after you visited it.  It was in plain sight and in danger of being discovered and removed.  </div>
<div> </div>
<div>If the letterbox is not rehidden carefully it can easily go missing or be found and discarded by the cleaning people.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>I am not positive that this involves you or your group but I have heard other reports of problems with letterboxes left in the open after your visits so I thought I would write and make sure there is not some misunderstanding.  </div>

<div>"Another possibility is that you are rehiding the box well but leaving on the box some food smell that attracts animals.  Animals have a keen sense of smell for food and often drag letterboxes out to investigate a faint food smell.  If you snack along the way and then box you may be inadvertantly leaving an enticing scent behind."</div>

How can one be sure that the last person to stamp in a<br/>logbook is responsible for the state in which the next person finds a<br/>box? Would it not be possible that the box could have been discovered<br/>and left along the trail by a non-boxer? It sounds as if the four of<br/>you who have built cases based on circumstantial evidence should<br/>perhaps confer privately to determine that you are indeed considering<br/>the same suspect. As it is your public speculation has thrown into<br/>question the reputation of every father and son letter boxing team in<br/>the mid-Atlantic region. In the event that you all have come up with<br/>the same suspect remember that your case is still based on<br/>circumstantial evidence. <br/><br/>Several of our comrades in boxing in New England have
 expressed the<br/>opinion that vandalized or removed boxes often are not the target of<br/>malicious intent or lackadaisical re-hiding but a poor hiding spot. If<br/>you find your boxes frequently go missing ask yourself if it could be<br/>your own fault for choosing a poor location. Her Ladyship's "Real<br/>Story of Steam Power" box is not usually concealed as we initially<br/>left it. This tells Her Ladyship that we should have chosen a better<br/>spot. Her Ladyship thinks it unfair to hide a box in the middle of an<br/>open area under some twigs and leaves then expecting it to remain<br/>concealed. Her ladyship feels that just a tad more effort should go<br/>into choosing the place of concealment. Consider also that these boxes<br/>are covered in human scent which animals are keenly adapted to<br/>locating and will expose boxes in the hope of finding food which they<br/>have, through operant conditioning, come to associate with human<br/>scent. Small mammals will often push and drag their
 uncovered<br/>treasures about in an attempt to open the box and, lacking the<br/>opposable pollex of the human digital appendage, leave it unopened and<br/>distant from it's hiding spot. Perhaps your suspect merely leaves an<br/>enticing scent on the boxes he or she finds. Her Ladyship hopes you<br/>will temper your accusations with compassion and all due demurral to<br/>our nations time honored principal of a presumption of innocence.<br/><br/>Respectfully submitted,<br/>Lady Prisspott<br/><br/><br/></tt><br/></blockquote><p>
