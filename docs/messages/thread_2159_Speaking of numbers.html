All Mapsurfer boxes count as 10<br/>

Please recount you finds accordingly ;-)<br/>

                    <div id="ygrps-yiv-1385969265">Actually we can tweak the numbers a bit to still make the averages be <br/>
one, but 1 MS = 10 CT is a bit low.  Perhaps 1 MS = 100 CT and 25 PA <br/>
is more appropriate?  ShredMTB's may count at 10 PA and 40 CT.<br/>
<br/>
Littleboxes are worth the same as a CT.<br/>
