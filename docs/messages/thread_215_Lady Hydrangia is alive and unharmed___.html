<div>Welcome Back!! I have been so worried about you! About two weeks ago someone posted to this list using your identity but I was sure it couldn't have been you! Please see my post titled "Ok-Who kidnapped Lady Hydrangia and what have you done with her!". And then we heard nothing for so long I could only image the worst. You were being held against your will, forced to sleep on Percale bed sheets instead of (what I assume) your usual Egyptian cotton, forced to watch game shows with your captors and drink tea made with a &gt;gasp!&lt; teabag!!!! Why I have been sick with worry. Thank goodness you are okay and here to keep us from becoming an angry village mob and turning on each other. Boy am I ever sorry I posted this one! I have had 2 father-son teams email me offlist to see if they were the folks mentioned. Argh! When will I ever learn to use caution before I open my BIG FAT MOUTH!!! </div>

Her Ladyship hasn't the faintest idea who that was. Perhaps someone<br/>
has indeed been attempting to impersonate her Ladyship. There has been<br/>
a rather suspicious and poorly dressed person who seems to be lurking<br/>
about her Ladyship. Just the other day Her Ladyship visited a favored<br/>

move. It troubled us sufficiently that we took the precaution of<br/>
having the Prisspott jewels copied in paste, we couldn't allow these<br/>
famous gems fall into the wrong hands. Her Ladyship does appreciate<br/>
