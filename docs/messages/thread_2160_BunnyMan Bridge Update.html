<br/>
so far 5 have attempted, and only 1 has survived (found)..and it was <br/>
on a second attempt....the other 4 failed due to FBI, cops, nerves, <br/>
and even the BunnyMan, himself.<br/>
<br/>
Folks feel the rush, feel the presence of the locals, feel the cops, <br/>
and feel the hair on thier neck's raise.  It seems folks get rushed by <br/>
their nerves, and swear its not there..IT is as real as THE BUNNYMAN!<br/>
<br/>
a box that will scare!</div>
