                    <div id="ygrps-yiv-1860587400">Hi everyone!  My family and I just began our letterboxing journey and <br/>
went out today and found our first letterbox.  It was the Bay <br/>
Bridge/Sandy Point letterbox and we had a wonderful time.  We had <br/>
never been to that park before and what a beautiful place!!<br/>
<br/>
My question is that we found a hitchhiker in the box.  I had read a <br/>
bit about hitchhikers and was tempted to take it with us as we're <br/>
planning on finding another letterbox tomorrow.  But since it was our <br/>
first time and wasn't completely sure about etiquette, we left it <br/>
behind.  Should we have left our stamps in the hitchhiker's logbook <br/>
or is that simply for the letterbox's that it stays with?  And is <br/>
there a way to search for info on the hitchhiker?  It did have an <br/>
email address but I forgot to write it down (we have 3 boys ages 2, <br/>
4, and 6 and since it was our first time, there was a lot to remember <br/>
to do!).  I'm assuming hitchhikers are kind of like word of mouth <br/>
boxes...not really a way to find out more.<br/>
<br/>
Another reason I didn't take the hitchhiker along is that the box <br/>
we're planning on looking for tomorrow hasn't been found yet (at <br/>
least not recorded on atlasquest.com) and I was afraid to put it <br/>
somewhere that it might not be found again.  If you pick up the <br/>
hitchhiker, are you suppose to let the owner know where you placed it <br/>
or just where you found it?<br/>
<br/>
Thanks so much for the help.  I'm very excited about this new hobby <br/>
for our family and look forward to getting to know you all.<br/>

<p>There is a HH yahoo group you might review some of the posts there for answers:<br/><a href="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/letterbox_travellers/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://groups.yahoo.com/group/letterbox_travellers/</a></p>
<p>And there is another group for newbies that might be of interest:<br/><a href="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/newboxers/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://groups.yahoo.com/group/newboxers/</a></p>
<p>Personally, I think you should only stamp in a HH if you are taking it with you to move along.  Whether you leave it in a popular box or an obscure box makes no difference.  I also report to the planter where I found it (if I can remember) and where I left it.  Not sure what info they post on the HH talk list.</p>
<p>Well, you have certainly found the right activity for family fun.</p>
