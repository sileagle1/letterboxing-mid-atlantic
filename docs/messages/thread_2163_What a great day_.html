Buckaroo Banzai and I were there at about 1230 or<br/>
!:00. We also stopped by the Art store in search of<br/>
pink stuff. <br/>
After lunch we found Specific Gavity, or at least<br/>
Mambo Dog found it, I was looking under thee wrong<br/>
tree.<br/>
We spent the AM up at Tyler planting CSN&amp;Y. Took a<br/>
look at the fire pit area. No one was using it.<br/>
WARNING for next week end Mambo Dog has big plans for<br/>
a series he is working on. He's got some evil ideas<br/>
and some decent stamps. We shall see. <br/>
Also Mambo Dog is a Boy Scout and his troop sells<br/>
wreaths as a fund raiser. We will have wreaths with us<br/>
if any one is interested. $20 for a lg., $15 for a med<br/>
and $12 for a swag. If you purchase one you will get a<br/>
special stamp. Must start carving.<br/>

&gt;      Well crap! What time were at Issac's? Mambo<br/>
&gt; Dog,<br/>
&gt; Buckaroo Banzai and I were there at about 1230 or<br/>
&gt; !:00. We also stopped by the Art store in search of<br/>
&gt; pink stuff. <br/>
&gt; After lunch we found Specific Gavity, or at least<br/>
&gt; Mambo Dog found it, I was looking under thee wrong<br/>
&gt; tree.<br/>
&gt; We spent the AM up at Tyler planting CSN&amp;Y. Took a<br/>
&gt; look at the fire pit area. No one was using it.<br/>
&gt; WARNING for next week end Mambo Dog has big plans<br/>
&gt; for<br/>
&gt; a series he is working on. He's got some evil ideas<br/>
&gt; and some decent stamps. We shall see. <br/>
&gt; Also Mambo Dog is a Boy Scout and his troop sells<br/>
&gt; wreaths as a fund raiser. We will have wreaths with<br/>
&gt; us<br/>
&gt; if any one is interested. $20 for a lg., $15 for a<br/>
&gt; med<br/>
&gt; and $12 for a swag. If you purchase one you will get<br/>
&gt; a<br/>
&gt; special stamp. Must start carving.<br/>
