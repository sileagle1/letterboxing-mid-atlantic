                    <div id="ygrps-yiv-688157663">I have been contacted by a local public television reporter who <br/>
wants to do a piece on letterboxing. I know a lot of people are <br/>
afraid of publicity. But I think public television, and only local, <br/>
is a good demographic for some letterboxing publicity. I wouldn't <br/>
agree to help if it was a regular network news show. <br/>
<br/>
They want to film a couple of people hunting for the Orion letterbox <br/>
in DC. No problem with permission since it is my box. <br/>
<br/>
They are looking for letterboxers who have not already found Orion <br/>
so they can film them finding the box. The tentative shoot date is <br/>
next Tuesday morning, December 5th. This is subject to weather and <br/>
schedule changes. They do not need experienced letterboxers. Newbies <br/>
might even be better. They say it is not a "family" show so they are <br/>
looking for adults and not kids. They would prefer to film a couple <br/>
of people working together. <br/>
<br/>
Another possibillity would be for me to rehide the box and alter the <br/>
clues, so that even if you've found Orion before you can do it <br/>
again. (I plan to carve a new stamp.)<br/>
<br/>
If you are interested, or have someone to recommend, please write me <br/>
off list. I know this is a weekday and that is difficult. If you <br/>
know someone willing but only available on a weekend let me know <br/>
that too. <br/>

they intrepidly search for this piece of plastic in the heartland of <br/>
the beltway.<br/>

I am going to slightly rewrite and replant Orion. Enough that it <br/>
will seem "new" for the filming. So we now can include someone who <br/>

We are looking for a couple of adults, experienced or newbies, with <br/>

<br/>
Weather and crew schedule permitting we are still planning on next <br/>
