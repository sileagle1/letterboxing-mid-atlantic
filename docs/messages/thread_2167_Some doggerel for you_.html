poem.  Geckospot encouraged me to post it here for you fine folks to <br/>
enjoy.  Here you go!<br/>
<br/>
I made a little letterbox.<br/>
The stamp came out so fine.<br/>
In great detail I carved it out,<br/>
And didn't miss a line.<br/>
<br/>
I made a little letterbox.<br/>
The log's a work of art.<br/>
I've double-bagged it in the box;<br/>
It shouldn't fall apart.<br/>
<br/>
I made a little letterbox.<br/>
The hiding place is pretty!<br/>
A scenic hike, a county park<br/>
Not too far from the city.<br/>
<br/>
I made a little letterbox.<br/>
The clues I wrote are hard,<br/>
(THAT should keep the noobs away.)<br/>
In verse form  I'm a bard!<br/>
<br/>
I made a little letterbox.<br/>
Shall I post it on AQ?<br/>
But what if someone seeks it out<br/>
Who don't know what to do?<br/>
<br/>
I made a little letterbox.<br/>
Off-line I'll keep the clues!<br/>
So only those who contact me<br/>
Will get location news.<br/>
<br/>
What if that's not secure enough?<br/>
I'm frightened for it now.<br/>
What if the baggie goes unsealed?<br/>
What if it's eaten by a cow?<br/>
<br/>
What if a band of newbies<br/>
With kids and dogs in tow<br/>
Shout out "I found the letterbox!"<br/>
For all the world to know?<br/>
<br/>
What if they're more experienced,<br/>
But careless just one time?<br/>
What if the lid's not put on right<br/>
And the box fills up with grime?<br/>
<br/>
I guess I could go postal<br/>
And mail it around.<br/>
But even then it could get lost!<br/>
No, that idea's not sound.<br/>
<br/>
I made a little letterbox.<br/>
It's sitting on my shelf.<br/>
The world's a big and scary place.<br/>
I'll just keep it for myself.<br/>

Those are the exact words I was seeking throughout the whole flame <br/>

In fact the box that I shall make for Irene's log collection will be <br/>

<div>Yes, I do agree it was impolite to chastise us for being so dimwitted for still using the 'net to post clues. Perhaps this person felt the were being helpful in their own bizarre way, but unlikely. Unfortunately, politeness and good manners are optional in this hobby.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Someone else mused that if this person was so anti-internet, and seems to dislike all but a handful of people on the talk list, why do they even subscribe or post there? What not take your self, along with all of your clues offline. Again, I agree with the whole bad manners assesment, but the chat list is to post ideas and discuss various aspects of letterboxing, even those we might find smug or rude. Or just plain disagree with.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>It took me a couple of years but I have gotten over getting upset and angry with those folks. They are people I will most likely never meet, nor box with. So I don't give a fat rat's patootie with the heck they do with there boxes and clues. Am just glad they are so far away from me. But even if they weren't I could care less. There are so many great folks in this hobby, I am not going to let a handful of smug old-heads who are legends in their own minds take any of my joy away.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>So to summarize...it was a great poem!</div>

&gt; <br/>
&gt; I made a little letterbox.<br/>
&gt; The stamp came out so fine.<br/>
&gt; In great detail I carved it out,<br/>

&gt; <br/>
&gt; I made a little letterbox.<br/>
&gt; The hiding place is pretty!<br/>
&gt; A scenic hike, a county park<br/>
&gt; Not too far from the city.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I made a little letterbox.<br/>
&gt; The clues I wrote are hard,<br/>
&gt; (THAT should keep the noobs away.)<br/>
&gt; In verse form  I'm a bard!<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I made a little letterbox.<br/>
&gt; Shall I post it on AQ?<br/>
&gt; But what if someone seeks it out<br/>
&gt; Who don't know what to do?<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I made a little letterbox.<br/>
&gt; Off-line I'll keep the clues!<br/>
&gt; So only those who contact me<br/>
&gt; Will get location news.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; What if that's not secure enough?<br/>
&gt; I'm frightened for it now.<br/>
&gt; What if the baggie goes unsealed?<br/>
&gt; What if it's eaten by a cow?<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; What if a band of newbies<br/>
&gt; With kids and dogs in tow<br/>
&gt; Shout out "I found the letterbox!"<br/>
&gt; For all the world to know?<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; What if they're more experienced,<br/>
&gt; But careless just one time?<br/>
&gt; What if the lid's not put on right<br/>
&gt; And the box fills up with grime?<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I guess I could go postal<br/>
&gt; And mail it around.<br/>
&gt; But even then it could get lost!<br/>
&gt; No, that idea's not sound.<br/>
&gt; <br/>

</span></blockquote>I think you nailed it on the head Maryann.  I think most here are in the <br/>
"Your box, your choice" crowd, but when we create boxes, we actually <br/>
want people to find them (well, at least be able to try).  The whole <br/>
issue, as I see it, is there are a certain few who have boxes, choose to <br/>
make them WOM (which is fine), but then say, "well, I have this box, but <br/>
YOU are not good enough to have the clues."  If that is the case, I <br/>
don't want the clues.  Screw that, there are plenty of boxes out there, <br/>
I don't need that person's box.<br/>
<br/>
This cuts to another issue, that there are a few people out there that <br/>
think letterboxing should be how it was at the begining, in '98.<br/>
<br/>
Well, it isn't, that is just the way it is.  Does it mean that new boxes <br/>
are not clever, thought provoking, fun?  No.  And if they don't see <br/>
that, they are just plain stupid and don't pay attention.  When you look <br/>
at clues, like say the Bowery Mission boxes (to point one out), you <br/>
can't help but be impressed by the work that has gone into them.  And <br/>
there are a ton more just like that out there.<br/>
<br/>
Boxes come in all shapes, sizes, and difficulties, and that, in my never <br/>
humble opinion, is a good thing.  I am glad that a family like the <br/>
Rosens, who we met last weekend, and go out, have  a nice day in the <br/>
park with the kids, and find something in the woods, while at the same <br/>
time people like the Hairyleggers can be challenged to find the most <br/>
difficult of boxes.  There is something for everyone, and that is one of <br/>
the things that makes it great.<br/>
<br/>
Well, I could write a few more pages, but I must be off, and will be out <br/>
for a few days, so you kids be good.<br/>
