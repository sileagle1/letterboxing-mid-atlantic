<br/>
On Sunday, 4 February 07, I will join the Lewes Polar Bears for the <br/>
11th consecutive year.  At 1:00 PM, we will hit the Atlantic Ocean at <br/>
Rehoboth Beach, Delaware.<br/>
<br/>
Yeah, it's probably a bad idea - I have run through snow and ice in <br/>
previous years, tend to turn pink from head to toe, and feel cold for <br/>
most of the rest of the day.<br/>
<br/>
It's a bad idea for a good cause, though.  Last year, 2390 Bears <br/>
raised over $420,000 for Special Olympics Delaware.<br/>
<br/>
I'd much rather run into 35-degree water than ask for donations, even <br/>
for a great cause like this, so this is my pitch.<br/>
<br/>
Here's my official donation Web site:<br/>

<br/>
Syner and I will be at the "Playing in the Band" gathering this <br/>
coming Saturday, and I will offer a stamp to anyone who contributes <br/>
any amount to Special Olympics Delaware, at the gathering or at <br/>
another time.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks much!<br/>

Anyone coming should plan for a crowd.  Aside from the 2,000 or so <br/>
Bears plus support folks, we draw about 10,000 spectators.  It's like <br/>
a summer beach weekend - easily takes us an hour to get out of town <br/>
afterward  :)<br/>
