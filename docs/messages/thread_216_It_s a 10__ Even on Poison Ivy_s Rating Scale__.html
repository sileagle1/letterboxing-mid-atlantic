<div> </div>
<div>I just found tonight after work (the addiction is getting worse and worse...this was after an 11 hour day no less) two of the best boxes I have ever seen! Fleur de Lis "Ben Franklin - Scientist" and "Ben Franklin Stateman" are just wonderful. The logs are so cool, and the stamps are excellent. I only was able to get the first two and was running out of light as Dude and I were running out of the park. I can't wait to find the rest! </div>
<div> </div>
<div>Fleur, my only suggestion is I think you have the name of the road wrong. The entrance is on Winchester and Old Newton. I believe the clue says Woodward or something? I didn't notice that Winchester changed names anywhere but I could be wrong.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Oh, and wear long light pants if you have them. Lot's and lot's of stinging nettle for Scientist. </div>
<div> </div>
<div>Great boxes!! Can't wait to get the rest, stinging nettle and all! </div>

been meaning to get out and change the Tupperware, but..I guess <br/>
they're still okay :)<br/>
<br/>
As for the road..you just entered farther up I think. I triple-<br/>
checked the signs - where I parked was definitely Woodward and Old <br/>
Newtown (and yes, there was a 2nd "w" in the "Newtown"). It's about a <br/>
block away, I guess, from Winchester...?<br/>
<br/>
Thanks again, you've made my night! :)<br/>
