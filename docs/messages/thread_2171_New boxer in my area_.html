office at lunchtime logging my finds.  Kelley, a teacher who works <br/>
with the Shakespeare Festival on our education programs, stopped by <br/>
and asked me about my log, so I told her about the hobby.  She was <br/>
interested, and asked me to email her some links.<br/>
<br/>
I didn't hear back about it from her, but then last week, when we <br/>
were talking about a study guide she is preparing for us, she told <br/>
me she had bought a carving kit and downloaded some clues and was <br/>
taking her hubby and 2 kids out over the weekend to box!  She'd made <br/>
sig stamps for herself and the kids, and they were all excited about <br/>
it.<br/>
<br/>
She called again on Monday to say that they had a blast!  The kids <br/>
are already bugging her about going out again, and even her husband <br/>
(grudgingly) admitted to having a good time.  PLUS - they planted a <br/>
box!<br/>
<br/>
So I ran out yesterday morning before work to snag it...seems she's <br/>
a better boxer than I, because I couldn't find it!  Couldn't figure <br/>
out the last little bit in her clues.  I need to call or email her <br/>
and tell her that she is smarter than me...well, either that, or <br/>
it's gone missing already.  The spot where I THINK it was planted is <br/>
a pretty exposed area (a rocky hillside right next to a parking <br/>
lot).  We shall see.  <br/>
<br/>
Here's the link, in case you are interested... fun clues; needed a <br/>
little googling around to fill in the blanks.<br/>

Ok, I should do some actual work now...TTFN!<br/>
