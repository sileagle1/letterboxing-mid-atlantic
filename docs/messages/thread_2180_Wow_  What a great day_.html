day at the Playing in the Band gathering in Tyler State Park, <br/>
Newtown, PA.  It was so good to see many of the same people we met at <br/>
Boxtoberfest IV and a whole lot of people we have never met before.  <br/>
The company was great, the food was great, the stamps were <br/>
great...need I say more? <br/>
<br/>
Irene, you really did a wonderful job!  The whole family enjoyed it!  <br/>
It was nice to meet Mr. Irene in person too.<br/>
<br/>
Dude, thanks for letting my kids take you for a walk.  All I've heard <br/>
this afternoon was how much my kids want a dog, but I think we'll <br/>
just come and play with you once in a while if that's okay.<br/>
<br/>
Special thanks to Mambo Dog who was extremely patient with my son <br/>
Tommy.  He really enjoyed working through your "Joker's Hand" clues <br/>
(thank you for your help) and loves the stamps.  Tommy has already <br/>
asked if you will be at the next gathering.  He had a lot of fun with <br/>
you this afternoon.<br/>
<br/>
And of course it was great to celebrate two special occasions today.  <br/>
Happy Birthday Jan! (Team Little Dog)  Also, Happy 1st Anniversary to <br/>
Psychiker and Syner!  And many, many happy returns to all of you!  <br/>
Thanks for letting us share in your special day.<br/>
<br/>
Hope to see you all again real soon!<br/>

It's great when there are kids at a gather who want to walk him. Usually we get in our car, drive to a gather with him panting in the back seat all the way from excitement.Tthen we get there and he has to lay around a pavilion all day while his Mom socializes and maybe does a little boxing if he's lucky. So when there are kids to walk him he has a much better time. Thanks to all of the
 younger boxers who made such a fuss over him.

so, esp Leafcutter for keeping b#3 out of the river, Brian for picking <br/>
up b#3 after a muddy spill, all of those who patiently boxed with our <br/>
slow and loud little band, and everyone who was kind enough to ask b#2 <br/>
for his personal traveller and/or exchange with him.  He met more <br/>
people than I did!  And of course the biggest thank you goes to HnH <br/>
for pulling it all together in the first place.<br/>

My husband pointed out that we stayed way later than we intended -- we <br/>
all chalked it up to having such a good time.  The hours truly just <br/>
flew past.  I have put next year on our calendar, basketball or no <br/>
basketball.  <br/>

one.  I was already ecstatic that I would be spending it with the<br/>
Milkmonster but it worked out so nicely that I also got to spend it<br/>
with so many of my friends.  <br/>
<br/>
Irene, the gathering was great, as usual.  I love the casualness of<br/>
your get togethers, no pressure to do anything.   Don't get me wrong,<br/>
I love the carefully choreographed gatherings also but yours are<br/>
always so relaxing....except for the chasing the Milkmonster part.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks to Pink Panther and her parents for the cake and the sweet<br/>
presents.  And a big, big thanks to Irene for the wonderful birthday<br/>
stamp which has now become my personal traveller.  I hope everyone<br/>
asks for it so that I can show it off.<br/>

PS  Just wanted to add that I am really happy to see that there really<br/>
is a Mr. Irene.  After all these years of boxing with Hikers and<br/>
Hounds, I was totally convinced he was a figment of her imagination.<br/>

stamp to celebrate the day.  It was just a great day in a nice place <br/>
with some very nice folks.<br/>
<br/>
We're just home from Little CT, where we spent the day finding <br/>
boxes.  We saw some incredible carves and hides out there - <br/>
especially loved the Police box and our first-ever accidental find <br/>
("Hey, that looks like a letterbox!").  We are proud to say that <br/>
we're the first finders on Dude's Lava Lamp, which is a great stamp!<br/>
<br/>
My family moved from Richboro in 1984, and this was my first trip <br/>
back since then.  It was amazing to see my old house - those streets <br/>
and hills seemed so much larger once upon a time...<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, thanks again so much for sharing our anniversary.<br/>

amusing place to be, I'm so glad we finally got to meet many of the <br/>
people who have been keeping me interested in boxing.  Not the least <br/>
of whom was H&amp;H - thanks so much for organizing a gathering close <br/>
enough for us to emerge from our kingdom of lurkdom - we had fun <br/>
storming the castle.  Must confess that there were so many people &amp; <br/>
so many other goings on that we missed out on meeting lots of other <br/>
people, but I'm sure we'll make other gatherings.  <br/>
<br/>
btw, Queen B, the maze is in the little barn &amp; it is way cool for the <br/>
kids, albeit muddy.  <br/>
<br/>
thanks again everyone for being so considerate to the newbies.  <br/>

All of the desserts were good as well, the brownies, the other<br/>

That was a LB and PP boxing expedition? I thought it was a search and<br/>

friends<br/>

little sleepy<br/>

&gt; LB &amp; PP, thanks for letting me crash your boxing expeditions.<br/>

&gt; &gt; Thanks to all who bought wreaths and to all who<br/>
&gt; &gt; participated in Mambo Dog's boxes. He's getting to tha<br/>

&gt; &gt; or not want anything to do with it. These little<br/>
&gt; &gt; projects keep his interested. Plus he and I have a<br/>

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Irene, you really did a wonderful job! The whole<br/>

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; It was nice to meet Mr. Irene in person too.<br/>

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Dude, thanks for letting my kids take you for a<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; walk. All I've<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; heard<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; this afternoon was how much my kids want a dog,<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; but I think we'll<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; just come and play with you once in a while if<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; that's okay.<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Special thanks to Mambo Dog who was extremely<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; patient with my son<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Tommy. He really enjoyed working through your<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; "Joker's Hand" clues<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; (thank you for your help) and loves the stamps.<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; Tommy has already<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; asked if you will be at the next gathering. He<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; had a lot of fun<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; with<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; you this afternoon.<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; And of course it was great to celebrate two<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; special occasions<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; today.<br/>

taken an interest in it lately.  Which is great, makes my life a <br/>
