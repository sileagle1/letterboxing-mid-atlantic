<div><font face="Arial" size="2">Looks like Dave and I will be taking a short trip 
to DE with my Mom to visit her cousin. It will be 11th to 13th of this 
month. I think that she lives in Milford. Once I have the itinery down, I'll 
check the AQ and Letterboxing.org sites for boxes. Any must sees? Don't want to 
crowd the list with this, so contact me off list.</font></div>

<div><font face="Arial" size="2">Hey, Dave and I just wanted to thank all the 
placers of the boxes we got to visit in DE and MD last month. What a blast! 20 
boxes out of 20 boxes! I kept thinking - this will be the one that's missing and 
then there it is! We came home and did maintenance on our Rome Point Series and 
were rewarded with finding another box in that park. Then on a return trip to 
NJ, we thought we'd try for our first NY box. So, we looked in the clues for 
something off of 287 (we avoid the city when ever possible) and thought the 
Stony Point box looked interesting (Dave is a history nut). Unfortunately, 
it was finally payback for all those finds in DE! No box, even though we _did_ 
find the little plot of land!</font></div>
<div><font face="Arial" size="2">Perhaps the next time Dave and I are in the car 
together on the NJ/RI run and it's daylight - we'll try for another NY 
box.</font></div>
