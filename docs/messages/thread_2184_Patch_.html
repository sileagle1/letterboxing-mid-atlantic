&gt; &gt; Well, KPI is our team name, which consists of<br/>
&gt; myself, my lady <br/>
&gt; &gt; friend, and my son.  Our initials are KPI, which<br/>
&gt; is also a term I <br/>
&gt; &gt; use at work, short for "Key Performance<br/>
&gt; Indicators."  I am a manager <br/>
&gt; &gt; of a telemarketing office with 150 emloyees, thus<br/>
&gt; the term, it deals <br/>
&gt; &gt; with metrics used to gauge performance.  We're<br/>
&gt; working on our <br/>
&gt; &gt; individual stamps and trail names right now, the<br/>
&gt; lady friend is <br/>
&gt; &gt; using "Pippi" cuz she has flaming red hair, I am<br/>
&gt; using "Mr. Yuk", <br/>
&gt; &gt; cuz I think it will make a cool stamp (and is a<br/>
&gt; lot shorter than Key <br/>
&gt; &gt; Performance Indicators), and my son, who is 5,<br/>
&gt; wants to be a pirate <br/>
&gt; &gt; or a ninja (imagine that.)  I am also planning a<br/>
&gt; gather that will be <br/>
&gt; &gt; announced in the local newspaper, it will be a<br/>
&gt; workshop to get <br/>
&gt; &gt; people interested in letterboxing in the area. I'd<br/>
&gt; like the <br/>
&gt; &gt; Pittsburgh area to become sorta like the Tyler<br/>
&gt; State Park area, <br/>
&gt; &gt; where it seems you could store enough food to<br/>
&gt; serve a battalion with <br/>
&gt; &gt; all the tupperware lying about.  I will do like a<br/>
&gt; two hour tutorial <br/>
&gt; &gt; on the basics, and provide clues to a freshly<br/>
&gt; planted letterbox just <br/>
&gt; &gt; for the event.  SO, I've rambled enough now.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; Hikers and Hounds, as soon as you get those<br/>
&gt; patches made, let me <br/>
&gt; &gt; know, I'll ship you off a check immediately, (that<br/>
&gt; is if I don't <br/>
&gt; &gt; come out to your area first)<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>

this is such a good idea.  If I am approached by a newspaper or TV, I am <br/>
fine, but I don't think going out and looking for publicity is the right <br/>
way to go about it.<br/>
<br/>
What I would suggest you do, instead of having a workshop that you <br/>
advertise, start to work with your local parks.  Really get to know the <br/>
ins and outs of the hobby as well as the ins and outs of how the parks <br/>
in your area work, and then if one of the parks wants to do something, <br/>
set it up through them.  This is a slower approach, but in the long run <br/>
a better one.<br/>

There are a lot of new boxes in your area, I noticed that from looking <br/>
just last week, though I had no time to go hunting.  Maybe early next <br/>
year I will take a trip out (I even picked out "my room" in my friend's <br/>
new house) and get some heavy duty boxing done.<br/>

I guess I'll have to think of a better idea than newspapers, It's a <br/>
good thing I put the idea out here first.<br/>
<br/>
It just seems to me that it would be hard to grow letterboxing in an <br/>
area if some new, likeminded people don't get involved.<br/>
<br/>
Are you folks postulating that a gather of current letterboxes would <br/>
renew/keep/grow interest in the sport, thus result in more activity in <br/>
the area?<br/>
<br/>
The thing that I find funny about this is that the newspaper idea was <br/>
so abhorrent that noone even asked me something like "OMG, you manage <br/>
a telemarketing center?"<br/>

</span></blockquote>Gathers do keep us renewed and intersted. A gather<br/>
doesn't have to be complicated or elaborate to draw<br/>
local boxers. Although I really enjoyed the DE games<br/>
and Pub crawl in VA. Here in the PA area someone says<br/>
gather and we say where. It seems we'll drop everthing<br/>
for an excuse to get together. At the 1st Battle of<br/>
the bands gather there were only a handful of us. This<br/>
year Irene had 40 signups! Post it on Atlasquest and<br/>
see what happens.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Are you folks postulating that a gather of current<br/>
&gt; letterboxes would <br/>
&gt; renew/keep/grow interest in the sport, thus result<br/>
&gt; in more activity in <br/>
&gt; the area?<br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>

<br/>
