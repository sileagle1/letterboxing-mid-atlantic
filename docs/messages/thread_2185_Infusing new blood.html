                    <div id="ygrps-yiv-1639258385">I was wondering what experiences folks have had with park representatives. We were looking for a box that required a clue from a brass plaque on an historic building. As we were looking at the plaque, a man drove up in a Chevy Blazer with no distinguishing characteristics (neither the man nor the Blazer). He said, "What are you doing there?" I replied, "Who wants to know?" The man identified himself, with official badge and all, as the Park Manager. So since the directions for this particular box said it was placed with permission, we felt comfortable telling him we were looking for the box, and needed a clue from the plaque. He seemed upset and proceeded to say that he wished they hadn't chosed this spot because if people happen to drive by and see people reading the historic marker on the public building, someone would probably come back and steal it. Now correct me if I'm wrong, but aren't these brass markers put there for the education of the public, and we're SUPPOSED to look at them??<br/>
<br/>
Which brings me to my next question. I like the idea of working with park folks to plant a few boxes, and maybe hold some informal events both for seasoned boxers and to introduce new folks to the fun. How do you think this would fly with the park people? If they were cooperative, I think this would be a great way to infuse new boxing blood into an area.<br/>

the kids know not to read the plaques anymore!  This is not a <br/>
learning opportunity...move along children.<br/>
<br/>
I think working w/ the park officials is a great idea, maybe not at <br/>
that park, though!  Before we heard about letterboxing, we'd <br/>
frequently pick up flyers on park activities of the parks we frequent <br/>
(Ft. Washington SP, Lackawanna SP to name a couple) &amp; we'd plan on <br/>
activities that piqued our interest.  I suspect a well phrased <br/>
summary would interest those people who might like lbing long-term.  <br/>

been happening - maybe just had a round of vandalism or other <br/>
nastiness, maybe he was just having a rough day.<br/>
<br/>
In terms of reaching out to parks, I'm sure that other folks have <br/>
good ideas and better stories, but I think that it can be delicate.  <br/>
DE State Parks have an established state-wide procedure for obtaining <br/>
approval to plant a box, and it seems like some rangers or supers <br/>
surf the Web for unapproved boxes in their parks, so there's much to <br/>
be said for being straightforward.<br/>
<br/>
I don't think that PA State Parks have a procedure, at least state-<br/>
wide, so it varies from place to place.<br/>
<br/>
I guess that I'm thinking that if there are no established rules then <br/>
you can reach out - maybe get the manager interested and informed <br/>
about the hobby - but then you also risk a strong adverse reaction to <br/>
something that could otherwise have happened quietly and without <br/>
trouble.  I'm a supervisor and my staff may do some things that I <br/>
don't approve, but I'm not worried about that until I learn about <br/>
them - no time to go pulling everything apart looking for trouble.<br/>
