All of us, everyone one of us, understand your enthusiasm. When I first learned about letterboxing I just couldn't believe people weren't shouting it from the rooftops! I wanted to!! But then as I boxed more and planted, and read up on the hobby I began to see the need to be careful and selective when spreading the word. I have participated in publicity, much to the chagrine of some dear friends on this list, and with the blessing of others. But it was to a small audience all 3 times. As I planted and lost boxes I began to worry, like everyone else, about how and why they were being lost. Who lost them, was it those pesky folks from ABC article or XYZ TV/Radio program, vandals, bad planting or bad luck?!?! It was probably a little of everything but mostly the last two. </div> <div> </div> <div>There were some great ideas posted here, start
 small (with a local park), host a gather. Plenty of us will jump in a car and drive several hours to attend a gather, I know I will! We will also carve and donate boxes to you if you need us to that you can plant for your gather. We do it all the time.</div> <div> </div> <div>When I saw your first post I must admit I did LOL at the telemarketing thing (oh no! right in the middle of dinner!) and then graoned at the real explanation of your trail name, KPI. As a corporate trainer to a large call center I deal with KPI's all day long! Which is why I love being in the woods so much. Letterboxing lets me leave it all behind.</div> <div> </div> <div>So welcome to LBMA, I hope you're not sorry I invited you to join us! Your first post and we get all worked up, too funny! But we are usually pretty good natured and well mannered and hopefully you found that in the messages you read today. I thought everyone did a great job explaining their points of view. It was a
 very useful discussion and one that will come up time and time again.</div> <div> </div> <div>So...when are we all heading to P'burg? Oh that's right, you're heading out this way in a week or so. When is that?</div> <div> </div> <div>H&amp;H<br/><br/><b><i>kpiletterbox &lt;kpiletterbox@...&gt;</i></b> wrote:</div> <blockquote><span title="qreply"> <blockquote class="ygrps-yiv-1314434093replbq" style="PADDING-LEFT:5px;MARGIN-LEFT:5px;BORDER-LEFT:#1010ff 2px solid;"> <div id="ygrps-yiv-1314434093ygrp-text"> <div>Put it up to youthful enthusiasm.
