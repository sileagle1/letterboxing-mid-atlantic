<div>Hello, folks!  My name's Mike, and I'm a new letterboxer, living in the Maryland burbs of Washington, DC.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>This past weekend I carved my first stamp, and yesterday I found my first box!  I was actually pretty excited, to tell the truth.  It had all sounded like fun, but actually finding a physical box made it all real!  Now I can't wait to uncover more.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Anyway, I just wanted to say hello, and express my hopes of meeting more letterboxers in the near future.</div>

to meet the locals, and not so loco.<br/>

<div> </div>
<div>I remember how excited I was to find my first box.  I was sooo excited.  I remember how excited I was to find my last box.  That was tonight.  It was really cool.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>I look forward to seeing your stamps around, maybe running into you on the trail or meeting you at a gather.  </div>
<div> </div>
<div>Ask a lot of questions.</div>
