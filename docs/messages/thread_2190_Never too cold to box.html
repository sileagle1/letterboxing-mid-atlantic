cold, and windy, and cold, but we found all that we searched out.<br/>
<br/>
We started with the Neshaminy HHH.  I let her follow the clues and I <br/>
just tagged along.<br/>
<br/>
Afterwards we headed over to Bensalem Central Park and the Super Hero <br/>
Series, all of which we found in good shape.  The last box of the series <br/>
was a bit tricky, and were it not for Sheba, I don't think I would have <br/>
figured it out.<br/>
<br/>
Off to Armstrong Park, we picked up the Creepy Crawlers series.  The <br/>
boxes were all close together, so we grabbed them all at once, stamped <br/>
in in the car, and then replanted them.  Of course, we had to stamp the <br/>
tick in blue ;-)<br/>
<br/>
Deb, there was a big spider in the last box, but don't worry, we killed <br/>
it for you.<br/>
<br/>
All of the stamps are very nicely done.  Guess I better do some work and <br/>
get some more boxes in the township.<br/>
