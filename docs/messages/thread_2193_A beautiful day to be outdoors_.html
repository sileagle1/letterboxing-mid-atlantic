We stayed over at our friends in Newark and then headed up to Valley Garden Park, one of my favorite places on the planet, to do some maintenance and boxing. Re-vamped "Long Strange Trip" series, added 2 more boxes to it, Truckin' and Playing in the Band-the event stamp from last weekends gather. Grabbed the wedding box in there but ran out of steam before we got Under the Fairy Moon and FOO's box (Friends of Otis). Which means Dude and I must head back ASAP after the holidays to get those 2 plus all of the new ones popping up all over the area.</div> <div> </div> <div>Every time I do maintenance on these boxes, I run into boxers. This time it was the Chambers family from Hockessin out enjoying the day. They are newer boxers brought in by the Family Fun article and were so much fun to chat and exchange with. I have invited them to join us on this list and hope to see
 them here soon.</div> <div> </div> <div>I see the list was very quiet today so hopefully everyone was busy enjoying themselves on way or another. Take care and box softly!</div> <div> </div> <div>H&amp;H</div><p>

</span></blockquote>I actually went out yesterday, and since Trogdor<br/>
wanted to sleep in, I did a solo trip way out west to<br/>
Montgomery County, MD.  Had an absolutely lovely day<br/>
of near-solitude, exploring a couple of parks courtesy<br/>
of Yachty Girl and the Energizer Bunnie.<br/>
<br/>
I did come across one "murder" scene.  Climbed up a<br/>
hill for a "Far, Far, Away" box and came across a<br/>
ziplock bag, chewed into pieces.  Came around the log<br/>
and found a second ziplock bag, similarly torn and<br/>
chewed.  Then there was a tupperware lid.  Then the<br/>
bottom of the box ten feet away.  And nestled in the<br/>
oak leaves, the logbook, fortunately not too mangled<br/>
and not too damp.  Couldn't ever find the Donkey<br/>
stamp, although it might have been there in the leaves<br/>
somewhere.  Or in the gullet of a  ...was that the<br/>
lingering scent of eau de SKUNK?<br/>
<br/>
My first crime scene, and it was shocking.<br/>
