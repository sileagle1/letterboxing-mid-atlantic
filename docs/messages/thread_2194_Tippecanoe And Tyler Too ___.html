</span></blockquote>Your mind is going just a mile a minute, huh.  To find a link between <br/>
these two subjects is, well, interesting.<br/>
<br/>
Speaking of Tippacanoe, I was there just last August.  It is in <br/>
Battleground, IN (great name for a town).  They have a nice little <br/>
museum, and yes there is one letterbox there.  It is along the lines of <br/>
the infamous shark, the box has nothing to do with the location, and is <br/>
instead a frog, though a nice hand carved one.<br/>
<br/>
If I get back next year perhaps I will find the time to plant one more <br/>
appropraite to the significance of the location.<br/>
