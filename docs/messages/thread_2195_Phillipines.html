for years on my way to work, I can just imagine a carload of Red Hat <br/>
Boxers piling out with various backpacks, boxes and other assorted <br/>
gear in tow.  Contrary to what June says, I don't think there's <br/>
really an age limit in the biz -- you probably would have been <br/>
inundated with offers on your way in the door!<br/>

Wow! See, the trouble is, if I carve a stamp like that, no one will
ever believe it's a real critter! (But I'll do it anyway - we're near
Richmond, and what better place for the Official Virginia State Mammal
Stamp... ;-&gt;)<br/>
Hee, hee!<br/>
Thanks for the idea, H&amp;H!<br/>

Glad to hear you'll be in a position to hunt this box in the near
future. We planted it as far north as we could to make it more
accessible for you. A word to the wise - if you're going to be reaching
the box by crossing the Nice Bridge from MD into VA, they charge $3 to
leave the state. Interesting, that - you can enter MD for free, but you
have to pay to get out. Seems a bit like a compound with the
barbed/razor wire pointing inwards, doesn't it?<br/>
EllBee<br/>
PS: Off to update the clues with the $3 info...<br/>
