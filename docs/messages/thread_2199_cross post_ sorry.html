announced that they are eliminating the fabric department from 2800<br/>
stores (including the one near me!!!). I know a lot of people don't<br/>
agree with Wal-mart's policies but for those of us living on the edge<br/>
of oblivion it's our only choice. Now if I need last minute sewing<br/>
notions or cheap $1/yard fabric for covering log books I'll have to<br/>
drive an hour. If Wal-mart goes out of the fabric business that leaves<br/>
JoAnn's with a near monopoly and if you ask me they're far worse.<br/>
Without competition JoAnn's already high prices will shoot up. I know<br/>
this isn't directly related to letterboxing but I know there are a lot<br/>
of crafty people here who shop at Walmart for supplies. If you are as<br/>
distressed about this developement as I am let them know that you<br/>
don't want them to close their fabric departmants call (1-800-walmart)<br/>
