I just wanted to let everyone know that if you were planning on getting <br/>
my Hanukkah series tomorrow at Starbucks-- I had to cancel the special <br/>
letterbox.  We had a family emergency and I have to go out of state in <br/>
the morning.  I am sorry if anyone was planning on attending.  Happy <br/>
