Lockwench where the link was after she posted about it. That probably means<br/>
that other people didn't know where it was either. And........like I<br/>
pointed out, there is nothing about it on the homepage of AQ so anyone<br/>
logging onto AQ won't know about it unless they happen to see it on the AQ<br/>
board if they even go there, or unless someone happens to mention it to<br/>
them. All the other features and changes on AQ have been prominently<br/>
displayed but not this vote. I want people to know there is a vote and to<br/>
vote, one way or the other. <br/>
