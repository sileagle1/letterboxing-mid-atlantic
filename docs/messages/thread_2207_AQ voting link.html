to call it. I'm pretty sure he could have put the voting on the front page<br/>
and made it available only to registered members if he had wanted to do it<br/>
that way. All it takes is some code. He could have created a separate page,<br/>
put a noticeable link on the front page to that page and make that page<br/>
available to members only. But he chose not to. <br/>

You can get a happy meal for 47 cents? I've lost touch with fast food! <br/>
