For my first plant, Red Sox Nation, I had the stamp design long before the <br/>

                    <div id="ygrps-yiv-1060024002">It truly depends upon the purpose.  Sometimes the location drives the <br/>
stamp (like the soon to be planted Velvet Elvis), sometimes I'll have <br/>
a particular stamp that needs a location (like my recent ambigram <br/>
boxes) and it really does not matter.  But my favorites are where the <br/>
clue concept (as in eevil boxes) drives the stamp and sometimes the <br/>
location.<br/>
<br/>
Some people "choose" to only find stamps that match a particular <br/>
location, but by the same talking they exclude themselves from a lot <br/>
of creativity.<br/>
<br/>
So, you can take your pick as there is no hard fast rule.<br/>

Be wary of planting in sensitive ecological areas.  <br/>
