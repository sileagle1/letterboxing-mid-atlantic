Thanks for the welcome and greeting.  There are four of us in all, so <br/>
we could be Joe and 3 Bucks!(but that is really not fair to my wife!)<br/>
We are in Exton, PA (30 minutes south of King of Prussia) and we love <br/>
this outdoor activity with our two boys (ages 4 and 2).  Regarding <br/>
the board, I don't know if was on letterboxing.org or atlasquest, but <br/>
I saw it referenced and signed up.  Hope to eventually meet some you <br/>
at a gathering. Again, thanks for the warm welcome.<br/>
