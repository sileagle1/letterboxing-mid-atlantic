<p>You and PiPi (sp?) make a wonderful letterboxing couple to join the fun.  I was glad to exchange.</p>
<p>Meeting ArialBird (or Archeo?) - you know who you are - was a treat.  With his ear for bird calls and a friendly smile, another great addition to LBMA and exchange.</p>
<p>Then there were the tried and true RedHat Box'rs - Irene brought us hat gifts (now I have two jesters caps to pick from), MizScarlet approaching true RedHat status has already started losing things (this time the car keys),  Sheba couldn't stay over but packed home a new brew and an egg beer, while Gerania (osmosed into the group) still can't get served her meal efficiently.</p>
<p>We had a great stay at the <u><em>Youth</em></u> Hostel, like a going to sleep-over camp (not that I ever did, so am reliving my youth as it should have been).  If HnH can get it reserved for Tyler3 - be sure to sign up as soon as it is posted on AQ (Irene, try to get that done before November 1st!)</p>
<p>Also, a thank you to Choi for sending in a great event stamp.</p>
<p>Which reminds me I should post the clues for the one I planted . . . and appologize here for the crummy carving - may redo before Tyler3 - but at least the clues will be up.</p>
<p>So for those of you who haven't left for the Holiday Weekend  - have a spectacular and safe time and we will do it again in '07.</p>

last night was the first chance I had to log-in, but I also got a <br/>
bottle of nine year old scotch that held my attention more than the <br/>
computer.<br/>
<br/>
I sincerly want to thank everyone that attended the Get Boxed! mini <br/>
gather.  You made us feel very welcome.  <br/>
<br/>
Have a great holiday season everyone.<br/>

When I locate the gd USB cord for the camera, you'll have your photos.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks again,<br/>
