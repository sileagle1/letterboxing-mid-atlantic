Where are you boxing this weekend?<br/>
<br/>
I was thinking that I have two windows for boxing this weekend:  <br/>
Saturday (7/24) Morning at Green Lane with Thomas (have a couple to <br/>
find yet and some others to research including Chin Knees and the new <br/>
ones H+H provided at the Gathering).  I'm on kid patrol in the <br/>
afternoon, as Mrs. LB is doing a beading thing at Kalmbach Park in <br/>
Macungie (a future LB plant!).<br/>
<br/>
Sunday morning is Mass, but Sunday (7/25) Afternoon is full of <br/>
possibilities.  I'm thinking maybe a return to my old hiking grounds <br/>
of the Pinnacle and Pulpit Rock (complete with time saving <br/>
shortcuts).  This one, being more strenuous, would be sans Thomas.<br/>
<br/>
Down the road, someday, I'd like to tackle some mystery boxes as I <br/>
think that I figured out exactly where the boxes are - Silent <br/>
Doug's "Stone Face", the Mapsurfer's "Chester County Compass <br/>
Conundrum" and almost totally solving "Speaking in Ancient Tongues" <br/>
(sorry, I am German, not Basque, but the internet is helpful).  If <br/>
anybody wants to trade notes or involve me in a mystery solving <br/>
partnership, please let me know.<br/>
<br/>
Any takers?<br/>

<div>Hye, Lightnin' bug is looking for a "study" partner. He feels he's pretty close on some and is looking for someone to kibbitz with offlist. I am not that person. I barely found the "yellow rocks" in Pennypack the other night and was on the wrong trail for quite awhile. but hey, I actually FOUND both of the boxes I set out to find so go me! </div>
<div> </div>
<div>By the way, I have added another count to my List. S for Searches.<br/>So my count goes something like:</div>
<div> </div>
<div>P12, X75, F43, S127  !!! LOL!</div>

<div>I thought about doing some box hunting myself this weekend, but it looks waaaay too wet.  I found the "Bloom Where You're Planted" box on Tuesday, which was fun; I actually used to live just up the block from where that box is now.  I forgot to take a pen with me, though, so the log there only has my stamp!  I intend to go back and leave a note when I can!  ;-)</div>

<div>I had been toying with the idea of looking for the "LunaSolBrujas" box tomorrow, but that all depends on the weather.  All this rain is depressing...</div>

Brandywine Springs Park is interesting in that it used to be a commercial amusement park until about 1915 or so then closed down. The forest has re-claimed the area but there are still foundations and railroad tracks, etc all around. And along the trail there are pictures showing what the park used to look like in certain areas. Pretty interesting. Found the first box totally flooded so dried it out and did repairs. Never found the second box. I am pretty darn sure I was in the right spot at the right tree but the tree has so badly desintegrated into wood pulp it was impossible to search efficiently. I emailed the placers to find out what the deal is. Today is putter around the house day. Happy Hunting! </div>
