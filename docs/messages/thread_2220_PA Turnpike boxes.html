America's First Super Highway is listed on LB.org, but under PA Mystery.  I am saddened to <br/>
hear it has been muggled.  I worked so hard on ordering that stamp from the <br/>
manufacturer.  I guess it's time to check up on both of these boxes.  It wasn't a worthy <br/>
hiding place, anyway...<br/>

My apologies for the broken heart, but it's just something a guy like me has just had to <br/>

Thanks to Cyclonic, we found the clues on lb.org and deciphered no <br/>
problem for a recent trip on the PA TP.  The only difficulty was that <br/>
my father (Games grilling man of Two Cooks) and I are directionally <br/>
challenged and messed up west vs east bound, and so stopped at the <br/>
wrong place whilst westbound.  We found various unmentionables but <br/>
obviously no box, muggled or otherwise.  Of course, we didn't figure <br/>
it out until we had passed the westbound stop while travelling in the <br/>
correct direction.<br/>
<br/>
re: Who is Peter J. Camiel?<br/>
One of our favorite boxes of all time.<br/>
<br/>
re: Holy Turnpike<br/>
When I was a kid, we often travelled the TP on the way to visit <br/>
relatives in OH.  My imagination was always taken by this place, and <br/>
we pointed it out to the kids on our recent trip because it is so <br/>
unique.  Glad to see I know have a good reason to stop (as if I didn't <br/>
before! but somehow never did).<br/>

A little closer to home, but a nice place to make your first pit stop <br/>
and stretch your legs, the "NH Lady Slipper Finds a Home in PA" box, <br/>
in Carlisle, is one of my all-time favorite stamps.  Just gorgeous. We <br/>
also got the "PA Women's Series #1 -- Mary Macauley" stamp in <br/>
Carlisle, which is a great stamp by Crayola Posse.<br/>

dark, but the clues were pretty obvious once you figured out where you <br/>
were supposed to be, and to my knowledge the box wasn't there.  I <br/>
checked every tree, not just the fourth one.<br/>

The westbound box I found.  Open, in pieces, bags undone, no stamp or <br/>
logbook.  No signs of animal damage.  Covered in mud, thoroughly <br/>
muggled.  <br/>

Natty, I did attempt to tell you about this first, they were after all <br/>
your boxes.  I sent you a message on AQ sometime over Christmas <br/>
weekend, probably Saturday the 23rd.<br/>
<br/>
As far as Harmonist Cemetery goed, I think that's the first box'n I'm <br/>
gonna do when I come back into the states.  Prolly on Sunday the 28th, <br/>
get that one, the Hereford Manor series, and a few drive-bys in the <br/>
area.</div>
