On to Middle Earth.  Today while returning to a main trail after <br/>
stamping in to a box that was on our agenda, I saw some rocks that <br/>
were out of place in the woods and suspiciously placed.  I moved the <br/>
rocks out of curiosity and found a box without clues!  Now the <br/>
problem, I can't find the clues!  They are not on LBNA or AQ or listed <br/>
as a mystery box.  I googled Middle Earth Letterbox too, but no <br/>
results!  Does anyone know if this is a WOM box or if I'm missing <br/>
something?  I would like to see the clues now that I found the box.<br/>

As for you, ms. chaos, we will certainly include you in year-end <br/>
prayers and, if you are not well enough to make the journey, we <br/>
would be happy to go check on the boxes as soon as tomorrow, weather <br/>
permitting.  I can say that the one we found was in good shape but <br/>
we weren't aware of the others so we can't give an update.  If the <br/>
rain holds off until later in the day we'll head out and find those <br/>
and place another in the growing "spongebob" series.  Although, <br/>
after seeing some of the websites online with all of the text and <br/>
everything about each spongebob episode we are going to step up the <br/>
clue difficulty so as to ensure that only a true spongebob fan will <br/>
be able to decipher them:)<br/>

<br/>
The boxes are mine and were taken off the website when I received <br/>
reports that one was missing rather than disappoint (my Carlisle <br/>
Indian School Box went missing at around the same time.)<br/>
<br/>
I checked on them today- was feeling pretty good-- boxes 1, 3 and 4 <br/>
are still there, box 2 is missing--which is very disappointing as it <br/>
was probably the better of all the stamps there carved just about 5 <br/>
years ago when I was a new boxer.<br/>
<br/>
There is another box in the same place as 2 was--in fact under the <br/>
same stone--planted by a group of 30 preschool bible school kids <br/>
whose teacher I had tried to disuade from bringing a group that large <br/>
and that young to letterbox. (?????) The box they planted does not <br/>
have a stamp in it--only a log book-- and doesn't look as though it's <br/>
listed anywhere.<br/>
<br/>
I've cleaned out the geotrinkets left by the pre-school group and <br/>
emptied them of some water.  The remaining boxes appear to be in good <br/>
shape.  I don't know if I'll relist them or not, but the clues L'bug <br/>
found are good.  I did pull them a couple of years ago for a bit <br/>
after some vandalism in the area.<br/>
<br/>
Box 4 shares a spot with a geocache so if you've never geocached you <br/>
can take a look to see what they look like.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Hope that helps.<br/>
