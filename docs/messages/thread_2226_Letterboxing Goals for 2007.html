                    <div id="ygrps-yiv-218336212">So, I've been putting some thought into what I want to do in 2007, and <br/>
come up with a few goals:<br/>
<br/>
Many more plants.  I have about 40 or so now, I would like to get that <br/>
up to 150 by the end of the year.  I have so many ideas, it is time to <br/>
implement them.  Here are some of the boxes you can look forward to in <br/>
the new year:<br/>
- 7 Wonders of Bucks County<br/>
- More Bunny Hunt boxes (finally)<br/>
- More Bucks County Haunts boxes<br/>
- Alice in Wonderland series<br/>
- Zelda series<br/>
<br/>
Update my website.  I don't expect it to be a fantastic, interactive <br/>
site, but just get some thoughts, ideas, and information up there for <br/>
folks.  Inofrmation like exacto carving, what to look for when planting, <br/>
and how to build a micro box.  Things that I am stong at and can help <br/>
others with.<br/>
<br/>
More finds.  I really slacked off at the end of the year and have not <br/>
been out much.  I want to get into better shape, and one way to do that <br/>
is to get out there and find some boxes.  I have to time, now I just <br/>
have to use it.<br/>
<br/>
So, what is everyone else planning for the upcoming year?<br/>

attempts!) as soon I get back from the Philippines.<br/>

2.  Solve "Knock that Carp off and Quit being so Koi" ans "Stanley <br/>

fall into place.<br/>

2.  Find/plant boxes in states that we have yet to venture into:  <br/>
Iowa, Kansas, Wyoming, Arizona, Illinois (2 trips planned out west).<br/>
3.  Improve our clues.  There are some great clues out there.  We <br/>

&gt; So, I've been putting some thought into what I want to do in 2007, <br/>
and <br/>
&gt; come up with a few goals:<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Many more plants.  I have about 40 or so now, I would like to get <br/>
that <br/>
&gt; up to 150 by the end of the year.  I have so many ideas, it is <br/>
time to <br/>
&gt; implement them.  Here are some of the boxes you can look forward <br/>
to in <br/>
&gt; the new year:<br/>
&gt; - 7 Wonders of Bucks County<br/>
&gt; - More Bunny Hunt boxes (finally)<br/>
&gt; - More Bucks County Haunts boxes<br/>
&gt; - Alice in Wonderland series<br/>
&gt; - Zelda series<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Update my website.  I don't expect it to be a fantastic, <br/>
interactive <br/>
&gt; site, but just get some thoughts, ideas, and information up there <br/>
for <br/>
&gt; folks.  Inofrmation like exacto carving, what to look for when <br/>
planting, <br/>
&gt; and how to build a micro box.  Things that I am stong at and can <br/>
help <br/>
&gt; others with.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; More finds.  I really slacked off at the end of the year and have <br/>
not <br/>
&gt; been out much.  I want to get into better shape, and one way to do <br/>
that <br/>
&gt; is to get out there and find some boxes.  I have to time, now I <br/>
just <br/>
&gt; have to use it.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; So, what is everyone else planning for the upcoming year?<br/>

When you think about it, you can take the A-Team approach, just drug him <br/>
and stick him in a car ;-)<br/>

boxes is that when you finally do figure them out, when a key to the <br/>

<p>So, I've been putting some thought into what I want to do in 2007, and 
  <br/>come up with a few goals:<br/><br/>Many more plants. I have about 40 or so 
  now, I would like to get that <br/>up to 150 by the end of the year. I have so 
  many ideas, it is time to <br/>implement them. Here are some of the boxes you 
  can look forward to in <br/>the new year:<br/>- 7 Wonders of Bucks County<br/>- 
  More Bunny Hunt boxes (finally)<br/>- More Bucks County Haunts boxes<br/>- Alice 
  in Wonderland series<br/>- Zelda series<br/><br/>Update my website. I don't 
  expect it to be a fantastic, interactive <br/>site, but just get some thoughts, 
  ideas, and information up there for <br/>folks. Inofrmation like exacto 
  carving, what to look for when planting, <br/>and how to build a micro box. 
  Things that I am stong at and can help <br/>others with.<br/><br/>More finds. I 
  really slacked off at the end of the year and have not <br/>been out much. I 
  want to get into better shape, and one way to do that <br/>is to get out there 
  and find some boxes. I have to time, now I just <br/>have to use it.<br/><br/>So, 
  what is everyone else planning for the upcoming year?<br/>-- <br/>Nathan
