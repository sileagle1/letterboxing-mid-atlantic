<br/>
   Hello and happy holidays to everybody.  I guess<br/>
we're lurkers.  We discovered letterboxing in the<br/>
Games magazine article a few months back.  We were<br/>
geocachers (still are, but not so much anymore), and<br/>
this sounded even better to us.<br/>
<br/>
We live in the Pottstown, PA area, and have enjoyed<br/>
finding a lot of local boxes.  Which brings me to a<br/>
question...  I didn't realize it was kosher to ask for<br/>
WOM clues in this public forum, until somebody did<br/>
last week.  (We're still newbies!)  So...if there are<br/>
any WOM clues in southeastern PA, could you pass them<br/>
along to us?  Thanks so much!<br/>
<br/>
We hope you've enjoyed our two plants so far.  We have<br/>
another one in the works...hopefully in January.<br/>

myself to a gather, then to back out due to car trouble. Stupid <br/>
expensive furrin' car!<br/>
<br/>
We are: Stargazermomma, Yobo (he's the map guy, and also my Google-<br/>
master when I am out boxing and need help with a clue I thought I'd <br/>
deciphered; this happens quite a bit so I need to just stamp him into <br/>
the boxes I find),Gryphon and Rowan (the younguns) and 2 boxing dogs, <br/>
Cleo and Beaulah.<br/>
<br/>
We started boxing after hearing about it from a (now) legendary <br/>
letterboxer. (She will no doubt pop in here to deny any legendary <br/>
status,but I think she is!)Moved to a place with a dearth of boxes, <br/>
lost (almost) all our plants to Hurricane Katrina, and pretty much <br/>
quit boxing. Now that we are here in the Land O Plenty, its renewed <br/>
our (ok, MY) love for letterboxing, and hopefully I will plant many <br/>
more in the upcoming months. Got lots of ideas...<br/>
<br/>
Also a home schooling family, a military family, and looonnggg winded!<br/>

                    <div id="ygrps-yiv-416977612">Hi, I've posted at newboxers a couple of times but just lurked here. <br/>
H n H referred me to this list when I hunted her Big Green Monster. BTW,  has #2 been replanted yet. I must confess that I believe I know what happened to the first planting. I may have even been there when it was muggled by park staff. This would have been back when I was in Maintenance at the park and not a letterboxer. My coworker and I found it and I had him put it back after reading the letter. Funny how it didn't stick then. Anyway, later (as in a year or more) our Superintendent asked Maintenance to clean out by the old stone entrances of the tree nursery. This is when it was lost I believe, by then I was in the Visitor Center as a historian. Sorry H N H. Sorry for the babbling but here is the good news........<br/>
<br/>
I spoke to my Superintendent today and told him I plan on planting many boxes in the park and he was all for it. So my goals are to plant many boxes in Wash Xing State Park - NJ this year. As an addition to the NJ State History Fair at WCSP I plan on having a special event stamp/box for us as well as a low key one for all visitors to the fair. I also hope to attend a gather this year but with 3 young ones and a 4th on the way, it may difficult. Plus my wife may not like me taking 4 kids under 6 to Isaac Newton's :)<br/>
<br/>
I received carving supplies for Christmas and have carved two stamps so far, not very good but they will get better.<br/>
<br/>
Shorthand: My 1st plant and more at WCSP, more boxing, attend a gather, carve more, have my first special event stamp, decide on a personal trail name.<br/>

people to keep an eye on them. This year there were<br/>
quite a few running around. My son Mambo Dog did his<br/>
share of baby wrangling. If I was your wife I'd be<br/>
glad for an afternoon with only one kid. Hope to see<br/>
you on the trail.<br/>

 &gt; was kosher to ask for WOM clues in this public forum, until somebody<br/>
 &gt; did last week.  (We're still newbies!)  So...if there are any WOM<br/>
 &gt; clues in southeastern PA, could you pass them along to us?  Thanks so<br/>
 &gt; much!<br/>
 &gt;<br/>
<br/>
</span></blockquote>Generally, I don't see it as kosher.  WOM's are something that should be <br/>
given, a gift, and not something asked for, at least in my book.  In the <br/>
end, it is totally up to the planter though and how they want to <br/>
distribute their clues.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply">  &gt; We hope you've enjoyed our two plants so far.  We have another one in<br/>
 &gt; the works...hopefully in January.<br/>

</span></blockquote>While I have yet to find them, I have enjoyed the clues (figured them <br/>
out), they are excellent.  Keep it up.  Hope you are having fun with <br/>
some of the Mapsurfer boxes.<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply">  &gt; Hi, I've posted at newboxers a couple of times but just lurked here.<br/>
 &gt; H n H referred me to this list when I hunted her Big Green Monster.<br/>
 &gt; BTW,  has #2 been replanted yet. I must confess that I believe I know<br/>
 &gt; what happened to the first planting. I may have even been there when<br/>
 &gt; it was muggled by park staff. This would have been back when I was in<br/>
 &gt; Maintenance at the park and not a letterboxer. My coworker and I found<br/>
 &gt; it and I had him put it back after reading the letter. Funny how it<br/>
 &gt; didn't stick then. Anyway, later (as in a year or more) our<br/>
 &gt; Superintendent asked Maintenance to clean out by the old stone<br/>
 &gt; entrances of the tree nursery. This is when it was lost I believe, by<br/>
 &gt; then I was in the Visitor Center as a historian. Sorry H N H. Sorry<br/>
 &gt; for the babbling but here is the good news........<br/>
 &gt;<br/>
 &gt; I spoke to my Superintendent today and told him I plan on planting<br/>
 &gt; many boxes in the park and he was all for it. So my goals are to plant<br/>
 &gt; many boxes in Wash Xing State Park - NJ this year. As an addition to<br/>
 &gt; the NJ State History Fair at WCSP I plan on having a special event<br/>
 &gt; stamp/box for us as well as a low key one for all visitors to the<br/>
 &gt; fair. I also hope to attend a gather this year but with 3 young ones<br/>
 &gt; and a 4th on the way, it may difficult. Plus my wife may not like me<br/>
 &gt; taking 4 kids under 6 to Isaac Newton's :)<br/>
 &gt;<br/>
 &gt; I received carving supplies for Christmas and have carved two stamps<br/>
 &gt; so far, not very good but they will get better.<br/>
 &gt;<br/>
 &gt; Shorthand: My 1st plant and more at WCSP, more boxing, attend a<br/>
 &gt; gather, carve more, have my first special event stamp, decide on a<br/>
 &gt; personal trail name.<br/>
 &gt;<br/>
 &gt; Sincerely,<br/>
 &gt; Mark<br/>
 &gt; currently using the family trailname of PM JET<br/>
<br/>
</span></blockquote>I hope you keep your stamp handy, I may have to stop by for an exchange <br/>
there :-)<br/>
<br/>
I have a box up there to maintain and an basement box to adopt, maybe <br/>
this week would be a good time to do that.<br/>

We found out about letterboxing from some online friends in Texas earlier<br/>
this past summer (Wednesday will be our 6-month boxing anniversary).  We<br/>
were fortunate enough to have some boxes nearby that were planted by the<br/>
colorful posse from Happy Valley, jbzfarm and a few others.  We loved<br/>
everything about our first finds and were hooked.  We had the pleasure of<br/>
meeting a number of people at the Knoebels gathering.  Since then we have<br/>
really gotten into the planting/carving and are having a blast.  We just<br/>
went out and did some maintenance on one of our 1st plants and it was nearly<br/>
as exciting as finding a letterbox! Seeing what comments boxers put in the<br/>
log was a real thrill.<br/>

I'm a regular lurker, but I've been to a few gatherings and have met <br/>
some of you.  My team is DJ2A (family initials; I'm 'D', for Doris). <br/>
We've been slowing working towards 100 finds over the last few years, <br/>
starting with some boxes in MA and CT when we visited The End Gang <br/>
(aka Koyote and family), who are relatives of ours and now reside in <br/>
VA. I love this hobby, especially the hiking and the treasure <br/>
hunting/puzzle solving aspects. I'd like to spend more time hunting <br/>
boxes, but am always balancing against the work/school/sports/house <br/>
commitments, plus my other time-consuming hobbies. Life is good...<br/>
<br/>
Happy New Year!<br/>
D of DJ2A<br/>

<br/>
Originally, Cyclonic and I teamed up to form Team Evil for the 2005 <br/>
Rubbermade Road Rally.  We went out first, sowing eevil in the form <br/>
of distracting hitchhikers and fake bonus boxes.  We did not win, <br/>
because we were too busy sowing distraction, but were most efficient <br/>
in terms of miles driven at both rallies.<br/>
<br/>
The first mention of the term eevil was from our Queen of Typos (H+H, <br/>
who will no doubt owe me an @$$ whuppin' for this) in post 4910 of <br/>
this board right around that time.<br/>
<br/>
Eevil clues started appearing with varying amounts of eee's in <br/>
January 2005 (actually October 2005, if you count Kalimantan Hands - <br/>
the original scare 'em away box clue) with Math Test.<br/>
<br/>
A clue is considered eevil if it gets somebody to complain about it <br/>
publically (like the Queen of Typos or General Judy of the SewSoBuzzy <br/>
Army), or by having the creator being called a brat offline by Berks <br/>
county residents with little dawgs.  Especially eevil are boxes that <br/>
may hidden in their backyards.<br/>
<br/>
There is nothing inherently bad about eevil, it is more mischievous <br/>
in a fun way.<br/>
<br/>
Anybody can and should create eevil boxes, especially near Bensalem <br/>
or Exeter Township.<br/>

&gt; Joe, to put my 2 cents in...  Knowing you guys, definitely do the <br/>
Mt <br/>
&gt; Misery box - it's worth the hike b/c there are others up there too <br/>
&gt; (just research a little).  But unless Ethan is a history/learning <br/>
buff <br/>
&gt; already, wait another year.  Peter got so into the story, he <br/>
talked <br/>
&gt; about it for days afterwards, he made us tour Gen'l Wash's hq's &amp; <br/>
the <br/>
&gt; vf park office (which they've been to before, but were happy to go <br/>
&gt; through again w/ this experience).  And, both the boys hiked up <br/>
&gt; themselves (3.5 &amp; just turned 6), although Gabe got a ride back <br/>
down on <br/>
&gt; Rob's shoulders.  Liane/4 suits<br/>

&gt; &gt; Another Semi-Lurker here.  Relatively new to this and have <br/>
posted a <br/>
&gt; &gt; few times.  Mostly lurk because of newness and just trying to <br/>
take it <br/>
&gt; &gt; all in.  We are planning for our first plant in 2007 and are <br/>
hopeful <br/>
&gt; &gt; to join one of the "kid friendly" events this year.<br/>
