&gt; &gt; &gt; found <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; the tupperware cracked <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; and split and the SPOR had migrated quite far<br/>

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; same day by some new boxers, I'm guessing, and<br/>
&gt; &gt; log was not bagged <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; at <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; all. There was a bag <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; in the box but log was just out. The stamp was<br/>
&gt; &gt; bagged but not the <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; log, go figure.<br/>
