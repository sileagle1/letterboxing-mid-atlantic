<br/>
The idea actually came from a couple of geocachers, but plagiarism is <br/>
the finest form of flattery.<br/>
<br/>
A father and son team had a couple of "travel bugs" that they were <br/>
racing from Duluth, MN to Allentown, PA.  A travel bug is kind of a <br/>
hitchhiker for geocachers, with folks logging their progress from <br/>
cache to cache.  Well, I got wrapped up in this when I found one of <br/>
these travel bugs in a combo geocache/letterbox that my son and I <br/>
found.  I got the one bug to Allentown, PA first (that's where we <br/>
live) and the race was won!<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, is there any desire to try this sort of 'race' in the <br/>
letterboxing community?  Here's what I have in mind - a couple of <br/>
letterboxers create a couple of hitchhikers that want to come home - <br/>
to a specific geographic area.  These hitchhikers will be placed in <br/>
close proximity to start the race (like a couple of boxes in a <br/>
series) and the sent on their merry way.  The first one to arrive at <br/>
their destination wins.<br/>
<br/>

you would like it to be a cross country race. <br/>
<br/>
If you start them off in boxes in the same series, it is most likely <br/>
that one person would find both hitchhikers at the same time. <br/>
<br/>
I would suggest starting them off in the same town, but not the same <br/>
park or series. This way it would be more likely that different <br/>
people would pick up and transport the HH's.<br/>

<br/>
So far, I count in Fleur de Lis, Hikers and Hounds, Judy B (sew so <br/>
bizzy, maybe) and Team LB.  Amanda has volunteered to be out <br/>
planter!  The trick would be to get the HH's collected and to Amanda <br/>
during one of her visits.  This could be something we gradually work <br/>
towards.  Another idea would be to mail them all to a common person <br/>
and they mail it out to Seattle.  H+H has also proposed taking them <br/>
up to NH for a shorter race.<br/>
<br/>
Let's begin by answering Judy's very pertinent questions.  These are <br/>
just some off the cuff ideas, so please interject if you think they <br/>
are flawed.<br/>
<br/>
1)  The log book in each HH would say what the race is about, so that <br/>
people will know to git it along!<br/>
<br/>
2)  I am thinking point Z ought to be a city or at least close to <br/>
it.  Amanda made a great suggestion about originally planting in the <br/>
same starting city.  May I suggest that these be LB's with high <br/>
vistation rates so that things move along quickly.<br/>
<br/>
3)  As many different LB'ers as we can cram in ought to participate.  <br/>
The more the merrier.  <br/>
<br/>
4)  Prize?  The one the geocachers did were for family pride (it was <br/>
father against son!).  I guess we can cobble together a prize, like a <br/>
certificate that decalres that the winner is no longer a 'reviled <br/>
newbie' (  ;-) sorry, we are not on the main list) or some such <br/>
silliness.  We can certainly brainstorm that one!<br/>
<br/>
Maybe we ought to try a theme for the HH's - like fast or slow <br/>
things.  Fast can be rockets, falcons and such.  Slow can be slugs, <br/>
amoebas, a dial-up connection.<br/>
<br/>
I think that I have opened an interesting can of worms on this one, <br/>
but hey is seems liek a fun can of worms!!!!<br/>
<br/>
I am certain we'll be doing lots of scheming,<br/>

&gt; <br/>
&gt; Maybe we ought to try a theme for the HH's - like fast or slow <br/>

&gt;Date: Sat, 24 Jul 2004 23:46:16 -0000<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Here's something for you HH fans to ponder...<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;The idea actually came from a couple of geocachers, but plagiarism is<br/>
&gt;the finest form of flattery.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;A father and son team had a couple of "travel bugs" that they were<br/>
&gt;racing from Duluth, MN to Allentown, PA.  A travel bug is kind of a<br/>
&gt;hitchhiker for geocachers, with folks logging their progress from<br/>
&gt;cache to cache.  Well, I got wrapped up in this when I found one of<br/>
&gt;these travel bugs in a combo geocache/letterbox that my son and I<br/>
&gt;found.  I got the one bug to Allentown, PA first (that's where we<br/>
&gt;live) and the race was won!<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Anyway, is there any desire to try this sort of 'race' in the<br/>
&gt;letterboxing community?  Here's what I have in mind - a couple of<br/>
&gt;letterboxers create a couple of hitchhikers that want to come home -<br/>
&gt;to a specific geographic area.  These hitchhikers will be placed in<br/>
&gt;close proximity to start the race (like a couple of boxes in a<br/>
&gt;series) and the sent on their merry way.  The first one to arrive at<br/>
&gt;their destination wins.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;If anybody is interested in exploring this possibility, please let me<br/>
&gt;know.<br/>

This sounds like great fun! We'll participate! If you are coming up <br/>
with the guidelines, just let us know what to do! I'm assuming each <br/>
participant will simply create a HH according to the guidelines and <br/>
they will all go to one person to plant as discussed?<br/>

Sounds like we are building some critical mass here!  I'd like to <br/>
propose that the HH'er get to the great Keystone state or the state <br/>
of the original carver.  Your choice, as we have folks from PA, NJ <br/>
and VA signed up this far.  I'll email the list out once I get it <br/>

<div>Carmen and I were talking and someone mentioned on a post, I think it was Poison Ivy, a "hitchiker hostel". What if you, LB, planted something like that near you for the HH's to land in. The "finish line" and you could retieve them once they did and mail them back to us? Just an idea, but we'll do whatever the group wants. "Go Speed Racer, go Speed Racer, go Speed Racer GO!"</div>
