You know, I have solved both of those mysteries, but I couldn't figure <br/>
out the EEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE thing.  You folks truly are wackos.  I'm <br/>
glad to have met you.<br/>
<br/>
By the way, the website is up.  I still need to add my photo and the <br/>
photo's section, but pother than that it is fully functional.  Take a <br/>
loof and tell me what you think.<br/>
