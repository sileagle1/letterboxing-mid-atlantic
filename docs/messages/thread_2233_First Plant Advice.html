                    <div id="ygrps-yiv-689007">I only have planted one, but I've watched a lot of posts like this, so <br/>
I can try to summarize them for you:<br/>
<br/>
Plant really close to the trail, or very far away from the trail, or <br/>
somewhere in between.<br/>
Camouflage your box with tape or paint or a bag of some sort or just <br/>
rocks and sticks.<br/>
Make the clues and then plant, plant and then make the clues.<br/>
Post clues on AQ, LBMA, both, one of the other, or on your own website, <br/>
after all, it's special, it's your first box.<br/>
<br/>
Really, the best advice I was ever given in this hobby was after a few <br/>
beers with H&amp;H, she said:<br/>
<br/>
"Just do what you want, figure it out.  Don't give a sh*t about <br/>
whatever anyone else does."<br/>
<br/>
As long as you're respectful to nature, You'll probably be fine.<br/>

</span></blockquote>Let me impart my lack of wisdom into this disscussion :-)<br/>
<br/>
First off, don't sweat the details.  I wouldn't worry too much about <br/>
things like story clues, puzzles, and so on.  Just plant the box and <br/>
make it so folks can find it.  The rest will come with time.<br/>
<br/>
Don't worry about the stamp.  If it is hand carved, don't worry that it <br/>
is not a work of art, no one expects it to be.  Heck, if the location is <br/>
good, a store bought is just fine.  Sheba and I found a box with just a <br/>
store bought the other day, but the location was great, and the hike was <br/>
nice as well.<br/>
<br/>
Speaking of location, this is where you should really concentrate your <br/>
efforts.  When choosing a location, take a look around.  Is it close to <br/>
the trail?  Does it look like it floods?  Is there trash around?<br/>
<br/>
You don't really want to be close to the trail, it is easier for Muggles <br/>
to spot that way.  Look for plant that seem to all point in a single <br/>
direction, or soft muddy ground, these are clues to flooding.  If there <br/>
is trash around, it may be a hang out for kids, and not a good place for <br/>
a box.<br/>
<br/>
When planting, try to keep it a bit off the ground, it will stay drier <br/>
that way.  Also, if it is on the ground, us rocks as cover, as they will <br/>
protect the box better.  Rocks in a tree look suspicious, think natural <br/>
when planting the box.<br/>
<br/>
Smaller is better, it is easier to hide.  Bag well, double bagging the <br/>
log, but don't bag the outside, as these tend to get holes and pools of <br/>
water.  You can put ink in it if you wish, but remember the Mid Atlantic <br/>
has about 30 freeze/thaw cycles in the winter, and that can devastate an <br/>
ink pad.  Remeber seasons change, and so does plantlife.  A box that is <br/>
easy to get to in the winter may be impossible in the summer, and a box <br/>
well hidden in the summer may be right in the open in the winter.<br/>
<br/>
Have fun with it, just beware your surroundings.<br/>

Avoid being in sight of "the nosey kid". <br/>

All the rocks, sticks, leaves, and camoflage you can think of will <br/>
not protect a box whose hidey hole faces a close trail or other <br/>
place where kids, or other muggles, are likely to play on or pass <br/>
by. Think like a nosey kid. I have seen too many holes in trees that <br/>

&gt;   1. Avoid "sensitive" areas (e.g., historic buildings, rock <br/>
walls, delicate plants) and be respectful of the natural and human <br/>
environments.<br/>
&gt;   2. Don't plant too close to water.<br/>
&gt;   3. Rocks are empirically proven to be good cover, especially if <br/>
you ignore # 2.<br/>
&gt;   4. Plant somewhere that is beautiful and/or interesting.  It <br/>
should be a place people will be happy to have visited even if they <br/>
don't find the box.<br/>
&gt;   5. Don't plant in places that expose potential finders to <br/>
personal danger and/or criminal/civil liability.<br/>
&gt;   6. Camouflage is nice, but it's unclear that it actually makes a <br/>
difference.<br/>
&gt;   7. Make sure you mark on the box and/or log such warnings <br/>
as "Not a Geocache," "Nothing leaves this box," and "Take the stamp <br/>
and my cousin Jimmy will be paying you a visit."<br/>
&gt;   8. As a bit of defensive driving, check the geocaching site for <br/>
existing geocaches in the place where you are thinking of planting.  <br/>
Best to know in advance if people will be stumbling across your <br/>
letterbox as they use their spidey sense to narrow in on a <br/>
geocache.  Geocachers often remove "prizes" placed by others and <br/>
have been known to remove stamps by mistake.<br/>
&gt;   9. Integration of site/clues/stamp is always appreciated - at <br/>
least by me.  SSB is a master of this.<br/>
&gt;   10. Use a decent box.  No Gladware.  Douggerware, Lock N Lock, <br/>
and Posseware (those little army surplus decon containers) are the <br/>
preferred choices of many.<br/>
&gt;   11. Read Silent Doug's tips at his web site.<br/>
&gt;   12. Have fun.  Actually, that should be #2.<br/>

keeping tabs on this group (and to a lesser extent the Newbies group - and even lesser <br/>
extent the national group) can help you be more sensitive to your audience while planning <br/>
your clue.<br/>
<br/>
When I first started, I wasn't all that sensitive to the Finders wants and needs.  I'm still not.  <br/>
I'm NattyBumppo.  <br/>
<br/>
But I have an appreciation for the fact that a tough clue leading to a store bought stamp is <br/>
a big let-down for many.  Also there are all types of 'boxers out there with differing <br/>
physical abilities.  An enticing clue may be greatly disappointing when it is found to be <br/>
impassible to someone of more limited physical abilities.   I'm not saying you should limit <br/>
your placements, just be kind and give people a heads-up.<br/>
Anyway, these things (and others) I have learned on this group.  And while I do not always <br/>
follow them, I appreciate the game and the diversity of it's players more.<br/>
<br/>
In conclusion, you can often learn a lot about good and bad boxes by reading a couple of <br/>
rants.  But most importantly... just go do it!  The real learning is in the doing.  Hopefully <br/>
you will come back from the experience and teach us all something.<br/>

My few "box-less" plants are Ziploc double zipper pint-size freezer bags, covered entirely in either black or silver duct tape, depending what I am trying to match camoflage-wise.  These are great for sliding into little niches or laying under permanent structures..as they are virtually invisible. in these cases, I have used thinner, non-spiral logs and usually unmounted stamps.<br/><br/>If I found the bag in which you described, I would probably think it was garbage and toss it. I hope you gave them some friendly feedback.<br/><br/>How are things going down there..btw?<br/><br/>LW PhD<br/>"Nice Counts"<br/><br/><br/><p> __________________________________________________<br/>Do You Yahoo!?<br/>Tired of spam?
