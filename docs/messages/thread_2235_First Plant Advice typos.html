&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I believe I have set a new typo record for<br/>
&gt; myself, and in the <br/>
&gt; &gt; first week of the new year to boot, with no<br/>
&gt; alcohol involved! Woo-hoo!<br/>

&gt; still have to <br/>
&gt; &gt; work on hiding my boxes better. I have lost about<br/>
&gt; 5 or so and I must <br/>
&gt; &gt; admit most of them going missing was due to poor<br/>
&gt; hiding on my part. I <br/>
&gt; &gt; am very easily obred looking for a good hiding<br/>
&gt; spot. I actually don't <br/>
&gt; &gt; like planting at all. Love ot come up with ideas,<br/>
&gt; now love to carve, <br/>
&gt; &gt; but actually tromping about looking for a spot,<br/>
&gt; then wirting, then <br/>
&gt; &gt; POSTING the clues are my least favorite things. SO<br/>
&gt; I sorta give up <br/>
&gt; &gt; and put the box wherever. I guess my advise is<br/>
&gt; have a good attitute <br/>
&gt; &gt; and lot's of patience. Some folks like really<br/>
&gt; clever, well written <br/>
&gt; &gt; clues. I don't have a preference either way and<br/>
&gt; all of mine are very <br/>
&gt; &gt; simple. So you might want to think about the kind<br/>
&gt; of clue you want to <br/>
&gt; &gt; write before or during planting. Good luck!<br/>
