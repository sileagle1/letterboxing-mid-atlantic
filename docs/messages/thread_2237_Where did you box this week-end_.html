Wonderful hike, good company and great boxes. <br/>

just before it was pulled after the holidays. A fine warm day, but oh <br/>
that mud everywhere. We saw a group of geocachers. Then we spotted a <br/>
family with a big notebook searching around some logs. I kept wanting <br/>
to meet up with them but we were on different tracks. Then they passed <br/>
us while we were stamping in. Finally we met up at Mr. Toadys. It's <br/>
always great to run into boxers on the trail and do a trail exchange. <br/>
Nice folks. Busy day in the park. <br/>
<br/>
The Rudolph series was in a great park, a nice tour, fun, story clues, <br/>
and really cute, well carved stamps. Catch it next year if you can. <br/>

appropriate for a Monday...)  After being slightly puzzled by the<br/>
hound's trail, we managed to recover the Velvet Elvis in Berks County.<br/>
 Having a picnic table for stamping in and a sand pit to occupy the<br/>
kids was a plus.<br/>
<br/>
I can just imagine the conversation going on between the pages of our<br/>
log book between Elvis and Jerry Garcia...<br/>
