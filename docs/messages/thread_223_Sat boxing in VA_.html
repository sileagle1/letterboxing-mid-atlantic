The gang and I took two grandmother Woodwooses to Mt. Vernon, <br/>
George's little ole parcel down in VA way today. We visited the Mt. <br/>
Vernon Trail box planted in Ft. Hunt Park. Cool box with log going <br/>
back to early '02. The oldest box we have seen so far, and planted by <br/>
Hike it or Bike it folks. The third of theirs we have found, so <br/>
thanks to them for good boxes. The Log was somewhat full, there is <br/>
room on the back of the pages, and I forgot that I had a back up log <br/>
with me, so we stamped on the backs. Next visitor needs to take a <br/>
replacement as I think I understand that the "Hike/Bike" folks are <br/>
from north of here and do guerilla placing, i.e. place and don't get <br/>
back to check on them much or at all. Nice spot for a box. <br/>
We also did a placement. I noted that as the Mt. Vernon Estate is not <br/>
managed by the NPS then I decided to stash one there ON THE GROUNDS! <br/>
DA DA DA DUMMMMMMMMMM! Not sure why nobody has gone for this before <br/>
but "George's Little Box" is in place with clues soon to follow. Now <br/>
the grounds get upwards of a million visitors a year and are <br/>
amazingly well maintained so finding a good spot was tricky but we <br/>
did it. G for George is the word. Hope ya'll take the oppurtunity to <br/>
say howdy to our mini-box, and the many others in the area. We did <br/>
not get a chance to visit Huntley Meadows Park, but it appears that <br/>
there are a bunch there. Look forward to hunting some more there <br/>
sometime in the future.<br/>
Much Peaceful Trails to all,<br/>
