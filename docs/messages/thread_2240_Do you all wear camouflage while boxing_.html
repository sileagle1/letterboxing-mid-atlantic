Clay Creek yesterday.  Today, Mother Duck was out finding my <br/>
Cliffhanger series while I was in the same park.  What was really <br/>
strange was that I was logging in at this one box and I saw a man with <br/>
white hair approacing me from about 40 yards.  I put my head down to <br/>
fisnish signing in and when I looked up again, he had turned around <br/>
