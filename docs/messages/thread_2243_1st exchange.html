<br/>
I had my first exchange on Friday when Cyclonic stopped by the Visitor Center Museum. It was great to put a face to a name. <br/>
<br/>
It was pretty funny because I greeted him like any other visitor and when about my business. When I saw him I thought he looked like an avid hiker but we get a lot of those. <br/>
<br/>
Later he hung around the guestbook and then left. My colleague happened to glance at the guestbook a couple of minutes later and says... " Mark, I think this might be for you." I check it out and Nathan had left his stamp. I run outside and he is gone. I'm kicking myself for not realizing who he was.<br/>
<br/>
He came back later and I  am 99% sure it was him. He asked if I was Mark and we talked quite awhile.<br/>
<br/>
We had quite a nice chat and exchanged his great sig stamp for my just carved very rudimentary family stamp. <br/>
<br/>
Anyway, it was very exciting. Sheba, sorry I missed you on Tuesday Hopefully I'll catch you another time.<br/>
