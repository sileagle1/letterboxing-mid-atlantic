                    <div id="ygrps-yiv-129655991">..Ok....so I accepted an interview for our local paper here in <br/>
Northern Virginia.."The Loudoun Times Mirror"..The interview will be <br/>
out on Wednesday Jan. 17, 2006.  Before I get some backlash on the <br/>
interview, I'd like to let you know why I did it.  The interview was <br/>
offered to a lot of folks via a random email to members from <br/>
letterboxing.org.  I'd like to think I am a respectable letterboxer, <br/>
that promote the hobby, and nature etc.  I was afraid that If I didnt <br/>
take the offer, someone else might.  I also, hope the interviw I <br/>
provided them, will give some insight to the hobby, that we all want <br/>
to focus on, and I'd like to see some new faces here in the area.<br/>
<br/>
With that said, I should be able to proof-read the article before <br/>
release to make sure it protects us and this hobby from others.  I <br/>
also, should have a clue to a box that is only available to those that <br/>
buy this newspaper.  So if you want a one time only clue, be sure to <br/>
have it on hand.....the clue might be straight foward, or knowing <br/>
me..it will be in some kind of code in the interview.  If it is <br/>
straight foward, Im guessing locals will go find this box of the <br/>
published clues...If it is done this way, I will make the box, with <br/>
info on the hobby in the box, and further instructions as to what it <br/>
means to us, and guidelines etc.<br/>
<br/>
Just want to keep things as they are, but welcome in a few newbies <br/>
over time.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks, and let me know what ya think!<br/>

  you know why I did it. The interview <br/>was <br/>&gt; offered to a lot of 
  folks via a random email to members from <br/>&gt; letterboxing. org. I'd 
  like to think I am a respectable <br/>letterboxer, <br/>&gt; that promote the 
  hobby, and nature etc. I was afraid that If I <br/>didnt <br/>&gt; take the 
  offer, someone else might. I also, hope the interviw I <br/>&gt; provided them, 
  will give some insight to the hobby, that we all <br/>want <br/>&gt; to focus 
  on, and I'd like to see some new faces here in the area.<br/>&gt; <br/>&gt; With 
  that said, I should be able to proof-read the article before <br/>&gt; release 
  to make sure it protects us and this hobby from others. I <br/>&gt; also, 
  should have a clue to a box that is only available to those <br/>that <br/>&gt; 
  buy this newspaper. So if you want a one time only clue, be sure <br/>to 
  <br/>&gt; have it on hand.....the clue might be straight foward, or knowing 
  <br/>&gt; me..it will be in some kind of code in the interview. If it is 
  <br/>&gt; straight foward, Im guessing locals will go find this box of the 
  <br/>&gt; published clues...If it is done this way, I will make the box, 
  <br/>with <br/>&gt; info on the hobby in the box, and further instructions as to 
  what <br/>it <br/>&gt; means to us, and guidelines etc.<br/>&gt; <br/>&gt; Just 
  want to keep things as they are, but welcome in a few newbies <br/>&gt; over 
  time.<br/>&gt; <br/>&gt; Thanks, and let me know what ya think!<br/>&gt; <br/>&gt; 
  BD....there will be pic of my 2 kids letterboxing in the 
  paper!<br/>&gt;<br/><br/></p></div>
