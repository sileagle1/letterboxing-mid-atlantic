Akron!  Unfortunately it was raining most of the weekend out there - <br/>
enough to stop our foursome from doing any actual hikes (we even had a <br/>
hotel lined up near Zelienoble (sp?) for what looked like a good <br/>
stop).  The Pittsburg Children's Museum is FANTASTIC, though.  And we <br/>
saw some really beautiful scenery - amazing (scary) seeing the rivers <br/>
so high!  <br/>
<br/>
We were lucky to find the first two turnpike boxes, though, so not a <br/>
total bust.  <br/>
<br/>
Thanks again!  4 suits</div>
