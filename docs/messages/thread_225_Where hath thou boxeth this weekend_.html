Greetings fellow LMBA'ers.  Did the rain stay away or torment you in <br/>
typical fashion.  Did the lure of boing adventures overcome the fear <br/>
of eastern US sunshine?  I certainly hope so!!<br/>
<br/>
Team Lightnin' Bug did get out and box a bit.  We found a couple in <br/>
Green Lane park in the Upper Perky Valley of SE PA on Saturday.  Dad <br/>
went solo to plant a couple of new boxes in Emmaus, PA at the Pool <br/>
Wildlife Sanctuary today.  I had carved and mounted the stamps back <br/>
in May, but finally got out and planted them!  :-*<br/>
<br/>
Still have a couple more to plant, but they'll get done eventually.<br/>

didn't get out too much. Yesterday I checked on The Watcher and <br/>
confirmed that it's still there (some people have figured it out and <br/>
I wanted to make sure they weren't disappointed upon their visit with <br/>
a nowhere-to-be-found box). <br/>
<br/>
Worked a lot on some mystery boxes... :) <br/>
<br/>
I may break out the carving tools in a few, even though it's late, <br/>
just to do something...I'm dying of boredom at my end!<br/>

<div>I hunted down the LunaSolBrujas box in Silver Spring, MD, today.  Got a little lost (my bad, I didn't follow the directions carefully enough, I gotta get a pedometer), and got very wet (it was HUMID), but I found the box and left my mark.  Then I dashed home just as it started to rain!</div>

                    <div id="ygrps-yiv-807829005">Today, Jennifer and I replaced Marty's Jacobsburg boxes (which were planted <br/>
in 1999 and we've adopted). This is a two-box series where both stamps make <br/>
a single image, and the second box has been missing for quite some time <br/>
(making the series kind of pointless!). As a result, I re-carved both <br/>
stamps and rehid #2 in a new hiding place. The new clues are available here:<br/>

<br/>
Note: if you ever found #1 but not #2, you'll need to find #1 again in <br/>
order to make the image -- the new stamps are not the same size as the <br/>
originals!<br/>
