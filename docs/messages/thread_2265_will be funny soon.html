                    <div id="ygrps-yiv-268293938">Syner and I found Silent Doug's Panther Swamp box on Saturday, amid <br/>
snow squalls and blasting 30 MPH winds that drove the wind chill to -<br/>
5 degrees.  We had no trouble finding the box and it was a nice walk, <br/>
though removing our gloves to stamp in was an act of dedication to <br/>
the hobby.<br/>
<br/>
While looking through the log, we saw that Lightnin Bug had found it <br/>
on 12/30.  Below his stamp was written, "56.8 miles at 215 degrees <br/>
from this spot."<br/>
<br/>
The trails in this part of Promised Land have little numbered sign <br/>
posts - I figured that they referenced tree stands though we did not <br/>
see any.  However, the Panther Swamp box is in the section of trail <br/>
between 56 and 57, so what if the signs are mile markers?  Then the <br/>
box is about at 56.6 miles, and a bearing of 215 degrees from the box <br/>
points to a left turn in the trail.<br/>
<br/>
"Hey, Lightnin Bug left a new box out here," we thought with <br/>
excitement.  We looked for awhile on Saturday but with light fading <br/>
and a birthday party waiting, we bailed out before finding anything.<br/>
<br/>
We returned on Sunday morning, estimating distance based on time and <br/>
probable walking speed.  Once in the general vicinity, we searched <br/>
every stump, hollow, exposed root, and pile of rocks for nearly a <br/>
mile along the approximate bearing of 215 degrees heading away from <br/>
Silent Doug's box.  "It would have to be something obvious to a <br/>
letterboxer," we decided.<br/>
<br/>
We can now say that such an effort amid the brush at Promised Land <br/>
takes about 2 hours.  After all of that, still no box.  We left <br/>
disappointed but determined to narrow the search and find the box on <br/>
our next trip.<br/>
<br/>
Don't follow us.  We're lost.<br/>
<br/>
After an email exchange with Lightnin Bug, I can now tell you exactly <br/>
what is at 56.8 miles on a bearing of 215 degrees from this box:<br/>
<br/>
Lightnin Bug's house<br/>
<br/>
Yeah, he had a new GPS and was playing with it.<br/>

Syner and I are sure that this is funny, just isn't yet for us.  :)<br/>

unusual way of signing where I was from would mislead some folks.  <br/>
Ironically, none of the other boxes that I signed in that day with <br/>
GPS directions and distances to my backyard (actually, GPS signals do <br/>
not penetrate the roof) happened to have trail mile marker type <br/>
things nearby.  This includes a broad sweep from Scranton, PA to Port <br/>
Jervis, NY.  All distances and coordinates were chuckled at and <br/>
approved by the good Rev. Vulture.<br/>
<br/>
Sorry about the confuzzlement!  Yet another unintended consequence of <br/>
our mischief that trip.<br/>
