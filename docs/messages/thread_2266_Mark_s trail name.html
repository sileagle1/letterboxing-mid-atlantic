&gt; <br/>
&gt;  I went to Allegheny Art today (1/22) and asked for the pink stuff. I found it alongside the mastercarver and was checking it out. I was trying to decide what to buy because I'm still new to carving and wanted to try out different mediums. Problem was there were only 3 pieces of the pink stuff left. Thanks H&amp;H  and Cyclonic:)What if I really liked it, should I buy all 3? I was debating with myself and then turned to the lady and asked how often they ordered?<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; She said every 2 -3 weeks but this was a new product they had just ordered by request, so there should be several. I replied I knew. Then she saw there were only 3 and was like wow. Well the people who asked for it, I don't know if you are a member or not, I can't remember what they're called but they leave their art in the woods. <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I said yes I am a member and we call it letterboxing. At least she called it art, which in my case is very questionable. Anyway, I took 1 of each medium to try because if we keep buying they will keep stocking:)<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I was just curious if I should have let her know that she had been visited by the eeeevil family:)<br/>
