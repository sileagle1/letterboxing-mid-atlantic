I will probably call it "Fish in Outer Space Ride Again" or some such <br/>

days a week every week in that time and raising my F count. Just <br/>
found my 1st hitchhiker today also - although because of some water <br/>
damage to the enclosed paperwork I'm not positive who released it but <br/>
I am working on that. I went searching for PCLG's Coward Box and <br/>
finding it missing (after scouring the spot)I sent them an e-mail  I <br/>
heard back from Brian of PCLG who had advised they had all moved <br/>
away.  Rick (Rick_in_Boca) then advised me that Kris of the (B's) had <br/>
the box and was re-habing it.  I advised Brian who stated he was <br/>
thinking of letting people adopt the boxes and keep them going. <br/>
Sounds good. I would be interested in replacing the <br/>
missing "Positiviely New Jersey" box with a slight change in spot to <br/>
keep it from being kidnapped again. I'm up for others as well (at <br/>
least some of the one's I've solved the clues for) but I think it <br/>
would be fine to have a group effort.  Although I have been e-mailing <br/>

Most of the PCLG clues are easily cut and paste as text (with the <br/>

Yes, you must come on out to my gathering at Washington's Crossing (hey, <br/>
and the rest of you folks need to sign up, I know you want to be <br/>
there!).  We would be more then happy to have you.<br/>
<br/>
For the rest of you, I have enlisted my room mate to make burgers.  His <br/>
burgers are, well, awesome, not to be missed.  Irene can attest to that. <br/>
<br/>
The campsite has been secured, I have the permit for it in hand, so <br/>
please let me know if you would like to camp.<br/>
<br/>
Plans are coming together for night time boxing, which is OK with the <br/>
park (thanks Mark).  I think I will use a trail the wraps around the <br/>
campground, have to check it out first.  It will have plenty of boxes, <br/>
some stamps some of you may have, and some new ones as well.<br/>
<br/>
By mid April I should have a VERY large series of boxes planted.  I was <br/>
going to plant it in a nearby park, but I have decided to move the <br/>
location to Washington's Crossing and the adjoining county land, lots of <br/>
space there.  It will be permanent, look for it soon.<br/>

but I hope to have it out soon.  The grass is growing a little taller <br/>
and a little greener every day, so sheep vacation is fast approaching, <br/>
though we still have 4 more ewes ready to lamb and a batch of new <br/>
chicks to keep warm.  Not quite there yet...<br/>
<br/>
We did get out today though -- the first day of spring break, we <br/>
couldn't miss it!  <br/>
<br/>
We nabbed Long Beach Island Shark and Starfish with no problem, though <br/>
both logbooks are full and the shark box is in dire need of first aid -<br/>
- absolutely soaking wet, and the inkpad (which was in the same bag as <br/>
the logbook) ran, dyeing the log book blue.  Unfortunately our first <br/>
aid supplies were missing from our pack and we weren't able to do much.<br/>
<br/>
We looked unsuccessfully for Sand Crab, a box in the basement.  It is <br/>
buried beneath mounds and mounds of sand, if it is there at all.<br/>
<br/>
We also found Mosquito Madness, a great set of clues by the Cahillys <br/>
of Dumont.  Unfortunately, it was just leaning up against a tree trunk <br/>
in plain sight.  Could not tell who the previous finder was as they <br/>
had not signed their stamp, but we made sure it was better hidden <br/>
before leaving it (we just made it out of the park before darkness <br/>
fell).<br/>
<br/>
Hurray for spring!<br/>
