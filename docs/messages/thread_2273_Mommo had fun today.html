<br/>
To keep my boxing buddy, Trogdor, duly entertained during a day of <br/>
letterboxing I have learned to throw in some geocaching along the <br/>
way.  He likes his techie gadget and NOT having to do the artsy <br/>
fartsy part of letterboxing, i.e., stamping in.  BUT he's willing if <br/>
it's spread out a bit.<br/>
<br/>
We homeschool, so we took advantage of a reasonable weather day here <br/>
in Maryland to have a full day of P.E.<br/>
<br/>
We were having a great adventure with several box and cache <br/>
successes until we came to a certain geocache spot.  Sparing you <br/>
letterboxers the geo-details, we basically spent twenty minutes <br/>
poking into every nook and cranny around two huge fireplaces in a <br/>
picnic shelter.  As it turns out, I ended up having to get this <br/>
little micro-cache.  It entailed climbing up onto a picnic table, <br/>
then hauling my middle-aged self up onto a ledge above the <br/>
fireplace, then balancing up there and stepping even further up onto <br/>
a little wooden shelf, then reaching all the way up to my full five-<br/>
foot-two and pawing around sight unseen in the eaves hoping not to <br/>
run into creepy nasties, and lo and behold, there it was.  And of <br/>
course my son captured this maneuver on film.<br/>
<br/>
As we were leaving the site, thankfully back down on terra firm, I <br/>
told my son, "I hope you look back someday and think, 'I had a FUN <br/>
MOM!!!'"</div>
