last Fall -- Muskrat Ramble 2007 being the new one. I suspected MR II might have <br/>
been dragged off by animals, and on the way to plant the new one I stopped to search <br/>
one last time for MR II. To my great surprise, there it was! Sitting under its tree and <br/>
now highly visible in the green bag I had put it in last summer! I don't know where it's <br/>
been, but it's back. It's now wrapped in fall colors (I have no winter ones) and hidden <br/>
under leaves and bark. I went on to plant MR 2007 a little farther along the trail. So <br/>
you all can get 2 for 1 with a short hike!<br/>
