                    <div id="ygrps-yiv-421709021">I am still recuperating from our experience on the mountain<br/>
yesterday - Haycock Mountain that is.  Sheba and I decided to make the<br/>
trek for the Ice Age series.  Maybe we should have figured that<br/>
something was bound to happen when we ignored the snow flurries and<br/>
light drizzle on the way up to the mountain.  And maybe another hint<br/>
might have been the slippery rocks as we began our walk to box number<br/>
one.  But, we are women!  We are tough!  So we moseyed along the<br/>
trail, quickly picking up boxes one through four.  (Oh, box number<br/>
three proved to be my 800th find!)<br/>
<br/>
Somehow we seemed to totally miss box number five.  Maybe it was<br/>
because we began to focus more on the ice which was coating the rocks<br/>
as we hit the higher elevation.  When we hit a particularly narrow<br/>
rock which had a thick layer of ice and a nice drop down its side, we<br/>
decided that no box was worth this.  So we turned around and started<br/>
to head down only to discover another trail heading up the west side<br/>
of the mountain.  It proved to be a much easier walk and we quickly<br/>
ended up at box number 7 and also were able to get box number 6.  We<br/>
then decided to take the same easier trail back down the mountain. <br/>
But being good little letterboxers, the call of box number 5 was just<br/>
too strong.  So we thought that if we just headed east from the easy<br/>
trail, we would eventually reach the original trail and could search<br/>
for number 5. <br/>
<br/>
What we didn't realize was that this mountain is one big boulder<br/>
field.  We kept climbing over one boulder after another, always<br/>
expecting to see the trail after the next one.  At one point we ran<br/>
into a nice young man who was there just to climb the rocks.  He<br/>
informed us that we were actually between two trails and that the only<br/>
way to reach either of them was over more boulders.  He also verified<br/>
that the parking lot was southeast of our location.  We decided to<br/>
head southeast still hoping to cross the original trail.  But it was<br/>
not to be.  Almost two hours later, we finally crossed over one more<br/>
boulder and actually could see houses in the distance.  We limped our<br/>
way to civilization, not having any idea where we might be. <br/>
<br/>
Fortunately, there was a man out in his yard who informed us that we<br/>
were on a road which was directly parallel to the road that the<br/>
parking lot was on.  What he didn't tell us was that it was another<br/>
mile and a half away.  I was never so happy to see my little car as I<br/>
was yesterday.  <br/>
<br/>
I think that, yesterday, both Sheba and I were convinced<br/>
that we never wanted to see that mountain again but both of us have<br/>
already agreed today that we will make another trip to find that<br/>
elusive box number five.<br/>

Something similar happened to me last week -- I was only 1/4 mile away <br/>
from the car and no boulders in sight, but I was carrying a 35 lb <br/>
toddler, so it FELT more like 5 miles.<br/>
<br/>
Guess we have to postpone our search for this series for a year or <br/>
two, though.  And definitely not in January.<br/>

Sheba and I decided to make the<br/>trek for the Ice Age series. Maybe we should have figured that<br/>something
 was bound to happen when we ignored the snow flurries and<br/>light drizzle on the way up to the mountain. And maybe another hint<br/>might have been the slippery rocks as we began our walk to box number<br/>one. But, we are women! We are tough! So we moseyed along the<br/>trail, quickly picking up boxes one through four. (Oh, box number<br/>three proved to be my 800th find!)<br/><br/>Somehow we seemed to totally miss box number five. Maybe it was<br/>because we began to focus more on the ice which was coating the rocks<br/>as we hit the higher elevation. When we hit a particularly narrow<br/>rock which had a thick layer of ice and a nice drop down its side, we<br/>decided that no box was worth this. So we turned around and started<br/>to head down only to discover another trail heading up the west side<br/>of the mountain. It proved to be a much easier walk and we quickly<br/>ended up at box number 7 and also were able to get box number 6. We<br/>then decided to take the same easier
 trail back down the mountain. <br/>But being good little letterboxers, the call of box number 5 was just<br/>too strong. So we thought that if we just headed east from the easy<br/>trail, we would eventually reach the original trail and could search<br/>for number 5. <br/><br/>What we didn't realize was that this mountain is one big boulder<br/>field. We kept climbing over one boulder after another, always<br/>expecting to see the trail after the next one. At one point we ran<br/>into a nice young man who was there just to climb the rocks. He<br/>informed us that we were actually between two trails and that the only<br/>way to reach either of them was over more boulders. He also verified<br/>that the parking lot was southeast of our location. We decided to<br/>head southeast still hoping to cross the original trail. But it was<br/>not to be. Almost two hours later, we finally crossed over one more<br/>boulder and actually could see houses in the distance. We limped our<br/>way to
 civilization, not having any idea where we might be. <br/><br/>Fortunately, there was a man out in his yard who informed us that we<br/>were on a road which was directly parallel to the road that the<br/>parking lot was on. What he didn't tell us was that it was another<br/>mile and a half away. I was never so happy to see my little car as I<br/>was yesterday. <br/><br/>I think that, yesterday, both Sheba and I were convinced<br/>that we never wanted to see that mountain again but both of us have<br/>already agreed today that we will make another trip to find that<br/>elusive box number five.<br/><br/>--- In <a href="mailto:lbma%40yahoogroups.com" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">lbma@yahoogroups. com</a>, Suzanne Coe &lt;wilmcoe@... &gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Congratulations to Janila who achieved a significant number of finds<br/>yesterday while we were boxing on Haycock Mtn!
