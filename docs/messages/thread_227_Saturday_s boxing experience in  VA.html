Myself (Schizokeet)) Got out this weekend, between rain showers.  We <br/>
started off with the 2 new boxes in Springfield on the Cross Counter <br/>
Connector and were the first to stamp in to Haiku 1 #2 as a bonus we <br/>
moved along the HH Letter boxing around the world released by town <br/>
Crier.  My HH (Don't Forget) also made it out of my position this <br/>
weekend.  <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
After finishing Haiku 1 &amp; 2 (loved the translations on the stickers) <br/>
we headed over to Lake Accotink Park and found Stratford Hall, a <br/>
quick and easy find.  After a break for a late lunch we headed over <br/>
to Fort Hunt and found the new box Company Picnic.  We started on <br/>
the wrong trail but ended up where we belonged and found another <br/>
box.  Here It looked like it would rain.  Our windshield was getting <br/>
wet and had to use the wipers.  <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
But we trudged on to Fort Marcy.  I did a quick count of stamps in <br/>
my long book 2 more finds would put me at 300 :^)  So off to Ft. <br/>
Marcy we headed.  Finding the Vince Foster box was easy.  However we <br/>
looked and looked and looked and looked for Scarab's box.   We <br/>
followed the trail to 123 and back again.  The only things that look <br/>
promising yielded nothing.  So SES, DL, and I decided to follow the <br/>
Blue trail around the park.  However DL decided to head back in <br/>
towards the Fort, towards a large dead Tree.  SES and I continued on <br/>
the trail.  After making some comment that we were very close to GW <br/>
parkway (4 feet away) and walking threw a spider web, and it being a <br/>
little too close to dusk to see properly.  Both SES and I started <br/>
getting stung.  Although I never saw any bees and we never left the <br/>
trail.  I followed SES jogging back up the hill to the car.  We <br/>
applied after bite and some instant ice packs to our stings.  Lucky <br/>
I only got stung twice and SES not so lucky got stung 3-4 times.  <br/>
Not sure but, SES will probably take a break form boxing until her <br/>
wounds stop itching.  I'll probably head out to find my 300th box <br/>
this week. I'm thinking Teddy Roosevelt Island is a viable option to <br/>
find the newest box there.<br/>

</span></blockquote>WELL!, Fort Hunt! This sure is interesting the dual boxing habits. <br/>
Almost every box we've hit, there has been someone there that day! <br/>
(We were at the Mt. Vernon Trail Box in Ft. Hunt on Sat!, I did'nt <br/>
see the clues for "Company Picnic on the main site?) So here is an <br/>
idea, I am going to start noting the time of on our pages when we <br/>
stamp into a journal. If folks did this you might just find out how <br/>
much ya missed them by......oh, that would be just cruel!<br/>
We also planted "George's Little Box" on the grounds of the Vernon <br/>
Estate. Clues are forthcoming by the wknd. <br/>
