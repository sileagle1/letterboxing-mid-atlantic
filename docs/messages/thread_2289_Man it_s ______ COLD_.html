&gt;<br/>
&gt; I was in a park with H&amp;H today and it was too cold to<br/>
&gt; box! Found one and walkked by a few more 'cause I<br/>
&gt; didn't want to take off my gloves again. Helped with<br/>
&gt; some maintanence and planted one.<br/>
&gt; And my favorite part of boxing with Irene, Lunch! We<br/>
&gt; had a wonderful lunch at the Blue Sage grille. Some<br/>
&gt; boxers I know will box for 6 hours with only a piece<br/>
&gt; of gum to sustain them.<br/>
&gt; Then picked up my math nerd son a Math Counts<br/>
&gt; competion. If I was a good mom I would have stayed<br/>
&gt; around and watched kids do math problems but I chose<br/>
&gt; to tromp around a park in sub-zero conditions.<br/>

&gt; &gt; My hands were so cold when stamping into the 1 box<br/>

<br/>
It was a bit nippy out, that is why we went on the field trip to Dover, <br/>
although, hehe, that was not really my thinking.<br/>
<br/>
I get to Suzanne's and I am like, "How about we go get some culture."<br/>
<br/>
"You mean all the way down in Dover?"<br/>
<br/>
"Uhhh... yeah... it isn't that far."<br/>
<br/>
I really had no idea where it was, I only glanced at the clue, but it <br/>
was indoors, and warm, and the museum was interesting, and we got a AAA <br/>
discount (AAA comes through again, I should actually start carrying my <br/>
card!).<br/>
<br/>
Hmmmm... wonder if I can get a box planted in there?<br/>
