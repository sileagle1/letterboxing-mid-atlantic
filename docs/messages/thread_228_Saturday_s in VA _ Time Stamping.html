<p>Disc Lava always writes down the time we stamp into boxes.  I usually forget if I'm out by my self. We have typiclly followed groups and wondered how far we were behind them we were.</p>

<div></div>&gt;Night Owl and I were once boxing on Cape Cod when we started seeing Wanda and Pete's stamps.  "They were just here yesterday.  Too bad we didn't know they were in the area."  Then at the next box.  "OMG!  Wanda and Pete were here today!" 
<div></div>&gt; 
<div></div>&gt;While we were driving to the next box I said to Night Owl, "We should look for their car just in... There it goes!  Follow them." 
<div></div>&gt; 
<div></div>&gt;We followed them to their next stop and had an afternoon boxing together. 
<div></div>&gt; 
<div></div>&gt;So your idea of putting times in logs is interesting.

<div></div>&gt; &gt; After a break for a late lunch we headed over

<div></div>&gt; &gt; the wrong trail but ended up where we belonged and found another 
<div></div>&gt; &gt; box.  Here It looked like it would rain.  Our windshield was

<div></div>&gt;WELL!, Fort Hunt! This sure is interesting the dual boxing habits. 
<div></div>&gt;Almost every box we've hit, there has been someone there that day! 
<div></div>&gt;(We were at the Mt. Vernon Trail Box in Ft. Hunt on Sat!, I did'nt 
<div></div>&gt;see the clues for "Company Picnic on the main site?) So here is an 
<div></div>&gt;idea, I am going to start noting the time of on our pages when we 
<div></div>&gt;stamp into a journal. If folks did this you might just find out how 
<div></div>&gt;much ya missed them by......oh, that would be just cruel! 
<div></div>&gt;We also planted "George's Little Box" on the grounds of the Vernon 
<div></div>&gt;Estate. Clues are forthcoming by the wknd.

I suppose if I saw a time on the same day, I'd pick up my pace to<br/>
catch up to the boxers ahead.<br/>
