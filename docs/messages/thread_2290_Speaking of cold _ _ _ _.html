Red Breast is an excellent Irish whiskey, very smooth.  My bottle is <br/>
nearly empty so I put most of it into a flask and took it to Lewes to <br/>
drink after the plunge.<br/>
<br/>
While there, I visited Teller Wines - amazing little shop - and <br/>
decided to buy more Irish whiskey.  My choice this time?<br/>
<br/>
Black Bush<br/>

I am not making this up.<br/>
