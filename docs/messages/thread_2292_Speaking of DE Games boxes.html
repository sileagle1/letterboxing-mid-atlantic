<p>the point is pretty much mute.  </p>
<p>The AQ &amp; LB.org listings are so you can post your finds.</p>
<p>NOTE all the restaurants from exCLUsion have been pulled and will eventually be planted at KPSP -- I hope to only have exCLUsion at KPSP and replant others from there to new locations -- but time will tell.  Meanwhile look at LB.org to see if any are showing MIA in the title/body.  </p>
<p>With a broken computer at home and limited Library time, I'm not able to review all emails for any additional reports of missing boxes.  </p>
