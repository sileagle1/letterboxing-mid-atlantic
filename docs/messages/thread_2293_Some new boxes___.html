<br/>
Bucks County Haunts: Midnight Mary is finally posted.  It is a doubly <br/>
rewarding box.  I finished that up in the pre-dawn hours this morning. <br/>
Boy, was it cold out!<br/>
<br/>
Also up is a box that I think several folks are going to really enjoy. <br/>
"The Whip" is located outside a great tavern of the same name in Chester <br/>
County.<br/>
<br/>
"Scudder Falls Bridge" has finally been replaced and is now "Yardley <br/>
Yeti."  It is a new box, new stamp, but in the same location.  For now <br/>
the clues are the same, I have just changed the name, but within the <br/>
next day I will switch to new clues and officially retire "Scudder Falls <br/>
Bridge."<br/>
<br/>
All clues are listed on Atlasquest and my own website.<br/>
