but...........what about boxes that are not available to the physically<br/>
handicapped? Which are a lot of boxes actually. And handicapped<br/>
accessibility is one of the options to check on AQ. What about some extreme<br/>
boxes that people not in the greatest shape might not be able to do? Or not<br/>
even extreme, just involve a really long and hard hike that some might not<br/>
be able to do? Just throwing out some thoughts here, not meaning to argue<br/>
or make a speech about it. But generally speaking not all boxes are always<br/>
available to all boxers are they? <br/>
<br/>
Granted the exceptions are few but they do exist. Actually I think I would<br/>
have more of a problem with the box being 9 feet up so that once you get in<br/>
there, you can't get to it and then put it back. If that makes any sense? I<br/>
wouldn't have a problem with a box being in a men's room. Actually I would<br/>
probably just go in a get it anyway. BAHAHAAA! But if I chickened out, I<br/>
would be cool with not being able to get it. There are lots of boxes that<br/>
most of us have access to with no problem. So you can't get one? I don't<br/>
see the big deal. <br/>
<br/>
Someone had a box in the ladies room at a gathering once and no one had a<br/>
problem with it. <br/>

&gt; I looked at this box and found myself really having a problem with it. <br/>
&gt; I mean, sure, I box with women enough that I could easily pair up and <br/>

 &gt; always<br/>
 &gt; available to all boxers are they?<br/>
 &gt;<br/>
 &gt; Granted the exceptions are few but they do exist. Actually I think I<br/>
 &gt; would<br/>
 &gt; have more of a problem with the box being 9 feet up so that once you<br/>
 &gt; get in<br/>
 &gt; there, you can't get to it and then put it back. If that makes any<br/>
 &gt; sense? I<br/>
 &gt; wouldn't have a problem with a box being in a men's room. Actually I<br/>
 &gt; would<br/>
 &gt; probably just go in a get it anyway. BAHAHAAA! But if I chickened out, I<br/>
 &gt; would be cool with not being able to get it. There are lots of boxes that<br/>
 &gt; most of us have access to with no problem. So you can't get one? I don't<br/>
 &gt; see the big deal.<br/>

<br/>
Here is the thing, a person that is handicaped knows that they have <br/>
limitations.  There is very little a planter can do to help of with some <br/>
of these limitations.  Letterboxing, for 90% of the boxes, is not a <br/>
sport for people with those kind of limitations, just as orienteering, <br/>
most hiking, and many other outdoor activities for the most part.<br/>
<br/>
If there is a box that is extreme, you can train and bring yourself to <br/>
the physical level needed to find the box.<br/>
<br/>
However, I cannot simply become a woman, well, at least not without a <br/>
whole lot of surgery (and I think I would make a pretty ugly woman).<br/>
<br/>
I think it is the principle of the matter.  There are a whole lot of <br/>
other places in the Wal-Mart that the box could be planted, it is a very <br/>
big store (a Supercenter in fact).<br/>

<div>Yes it can.</div>
<div> </div>
<div> I haven't followed the brew-hah-hah on AQ but someone wrote me and asked me if I had, so they kind of clued me in. When the challenge was first posted it just said businesses in general didn't it, not one store specifically? I'm kind if blown away that people couldn't think of anyplace else to put the boxes. It does seem like a little bit of overkill, but I kind of don't think it would have turned into the terrorist story on the 11 o' clock news like I was told some people seemed to think it would. </div>

They could have been with a woman at the time, and thus able to get the <br/>

Very often I am with a woman (or three).  It just so happened this box <br/>

thought it would be easy for me to get to or from until I read the clues.<br/>
