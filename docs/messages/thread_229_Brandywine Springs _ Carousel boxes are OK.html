                    <div id="ygrps-yiv-57768847">Like Scarab in his recent Andy Rooney "rant", which he allowed me to <br/>
reprint on my site at:<br/>
<a href="http://www.letterboxing.info/articles/00000025.shtml" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.letterboxing.info/articles/00000025.shtml</a><br/>
I've been concerned about the various "substandard" containers in which <br/>
I've found being used in many letterboxes that I've found recently.<br/>
<br/>
Having just replaced several letterboxes that were planted in 1999, I've <br/>
seen firsthand the damage that can be done by weather over the years. Maybe <br/>
it's unreasonable that letterboxes should be expected to survive for five <br/>
years, but I have also found boxes that had been planted 4 or 5 years ago <br/>
and were still holding up -- and a large reason why is the sturdy <br/>
containers that were used.<br/>
<br/>
The "gladware" type boxes just don't hold up well out in the field, and <br/>
putting the whole letterbox inside a big plastic bag doesn't provide any <br/>
protection at all since they tend to rip or get holes quickly after being <br/>
pulled out from under rocks or logs just one or two times -- at which <br/>
point, they only serve to keep water close to the letterbox!<br/>
<br/>
The best and least expensive boxes available on a regular basis that I've <br/>
found to date are available from Dollar Tree. They sell sturdy plastic <br/>
containers for $1 (everything's a dollar in the store, natch) called Milan <br/>
Classic, made by Holiday. There are two sizes, one roughly 5 1/2" square <br/>
(with a green lid) and one that's 7" square (with a blue or white lid); <br/>
they're deep enough to accommodate a stamp and log easily and the lids seal <br/>
securely (as evidenced by my "burp" test -- sealing the lid and then <br/>
pressing hard on it to see if air escapes. If air can get out, water will <br/>
get in -- try this on your potential letterbox containers and you'll <br/>
quickly see just how sturdy they are.). I started using them last year and <br/>
so far the ones that I've had out in the woods have stood up well through <br/>
the winter.<br/>
<br/>
I've been stocking up on them, since they're a really great bargain, <br/>
especially compared to Rubbermaid boxes that are two or three times more <br/>
expensive and don't always hold up. And the price isn't that much more than <br/>
the disposal-type containers. I was happy to see that Celtic Cat &amp; <br/>
Wednesday Bowler used one of the green lidded ones for their newest <br/>
letterbox, and would like to see better containers overall.<br/>
<br/>
The other big reason that letterboxes survive and weather well is if the <br/>
logbooks are double bagged, preferably in sturdy "freezer-style" ziploc <br/>
bags that *don't* have the tab zippers. These are a bit harder to seal, but <br/>
you can burp out the air and check the seal when you replace the log in the <br/>
box to make sure that it is properly sealed. Every letterboxer should carry <br/>
some extra baggies in their letterboxing kit which can be used to replace <br/>
bags that get torn through normal use.<br/>
<br/>
Just my two cents on letterbox containers!<br/>

Maybe all those missing PLB's are due to the activities of a portly <br/>
mailman from midtown Manhatten who it trying to build his PLB count.<br/>
<br/>
Sorry about the plants!  ;-)  We're just causing all sorts of <br/>
Seinfeldian things - first Fleur calling Raindeer Newman, now this.  <br/>
And to think, I'm starting up "No Soup for YOU!"...<br/>
<br/>
The Pool Wildlife Sanctuary stamps were carved Memorial Day weekend, <br/>
but we have just been oh so busy boosting our F's (so that we can be <br/>
considered elite - NOT!) that we forgot to plant.<br/>
<br/>
I would like to confirm what Silent Doug has said about the Lock <br/>
Ridge and Just Flyin' Through Boxes.  They are gawn!  I tried <br/>
emailing the placers, but I think they have removed themselves from <br/>
the community.  In a way I am glad that I have not searched for the <br/>
Goldfish yet.  Thanks for the heads up!<br/>
<br/>
Tom and hope to invade Jacobsburg Sunday Morning on the way to Cub <br/>
Scout sleepover camp.<br/>

Thanks again,<br/>

The logbooks are either scrolls which you have to wrestle with or too small<br/>

Don't know how well these will hold up in weather.  <br/>

Now, for a nice friendly discussion . . . <br/>
I agree, the clues should indicate a micro or not -- otherwise I'm <br/>
looking for a big sandwich and probably standing (crushing) the micro.<br/>

No problemo.  Sometimes microboxes are all thatg will fit discretely <br/>
in a particular hiding spot.  :-(<br/>
<br/>
I was wondering how you got your notebooks cut!  I was doing the "a <br/>
few sheets at a time" and snip the wire spiral routine.<br/>
<br/>
More Power!<br/>
<br/>
Any microbox that I plant will be indicated as such.  I did plant a <br/>
mini (per your description) at Pool Wildlife Sanctuary last weekend.<br/>
