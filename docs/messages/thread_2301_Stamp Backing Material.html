</span></blockquote>What I do is I mount them on a strip of basewood with a layer of fun <br/>
foam between the rubber and the wood.  The foam gives the stamp some <br/>
give and helps get rid of the dead spots.<br/>
<br/>
At Wal-Mart they have fun foam that is sticky on one side, which is perfect.<br/>
<br/>
Basewood can be gotten at any craft store.  It is heavier then balsa, <br/>
which is too light and fragile.  when choosing the wood, take a good <br/>
look at it and pick one that is nice and flat and level.  Most are <br/>
pretty good, rarely have I come across one that was warped.<br/>

your impression using the "printing method" (as I call it.)  This is <br/>
also good for those really big (&gt;3x4") stamps.<br/>
<br/>
Place rubber stamp - image up - on LEFT side of log<br/>
Bring right page over top (keep it steady as you lower it)<br/>
Rub back of page with your hand<br/>
Gently lift the page back up and remove the stamp<br/>
<br/>
This becomes a little more tricky when using a large log with <br/>
multiple impressions per page.<br/>
<br/>
In which case, place rubber stamp image down on the page<br/>
Close the log<br/>
Flip over so you can open to back of page - exposing it for a hand job<br/>
<br/>
At least a large mounted stamp won't be in multiple pieces when you <br/>
find it!!<br/>
<br/>
I also like the foam core so I can stamp the image on it and then <br/>
cover in clear packaging tape -- so finders can easily see what color <br/>
ink pens to use ;^)  and which way it is up (unless I glued it on <br/>
wrong -- and I use the Quick-Tite super glue -- cause times awasting.<br/>
