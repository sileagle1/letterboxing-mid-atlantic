friend (Janila) and I had to stop suddenly. After the road cleared I <br/>
proceeded on my journey home. Tired but happy with a wonderful <br/>
letterboxing adventure and great day!<br/>
<br/>
Reaching for my water bottle<br/>
<br/>
mmm Where did all the water go? Did I drink it? Floor of the car is <br/>
not wet Oh well must have been thirstier than I thought.<br/>
<br/>
That night Black Swan figures out the bonus clues Janila and I could <br/>
not fathom at the moment on the trail (I think we were both in lunch <br/>
mode, brains not functioning right with hungry bellies!). Swan and I <br/>
make plans to return to the scene of the crime on Sunday<br/>
<br/>
Sunday morning, running late to hit the road for the adventure, I go <br/>
out to warm up the car and wait for the Swan. I usually pull forward <br/>
a bit, but why won't the shifty thing move into drive?<br/>
<br/>
Ah, now I know where the water went! I guess freezing weather makes <br/>
water FREEZE-20 minutes later and some time with a hair dryer, <br/>
finally on our way!<br/>
<br/>
Yes, we did accomplish our mission and a few to boot!<br/>
<br/>
I am such a dolt!<br/>
