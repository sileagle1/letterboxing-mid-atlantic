&gt; &gt; Hi LbMA folks! As Hikers n Hounds mentioned, I am coming to PA<br/>
&gt; &gt; shortly, in fact I leave<br/>
&gt; &gt; super early tomorrow AM. Amanda from Seattle and I are coming to a<br/>
&gt; &gt; Nancy Drew<br/>
&gt; &gt; conference in Chambersburg for a couple of days, and then I am<br/>
&gt; &gt; ditching Amanda at the<br/>
&gt; &gt; Philly airport, picking up my 7th grader and heading to Bucks <br/>
county.<br/>
&gt; &gt; I am staying in New<br/>
&gt; &gt; Hope and plan to visit the boxilicious Tyler State Park on either<br/>
&gt; &gt; Monday or Tuesday (the<br/>
&gt; &gt; 19th or 20th). HnH mentioned a pub nearby that would be <br/>
appropriate<br/>
&gt; &gt; for a quickie meet<br/>
&gt; &gt; &amp; great, but where my minor would be welcome. Anyone avaialble? <br/>
Any<br/>
&gt; &gt; preference of<br/>
&gt; &gt; dates? Any advice anyone want to give a poor hapless Californian?<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I would love to meet up with you for some boxing and exchanges. <br/>
Monday <br/>
&gt; is pretty much out though, as I plan to be unconcous from back to <br/>
back <br/>
&gt; gatherings. Tuesday would be much better for me.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; You could skip your Nancy Drew thing on Sunday and head north to <br/>
State <br/>
&gt; College to hunt some tupperware ;-)<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Hope to make it work. There are lots of great boxes in Bucks <br/>
County. <br/>

&gt; &gt; &gt; Hi LbMA folks! As Hikers n Hounds mentioned, I<br/>
&gt; am coming to PA<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; shortly, in fact I leave<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; super early tomorrow AM. Amanda from Seattle and<br/>
&gt; I are coming to a<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; Nancy Drew<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; conference in Chambersburg for a couple of days,<br/>
&gt; and then I am<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; ditching Amanda at the<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; Philly airport, picking up my 7th grader and<br/>
&gt; heading to Bucks <br/>
&gt; county.<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; I am staying in New<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; Hope and plan to visit the boxilicious Tyler<br/>
&gt; State Park on either<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; Monday or Tuesday (the<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; 19th or 20th). HnH mentioned a pub nearby that<br/>
&gt; would be <br/>
&gt; appropriate<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; for a quickie meet<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &amp; great, but where my minor would be welcome.<br/>
&gt; Anyone avaialble? <br/>
&gt; Any<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; preference of<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; dates? Any advice anyone want to give a poor<br/>
&gt; hapless Californian?<br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; I would love to meet up with you for some boxing<br/>
&gt; and exchanges. <br/>
&gt; Monday <br/>
&gt; &gt; is pretty much out though, as I plan to be<br/>
&gt; unconcous from back to <br/>
&gt; back <br/>
&gt; &gt; gatherings. Tuesday would be much better for me.<br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; You could skip your Nancy Drew thing on Sunday and<br/>
&gt; head north to <br/>
&gt; State <br/>
&gt; &gt; College to hunt some tupperware ;-)<br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; Hope to make it work. There are lots of great<br/>
&gt; boxes in Bucks <br/>
&gt; County. <br/>
&gt; &gt; Where in New Hope are you staying?<br/>

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Hi LbMA folks! As Hikers n Hounds mentioned, I<br/>
&gt; &gt; am coming to PA<br/>

&gt; &gt; I are coming to a<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Nancy Drew<br/>

&gt; &gt; and then I am<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; ditching Amanda at the<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Philly airport, picking up my 7th grader and<br/>
&gt; &gt; heading to Bucks <br/>
&gt; &gt; county.<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I am staying in New<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Hope and plan to visit the boxilicious Tyler<br/>
&gt; &gt; State Park on either<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Monday or Tuesday (the<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; 19th or 20th). HnH mentioned a pub nearby that<br/>
&gt; &gt; would be <br/>

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &amp; great, but where my minor would be welcome.<br/>
&gt; &gt; Anyone avaialble? <br/>

&gt; &gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; I would love to meet up with you for some boxing<br/>
&gt; &gt; and exchanges. <br/>
&gt; &gt; Monday <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; is pretty much out though, as I plan to be<br/>
&gt; &gt; unconcous from back to <br/>
&gt; &gt; back <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; gatherings. Tuesday would be much better for me.<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; You could skip your Nancy Drew thing on Sunday and<br/>
&gt; &gt; head north to <br/>
&gt; &gt; State <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; College to hunt some tupperware ;-)<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; <br/>

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Hi LbMA folks! As Hikers n Hounds mentioned, I<br/>
&gt; &gt; am coming to PA<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; shortly, in fact I leave<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; super early tomorrow AM. Amanda from Seattle<br/>
&gt; and<br/>
&gt; &gt; I are coming to a<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Nancy Drew<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; conference in Chambersburg for a couple of<br/>
&gt; days,<br/>
&gt; &gt; and then I am<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; ditching Amanda at the<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Philly airport, picking up my 7th grader and<br/>
&gt; &gt; heading to Bucks <br/>
&gt; &gt; county.<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I am staying in New<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Hope and plan to visit the boxilicious Tyler<br/>
&gt; &gt; State Park on either<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Monday or Tuesday (the<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; 19th or 20th). HnH mentioned a pub nearby that<br/>
&gt; &gt; would be <br/>
&gt; &gt; appropriate<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; for a quickie meet<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &amp; great, but where my minor would be welcome.<br/>
&gt; &gt; Anyone avaialble? <br/>
&gt; &gt; Any<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; preference of<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; dates? Any advice anyone want to give a poor<br/>
&gt; &gt; hapless Californian?<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; I would love to meet up with you for some boxing<br/>
&gt; &gt; and exchanges. <br/>
&gt; &gt; Monday <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; is pretty much out though, as I plan to be<br/>
&gt; &gt; unconcous from back to <br/>
&gt; &gt; back <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; gatherings. Tuesday would be much better for me.<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; You could skip your Nancy Drew thing on Sunday<br/>
&gt; and<br/>
&gt; &gt; head north to <br/>
&gt; &gt; State <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; College to hunt some tupperware ;-)<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; Hope to make it work. There are lots of great<br/>
&gt; &gt; boxes in Bucks <br/>
&gt; &gt; County. <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; Where in New Hope are you staying?<br/>

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Careful. Couscous is a gateway grain. Next thing<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; you know <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; you'll be eating lentils and tabbouleh.<br/>

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Hi LbMA folks! As Hikers n Hounds mentioned, I<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; am coming to PA<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; shortly, in fact I leave<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; super early tomorrow AM. Amanda from Seattle<br/>
&gt; &gt; and<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; I are coming to a<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Nancy Drew<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; conference in Chambersburg for a couple of<br/>
&gt; &gt; days,<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; and then I am<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; ditching Amanda at the<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Philly airport, picking up my 7th grader and<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; heading to Bucks <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; county.<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I am staying in New<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Hope and plan to visit the boxilicious Tyler<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; State Park on either<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Monday or Tuesday (the<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; 19th or 20th). HnH mentioned a pub nearby that<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; would be <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; appropriate<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; for a quickie meet<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &amp; great, but where my minor would be welcome.<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; Anyone avaialble? <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; Any<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; preference of<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; dates? Any advice anyone want to give a poor<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; hapless Californian?<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I would love to meet up with you for some boxing<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; and exchanges. <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; Monday <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; is pretty much out though, as I plan to be<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; unconcous from back to <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; back <br/>

 either<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; Monday or Tuesday (the<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; 19th or 20th).

&gt; Just in case you are really interested - my grandfather was a butcher<br/>
&gt; and my mother always told me that anything that was left over from<br/>
&gt; butchering the pig went into a pot and became scrapple.  I have never<br/>
&gt; even been able to taste it after her description but people around<br/>
&gt; here love it - with syrup.<br/>

&gt; &gt; &gt; county.<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I am staying in New<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Hope and plan to visit the boxilicious Tyler<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; State Park on either<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Monday or Tuesday (the<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; 19th or 20th). HnH mentioned a pub nearby that<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; would be <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; appropriate<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; for a quickie meet<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &amp; great, but where my minor would be welcome.<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; Anyone avaialble? <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; Any<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; preference of<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; dates? Any advice anyone want to give a poor<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; hapless Californian?<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I would love to meet up with you for some boxing<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; and exchanges. <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; Monday <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; is pretty much out though, as I plan to be<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; unconcous from back to <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; back <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; gatherings. Tuesday would be much better for me.<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; You could skip your Nancy Drew thing on Sunday and<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; head north to <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; State <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; College to hunt some tupperware ;-)<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Hope to make it work. There are lots of great<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; boxes in Bucks <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; County. <br/>

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Monday or Tuesday (the<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; 19th or 20th). HnH mentioned a pub nearby that<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; would be <br/>

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; for a quickie meet<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &amp; great, but where my minor would be welcome.<br/>

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I would love to meet up with you for some boxing<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; and exchanges. <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Monday <br/>

&gt; &gt; &gt; Scoville units are a measure of the amount of<br/>

                    <div id="ygrps-yiv-598309817">There was a trend for a while among hot sauce makers to vie for the <br/>
hottest stuff around.  This would involve extracting the capsaicin <br/>
fron habaneros using solvents like ethyl alcohol (near and dear to <br/>
the perceived [by out of region folks] 'drunks' of the LBMA!] or <br/>
acetone.  This extract was added back to pepper mash to make hot <br/>
sauce on steroids.  What resulted was some super potent stuff that <br/>
tested of hot solvent, without any real flavor.<br/>
<br/>
Give me a flavorful, curry-based hot sauce like Rasta Fire or one of <br/>
the Sriracha style asian sauces with lotsa garlic any day.  Put it <br/>
over plain white rice and yum.<br/>
