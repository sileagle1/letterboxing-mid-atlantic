I just received a message from a fellow boxer regarding the location <br/>
of Hanover, Virginia on the letterbox map. Hanover is directly <br/>
adjacent to Richmond city. It is in central Virginia and at least an <br/>
hour from northern Virginia if not an hour and a half. I am curious <br/>
to know the reasons why the location has been changed? People who <br/>
live around Hanover will not know the boxes are there since they will <br/>
not think to look in northern Virginia to find boxes that are in <br/>
central Virginia.<br/>

Hi! This Richmond area gives us fits! What you see now is based on <br/>
input from letterboxers who live in that area. But nothing is perfect <br/>
and we're always ready to improve things.<br/>
<br/>
I think that y'all ought to get together on your regional yahoogroup <br/>
or at a Gathering this spring, and come up with a coherent breakdown <br/>
of the area from a local perspective. We will do anything we can at <br/>
LbNA to help make the maps more reader friendly and more usefull to <br/>
the people that use them. Thanks for the note, Jay in CT<br/>

We're in that area, and oddly enough were just talking about the way
Hanover was placed on the LbNA map. <br/>
<br/>
Decidedly, Hanover is in the Richmond Metro area. My husband is the
manager of the Richmond public radio station and has been working with
local Emergency Preparedness folks regarding an emergency
notification/information system. Hanover is among the area
cities/counties that are participating in this program and is well
within the broadcast area for the station.<br/>
<br/>
I'd agree that some Richmond-area folks might miss boxes listed in
Hanover if they're not included in the Central VA section, especially
if they're newer boxers who haven't been navigating the site for long.
Spotsylvania, Stafford, Fredericksburg listed in the NoVA region -
fine. Hanover on the other hand is so close to Richmond that you can't
even call it a bedroom community. <br/>
