Okay. Central VA:<br/>
Hanover - yes<br/>
New Kent - well, it's a bedroom community for Richmond, but I bet it's
also a bedroom community for Williamsburg/Tidewater.<br/>
Charles City - I definitely associate this county with the Williamsburg
area.<br/>
    However, looking at a map, New Kent and Charles City could be
llisted with Richmond - it could go either way.<br/>
Louisa - sure. You have to traverse Louisa county to get from Richmond
to Charlottesville so if C'ville is Central VA, then so is Louisa. Same
for Fluvanna and Goochland, if they're not already in Central VA. <br/>
Nelson County should be moved out of the Central VA region and into
Shenandoah - no mountains in Central VA.<br/>
<br/>
Southwest/Roanoke:<br/>
Pittsylvania - I'm on the fence on this one. By rights there would be a
'Southside VA' region, but there aren't any major population centers
and darn few boxes. Overall, I'm in favor of keeping Pittsylvania &amp;
Danville in Central VA, barring feedback from the folks who have
planted boxes in those areas.<br/>
Alleghany - yes. It makes no sense at all for this to be in the Central
VA region.<br/>
Botetourt - yes<br/>
Bedford - yes<br/>
I'd also add Amherst to this region, or to the Shenandoah region. The
mountain thing again.<br/>
<br/>
Just my $2...<br/>

I meant to also add that moving Hanover to NoVA region makes little
sense on another front - there are so incredibly many boxes listed in
the NoVA region that adding even more is just going to make it harder
to navigate. If anything, the NoVA region should be subdivided to make
looking for boxes more manageable. I'd suggest splitting off the
Fredericksburg/Stafford/Spotsylvania area. This region could also
include Orange, Culpeper, Caroline, King George, and maybe the Eastern
Shore counties. Maybe Louisa.<br/>

One find each way on such a long trip??!? No way DH would get away with
that! ;-&gt; He knows that if I go alomg on business or kid-related car
trips, I'm due some serious boxing! (I hate long car trips...)<br/>
<br/>
Which Roanoke box did you get? We were out that way about a month ago
on a kid-related trip. And, yeah, the soaked logbook in the Dog Box is
sad. We emailed the planter but haven't heard back. Haven't heard back
on the last several of his boxes we've found, actually. We were getting
responses as recently as 2-3 months ago, but no more. We had actually
figured he stopped responding because we were reporting so much
maintenance that needed to be done... ;-&gt; <br/>
<br/>
If you come down this way again, you should check out some of our boxes
in Petersburg. Several drive-bys, although you have to do your homework
for a couple...<br/>

&gt; Which Roanoke box did you get? We were out that way<br/>
&gt; about a month ago on <br/>
&gt; a kid-related trip. And, yeah, the soaked logbook in<br/>
&gt; the Dog Box is sad. <br/>
&gt; We emailed the planter but haven't heard back.<br/>
&gt; Haven't heard back on the <br/>
&gt; last several of his boxes we've found, actually. We<br/>
&gt; were getting <br/>
&gt; responses as recently as 2-3 months ago, but no<br/>
&gt; more. We had actually <br/>
&gt; figured he stopped responding because we were<br/>
&gt; reporting so much <br/>
&gt; maintenance that needed to be done... ;-&gt;<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; If you come down this way again, you should check<br/>
&gt; out some of our boxes <br/>
&gt; in Petersburg. Several drive-bys, although you have<br/>
&gt; to do your homework <br/>
&gt; for a couple...<br/>

&gt; &gt; We were heading from Columbia, MD to Hickory NC<br/>
&gt; and<br/>
&gt; &gt; were worried about snow on 81, so we took the<br/>
&gt; Richmond<br/>
&gt; &gt; route. Since I was doing my dh a favor by<br/>
&gt; &gt; accompanying him to his new piece of property in<br/>
&gt; NC he<br/>
&gt; &gt; accomodated one stop each way. Got the two boxes<br/>
&gt; &gt; there in Ashland at the park, and one near Roanoke<br/>
&gt; on<br/>
&gt; &gt; the way home. Both were a nice break, although I<br/>
&gt; &gt; thought it was nearly gonna kill him, losing 45<br/>
&gt; &gt; minutes off the road, lol. But a deal's a deal.<br/>
&gt; When<br/>
&gt; &gt; I was logging in the Beaver Dam and In the Dog Box<br/>
&gt; I<br/>
&gt; &gt; noticed your find as well. Sorry that the one log<br/>
&gt; is<br/>
&gt; &gt; nearly destroyed.<br/>

&gt; &gt; &gt; Sort of. Just DH's usual every-other-weekend<br/>
&gt; trek<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; from south of Richmond<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; to north of Baltimore. I rode along on Monday<br/>
&gt; and we<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; boxed in Ashland on<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; our way home. You?<br/>
