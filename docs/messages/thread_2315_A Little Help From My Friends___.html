frequent swellings was actually found and recovered and returned to me by a 'boxer with a <br/>
heart of gold.<br/>
<br/>
The replacement stamp is nestled all snug in it's aerie.  But I did notice something about my <br/>
old stamp:  Apparently some kind hearted person - in an effort to help out later 'boxers - <br/>
marked the stamp with an arrow indicating the "Up" position.  I have no doubt thta this was <br/>
done in the spirit of helping others.  Letterboxers have continually renewed my faith in <br/>
humankind.  So please take my petty complaint for what it's worth.  But the kind hearted <br/>
person put the arrow on the wrong way.<br/>
<br/>
So if I may offer a word of advice... if you're not sure... <br/>

I ask because my dear husband put an arrow on one of the stamps he <br/>
carved.  I assumed it meant up and stamped it into my book only to <br/>
find out it was upside down. He seemed to think it was logical to put <br/>
the arrow facing down.  I seem to think it logical to put it facing <br/>
up.  <br/>

Who's right??<br/>
