Northern Spy was MIA on our first attempt - I think that Fishman <br/>
found at least Northern Spy #2.  It's in that dog-walking area and I <br/>
think that the critters find a scent and track it.<br/>

As always, Thanks for the horsebrutality, geckospot!  We were<br/>
certainly most triumphant in our quests this weekend - if we could<br/>
only have had time to work on the other two Locomotivation boxes!<br/>
<br/>
I believe of the DE Games boxes, only Indian River Lifesaving Station<br/>

there off the 'main drag'.<br/>
<br/>
I rather fear for "Lenape Tribe / Bandolier / whatever it was called"<br/>

We were<br/>certainly most triumphant in our quests this weekend - if we could<br/>only have had time to work on the other two Locomotivation boxes!<br/><br/>I believe of the DE Games boxes, only Indian River Lifesaving Station<br/>had other finders since the games ended. Probably because it's right<br/>there off the 'main drag'.<br/><br/>I rather fear for "Lenape Tribe / Bandolier / whatever it was called"<br/>because it's just sitting there under the light pole with no real<br/>coverage.

<br/>
You are correct, Friend of Otis...I misspoke.  Of those boxes we sought<br/>
and found, we were the only finders since the games.  Except for one;<br/>
possibly two.  Waiter!  More coffee!<br/>

I don't have ANY of the ones Fishman references:<br/>
