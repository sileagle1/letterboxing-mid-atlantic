it is time to offically announce the "Who Needs a Theme?" gathering.<br/>
<br/>
It will be held on May 19 (not the 5th as previously planned) at <br/>
Washington's Crossing State Park in Titusville, NJ.<br/>
<br/>
The theme of the gathering?  Well, it is anything goes.  a potluck of <br/>
boxes are to be planted in this large park, and I am looking for <br/>
donations of more to be placed.  Boxes will be needed by May 5th to be <br/>
placed in the park, so drop me a line and send along any old stamp you <br/>
have laying around, doesn't matter what it is of.<br/>
<br/>
The gathering itself will begin at about 10 at the Nature Center <br/>
pavillion.  Bring food.  This will be my typical laid back type of <br/>
gethering, with a few event stamps going around, but lots of boxes in <br/>
the woods.<br/>
<br/>
Gathering not enough for you?  Stay that night at the park's campground. <br/>
  Site D has been procured for after gathing fun.  There WILL be night <br/>
boxing as well.<br/>
