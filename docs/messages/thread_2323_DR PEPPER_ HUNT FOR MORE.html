I only had two bottle caps before the contest was called off... I sat <br/>
down with four more today    looks like you had to have 30 bottle <br/>
caps before the clues got specific...<br/>
<br/>
Here are the clues I had to work with....<br/>
<br/>
One:<br/>
We'll make this search easy, forget 50 states. There are 13 of these <br/>
and in one the coin waits. <br/>
<br/>
Two:<br/>
To find the coin sooner than later, find the shore of a stream <br/>
flowing from the equator <br/>
<br/>

But planting it in a historic cemetary?!?<br/><br/>In my area we have a popular Medallion Hunt for our winterfest. It is worth $1,000 to the finder....$2,000 if you are a subscriber to the local paper, who is the sponsor. Luckily they only hide the medallion in county, town and city parks...and away from anything sensitive. <br/><br/>Desperately Seeking Sun is held in county parks each Feb..right at the start of Winterfest. There aren't enough clues to pin point which park it is in by then, but I always say if there is a medallion in our host park, a letterboxer WILL find it!<br/><br/>LW PhD<br/>"Nice Counts"<br/><p>
