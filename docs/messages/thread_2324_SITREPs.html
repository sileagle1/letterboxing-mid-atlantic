<br/>
Saturady afternoon was still springlike, so I went with HoneyPig to <br/>
try the Rockburn Branch Trail boxes. There was a lot of ice; we were <br/>
skating along the road and dear HoneyPig [14 yo daughter] discovered <br/>
that she really could use a pair of boots since tennis shoes have no <br/>
traction.  Whoops!  Thar she goes again!<br/>
<br/>
Then we did the ENTIRE purple loop before we realized we<br/>
had NOT seen "the arch that's not a larch."  I ignored HoneyPig's <br/>
look that was pleading for mercy, and I somehow convinced her to GO <br/>
AROUND AGAIN.  I spotted what "used to be" an arch, maybe, and sure <br/>
enough we found that 1st box.  Kind of like finding a Maine box, I <br/>
suppose [Go down the road until you come to where the Fishah's bahn <br/>
was before it buhned down two yeahs ago..."]<br/>
<br/>
Then we wandered WAY UP STREAM looking for a dam before we figured <br/>
out we must have missed a junction, so we bushwhacked downstream, <br/>
found the dam, took the compass reading and found...a completely <br/>
empty tupperware box under a rock.  Right place, obviously, but no <br/>
note, no log, no stamp.  Don't know what to think there.  Meanwhile <br/>
HoneyPig figured out that the ice over a certain little pond really <br/>
wasn't that thick.  Thar she went again!<br/>
<br/>
We found the SITE for box 3, but maybe it's buried under a ton of  <br/>
dirt and snow, although we kicked up a fair amount looking for a <br/>
rock somewhere. No box in sight. However, right at the place where I <br/>
thought for sure the box SHOULD be was a frozen carcass of a blue <br/>
jay.  I teach a homeschool/high school biology class and we're doing <br/>
birds in 2 weeks, so that beautiful specimen is now in my freezer. <br/>
[Scared my 17 year old, who was looking for a frozen pizza, heh heh.]<br/>
<br/>
So 1 complete box, 1 empty, and 1 surprise treasure!  And a lot of <br/>
good exercise and a daughter with a really cheerful spirit to put up <br/>
with it all.<br/>
<br/>
And exacto knives come in handy for removing bramble splinters from <br/>
your own thumb.<br/>
