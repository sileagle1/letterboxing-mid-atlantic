<p class="ygrps-yiv-2008249641MsoNormal"><font face="Arial" size="2"><span style="font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;">Nice report, Mommo.  I’ll take a shot at writing
up our Saturday outing.</span></font></p>

<p class="ygrps-yiv-2008249641MsoNormal"><font face="Arial" size="2"><span style="font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;">Our Saturday errands took us toward </span></font><font face="Arial" size="2"><span style="font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;">Lancaster</span></font><font face="Arial" size="2"><span style="font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;">, </span></font><font face="Arial" size="2"><span style="font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;">PA</span></font><font face="Arial" size="2"><span style="font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;">, so the
Scattered Showers took a small detour to Adamstown to explore Evilmommy
territory.  We stopped at the library first.  Crossing our fingers
that a 7 year old and a 3 year old could handle words like “quiet”
and “discrete”, we went inside.  A few minutes spent in the
children’s corner hopefully diffused any suspicions of the patrons and
staff before we stole off to the reference area.  Rainmaker was a bit
frustrated, not finding the box where he thought it ought to be, but I spied it
the minute I looked at the shelf and laughed at what I read.  I’m
sure it’s a mommy thing…  After stamping in, we returned to
the kid’s section, planning to read a book to the kids as a treat.  Instead
the kids had a pre-lunch meltdown.  The youngest was hauled out of the
library crying “I want my daddy to read to meeeeeee.”</span></font></p>
<p class="ygrps-yiv-2008249641MsoNormal"><font face="Arial" size="2"><span style="font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;"> </span></font></p>
<p class="ygrps-yiv-2008249641MsoNormal"><font face="Arial" size="2"><span style="font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;">The next box was nearby on State Game Lands.   The
parking lot was unplowed but empty.  We pulled into the existing ruts,
hoping that the minivan would make it out later.  We half-walked,
half-slid along the trail, following some established footprints and wondering
if they would lead right to the box.  The box was straightforward to find,
at least in this season, and with the snow mostly frozen, we didn’t leave
many tracks of our own.  Our minivan successfully pulled out of the parking
lot, and we were off to lunch at Dave’s Diner.  The roasted chicken
sandwich and the “shorebird” sandwich were really good.</span></font></p>
<p class="ygrps-yiv-2008249641MsoNormal"><font face="Arial" size="2"><span style="font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;"> </span></font></p>
<p class="ygrps-yiv-2008249641MsoNormal"><font face="Arial" size="2"><span style="font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;">There was plenty of daylight left when we got home, so we
decided to plant a box as well.  SkatingHippo gave our youngest a box for
his birthday in December.  The location was scouted a month ago, so we
returned to shuffle over the snow and ice to hide it.  We hope it’s
a family-friendly box.  Its biggest shortcoming would be pulling the
children away from the playground equipment long enough to find the box.</span></font></p>
<p class="ygrps-yiv-2008249641MsoNormal"><font face="Arial" size="2"><span style="font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;"> </span></font></p>
<p class="ygrps-yiv-2008249641MsoNormal"><font face="Arial" size="2"><span style="font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;">All in all, we had 2 finds, 1 plant, and a chance to Get Out. 
Not bad at all.</span></font></p>
