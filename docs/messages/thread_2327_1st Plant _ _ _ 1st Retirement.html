first planted letterbox, Red Sox Nation - A.  The box will officially <br/>
retired Sunday, April 1st . . . no seriously, it will.  The Wilmington <br/>
Blue Rocks reverted back to being the Kansas City Royals Single A <br/>
affiliate some time this past fall.  So, technically the Red Sox are <br/>
no longer affiliated with the Blue Rocks now, but I'll wait until the <br/>
first game of the Sox regular season to pull the box.  <br/>
<br/>
I plan to make another plant in Rockford park soon to maybe attract a <br/>
little more traffic to it before it gets the ole "86" . .  which is <br/>
just a bad number for Red Sox fans in general.<br/>
<br/>
GO SOX!<br/>
