blame anyone other than myself. <br/>
<br/>
However, I've noticed in the past few boxes planted by newbies that <br/>
there were ink pads included. These stamps were nothing special that <br/>
would require a special color of ink, either.<br/>
<br/>
I've just double-checked the Getting Started page on LBNA, and the <br/>
only one who says you should include an ink pad is Sojourner in her <br/>
Letterboxing 101 article. Neither "Start Finding Letterboxes" <br/>
nor "Getting Started (Creating a Letterbox)" mentions an ink pad.<br/>
<br/>
There was a box in Florida where the clues said something like "no <br/>
ink pad is included, as in the Mid-Atlantic custom," and I was like, <br/>
really?<br/>

</span></blockquote>I just take it as a given that boxes are not going to have ink.<br/>
<br/>
I don't add them to my own because of both size and because of whether. <br/>
  Over the winter they will freeze and thaw several times, which will <br/>
destroy the pad and make a mess of the box.<br/>
<br/>
Was the note sent online, or was it in the log of the box?  If you can, <br/>
invite them to join the list.<br/>

&gt; <br/>
&gt; Just had a note about one of my boxes from an<br/>
&gt; unfamilar boxer(i.e. someone I <br/>
&gt; don't know).<br/>
&gt; Anyway they suggested I put a note in my clues that<br/>
&gt; there was no ink pad <br/>
&gt; provided as most<br/>
&gt; boxers don't carry thier own. I will amend my clues<br/>
&gt; but doesn't everone <br/>
&gt; carry ink pads? Or<br/>
&gt; markers? Maybe not as many as Irene but at least a<br/>
&gt; black stamp pad or your <br/>
&gt; color choice for<br/>
&gt; your sig stamp? It's been along time since I found a<br/>
&gt; box with an ink pad. I <br/>
&gt; think there is a<br/>
&gt; trend not include them, especialy with the trend to<br/>
&gt; smaller and smaller <br/>
&gt; boxes. Except in my<br/>
&gt; case, I know I carve honking big stamps.<br/>
