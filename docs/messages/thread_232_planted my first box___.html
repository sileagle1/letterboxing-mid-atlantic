planted my first box in schuylkill county, haven't had the time to <br/>
post the clues yet though-- look for it soon!  While I was in the <br/>
area I visited the Ashland boxes planted by FdL- thoroughly <br/>
enjoyable.  I laughed so hard watching my father negotiate the huge <br/>
mud puddle, it was worth the price of gas to get there!  I also did <br/>
the "who's the author" boxes in doylestown, that is such a fun <br/>
series! It's Wednesday and I am already looking forward the coming <br/>
weekend and the boxes I have planned.  Still trying to figure out <br/>
the "tunis brady" box-- has anyone found it yet?  I think I have <br/>
trudged through every boulder field in tinicum township to no avail-- <br/>
but i know I am getting closer-- it's only a matter of time!</div>
