Glad you all had fun.  Myke and I did spend a lot of time slip <br/>
sliding away while planting his Gorey boxes.<br/>

challenges.  Like setting box #1 down &amp; watching it slide gracefully <br/>
down the hill!  We overshot box #2 &amp; ended up in a bottle graveyard, <br/>
where we found the most bizarre thing I'VE ever seen letterboxing--<br/>
false teeth in a tree....  (PP thought about taking them home to <br/>
Stan, but we couldn't find the lowers. So he got a rock.)  <br/>
<br/>
That whole area near box #2 is like an old medical graveyard from the <br/>
early part of the 20th century.  Lots of weird little bottles such <br/>
as "Hills Nose Drops" (which I kept) and even bones (we are not sure <br/>
if they are humand or animal - no skulls though).  One of those weird <br/>
little places amongst some pretty tulgy woods.<br/>

</span></blockquote>Well, in my defense I was a little sleep deprived when Sheeba called, <br/>
as I had spent the night in a cabin full of cub scouts and snoring <br/>
dads.  Did you ever wonder what it may be like sleeping in a cave <br/>
with a bear?  Well, I do now!<br/>
<br/>
<br/>

colors was provided.   (If I recall, the South Mountain series <br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;    <br/>
<br/>
</span></blockquote>The whole "inkpads bad in winter!" thing is a bit of urban legendry <br/>
or opinion.  Most of the issues are because sloppy boxers may not <br/>
reseal the baggies well and too much liquid leaks in.  Hence, <br/>
exploded mess.  Of course, pigment pads rarely run.  I've had pads go <br/>
almost 3 yrs now without many problems, except with poor resealing.<br/>
<br/>
On an aside, I only include inpads when the stamp calls for a <br/>
specific color, so sorry tut-tutters, not every one of my boxes has <br/>
an inkpad!    ;-)<br/>

some thinking, then the effort to reach the boxes themselves.  <br/>
Excellent stamps on them.  <br/>

Oh well - figure that it's not really a Hexacat box unless you wind <br/>
up with either heat exhaustion or a cerebral hemorrhage.<br/>
