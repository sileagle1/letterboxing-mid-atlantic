of the business was in nearby Millerstown, PA. Someone used the "Who Is" look up tool:<br/>

Letterbox adventures business was discussed on a blog and Atlas Quest message boards:<br/>

The owner had grabbed my attention (around 2/2006) before her business was known to <br/>
me. She was last finder of a few letterboxes I checked in on that were not replaced well. I <br/>
wanted to touch base with her by giving her some informational links and searched for her <br/>
trail name. I found her registered on LBNA soon after with a plant of her own at Little <br/>
Buffalo State Park and in her own town.<br/>
<br/>
RGBisMe and I found her box in the state park and it was filled with a lot of advertising for <br/>
letterboxadventures.com on the pen and scented eraser stamp.  We were surprised we <br/>
hadn't heard of it and tried to check out the link when we got home. On 2/18/06 the <br/>
name was registered but the web site was not yet up. We forgot about it until other <br/>
letterboxers starting making a lot of noise about the business at the beginning of March <br/>
2006. I was mostly shocked that it was started up by someone who had done very little of <br/>
what I would consider market research.<br/>
<br/>
On 3/4/06 we went to find her second box with Maga11 &amp; Toolman Luke. Same <br/>
advertising and AC had been to the box before us. It think it was soon after this time the <br/>
owner pulled both of these boxes.<br/>
<br/>
Knowing there was a lot of controversy surrounding these boxes, we thought we would <br/>
check out the locations of a few letterboxes that were listed just on her web site.<br/>
<a href="http://trueindigo.blogspot.com/2006/04/twenty-five-mile-weekend.html" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://trueindigo.blogspot.com/2006/04/twenty-five-mile-weekend.html</a><br/>
<br/>
Although I wasn't 100% clear on my blog as to where we were, we hunted her Devil's Race <br/>
Course and 4 other nearby letterboxes. Yes, the stamp was made from a scented eraser <br/>
but was a nice little carving and the locations as well as the journey there were top notch. <br/>
There was clear advertising for the business in the 5 boxes we found that day. Lightnin' <br/>
Bug has since found some of them but the physical boxes were pulled and requirements <br/>
for the stamps are more like virtual.<br/>
<br/>
That's the info I have. My opinion? If it is a well run business and there is enough need for <br/>
it, it will thrive. I have no need for it. Personally creating what letterbox adventures sells <br/>
prepackaged is a big part what makes the hobby fun for me.<br/>

                    <div id="ygrps-yiv-1525144318">Yeah, this group showed up last year, listing links to  boxes without the owners' permission. After being BLASTED from all sides, they took the links down and went into hiding for awhile.  <br/><br/>They were basically a site selling supplies, albeit quite boring ones. Ex. fruit scented erasers for carving with their logo on them.  The market prevailed and they didn't get many takers. Bravo for them, though, for regrouping and coming up with a unique way to make a buck off of letterboxing. The guy selling workshops to educate teachers how to letterbox the Valley Quest way makes THOUSANDS. Why not this poor sap?<br/><br/>There seems to be a lot of people going the "make a buck" way recently. I have no problem with it as long as they provide a true service to letterboxing. Therefore, I don't mind paying as a premium member to Atlasquest, as I believe it provides a good service. I buy PZ Cut and carving tools from Stampeaz.com, as I believe Webfoot provides a good
 product at a great price, and her service matches none. A recent addition to Cafepress started offering t-shirts and other stuff and got in hot water because they listed designs for events...without asking the event planner.  They also were in great need of a proofreader as their site was riddled with spelling errors. Not what you want to see in a company who is printing your message on a shirt or other item....lol.  But some of the designs were cute, so maybe if they get their act together, they can make a few bucks. I probably wouldn't wear one of their shirts except to a gather, as I don't believe in SHOUTING letterboxing everywhere I go.<br/><br/>LW PhD<br/>"Nice Counts"<br/><p>
