I am the Store Manager of Barnes &amp; Noble in Richmond VA. We are a <br/>
location for the Short Pump Bibliophile Letterbook. The book was <br/>
missing and we've found it and replaced it, but I don't have <br/>
information on how to contact the person who is coordinating this. She <br/>
was in last week and it was missing so she was going to take it off the <br/>
website. Can you help notify her that it is back?<br/>
Thanks You<br/>

contacted the LBNA webmaster to contact me!  Pretty neat!<br/>
