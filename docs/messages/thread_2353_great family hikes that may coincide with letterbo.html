I've hiked with this group on many occasions - used to go somewhat
regularly, but as our kids have gotten older our schedule hasn't meshed
with the hike schedule as well :-&lt;  On at least one occasion, we've
hunted and found letterboxes along the way.  I'd strongly recommend
coming along with these folks for a casual walk with your kids,
especially if you're interested in checking out an unfamiliar park or
trail and/or are uncomfortable walking in the woods with your kids by
yourself.  The parents tend to keep a general eye out for roving
munchkins (haven't lost any yet! :-&gt; ), and we've always had a good
time.<br/>
<br/>
You bring your kids (ANY age that you're comfortable supervising - yes,
there are babies in backpacks and front packs; there are also teens),
snacks/drinks for them &amp; yourself, any sunscreen/hats/etc. that
you'd normally bring on a hike, and usually lunches for yourselves for
the end of the hike (lunch is optional but is often at a playground). 
I strongly recommend towels for the car and changes of clothing,
including shoes - there tend to be tempting mud puddles and streams on
many of these hikes.  Yes, I believe you must bring kid(s) - these are
hikes specifically organized for families with youngsters.  I also
recommend a camera - to film the kids' antics and/or the scenery.  It's
a very friendly group.  Many of them are big on veggies and down on
junk food, in case you weren't sure what to bring for snacks. 
Homeschoolers, public schoolers, and private schoolers are all welcome
- there are all sorts in the group.<br/>
<br/>
The bluebell hike (this year's is Saturday April 14th) is especially
memorable.  Long wooden stomping bridges across the boggy soil;
thousands if not millions of bluebells scattered through the shady
woods; huge sandy (sunny!) playground to enjoy afterward at lunchtime.<br/>
<br/>
Here's the upcoming schedule as Lauren sent it to me, minus the hike
leaders' phone numbers for privacy since this is such a big mailing
list.<br/>
