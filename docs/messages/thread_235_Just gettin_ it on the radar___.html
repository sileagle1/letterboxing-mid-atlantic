Down the road apiece, maybe late fall, I was thinking of doing a series and planting it in Tyler State Park in Newtown, PA. Tyler is HUGE and to the best of my knowledge there are only 2 boxes there, or rumored to be there, I think planted by Mukluk. I hunted but found neither...but again, that's me! Anyway, I was thinking it might be something we wanted to do as a group? Like the stuff CT is always doing. I love music, everyone in my family are musicians, except me but hey, someone's gotto be in the audience right? We can't all be on stage.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Anyway here's my idea for whomever is interested. I'm looking at getting it together maybe in Novemeber, or maybe it could be an over winter project to plant in the spring, who knows. It's called "the Battle of the Bands" and will feature stamps donated by folks of thier favortie bands. You can plant them your self, heck we can have a group planting day, or send them to me and I will plant it for you, then email you the clues so you can post your own box. H&amp;H will of course be planting the Grateful Dead, we also already have a Led Zeppelin stamp and are working on String Cheese Incident and possibly Radiohead. I know letterboxingbee had mentioned doing a Pink Floyd stamp so she might want to include that in this. </div>
<div> </div>
<div>Anyway, just the nucleus of an idea for our area. Put it on the radar if your interested and we look at it again in a couple of months.</div>

He is pretty old and it was hot and humid, especially the humidity, on Saturday. I water the heck out of him but I guess I shouldn't have had him out so long.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>An interesting thing though. His vet called to check on him the next night (which was very nice of her) and she was again asking if I couldn't leave him home more. I explained that he was my trail buddy and I really didn't feel safe on the trail without him. She asked why I had to hike so much and I mentioned I am involved in this really neat hobby...well she wound up getting the website address from me, was already talking about using her veterinarian stamp that she has at the office and hitting the trails with her two golden retreivers! LOL! Another addict! When Dude and I go back next week we'll have to find out how she made out. </div>
<div> </div>
<div>Oh, by thw way, if you can buy or have made a rubber stamp of your favorite band you can certainly plant a box. If not, you'll have some pretty cool boxes to hunt. Take care,</div>

Also, Turtle McQ did a couple of hitchhikers that travel along with <br/>
mini-CDs that she burned using her PC. Each mini-CD features a song by one <br/>
of her (and my) favorite folk performers, Kris Delmhorst. The idea is that <br/>
people take the hitchhiker home with them and then listen to the CD before <br/>
returning the hitchhiker to the next box. She got permission from Kris to <br/>
do it, and some people have even reported that they've bought CDs as a <br/>
result of hearing the song on the mini-CDs, which is nice. Anyway, it's <br/>
just another little idea to get the creative juices flowing!<br/>

still together! (Yep, I heard of them, I think I like them better <br/>
then the orginal......oh, that may get me in trouble....)<br/>
oh and one more thing.....<br/>
OINGO BOINGO! OINGO BOINGO! OINGO BOINGO!<br/>
The Woodwooses call OINGO BOINGO! And maybe X! But we will see. <br/>
What? ya don't know who OINGO BOINGO is? Well, do ya know who Danny <br/>
Elfman is?...that's right, the musical genius behind "Nightmare <br/>
before Xmas", and composer of all the "Batman" movies, "Simpson" <br/>
theme, "Men in Black", etc. Well, his wonderful band in the 80s was...<br/>
OINGO BOINGO! "It's a Deadman's party, who could ask for more, just <br/>
come and leave your body and soul at the door.." <br/>
And just in case ya were wondering who X is..one of the best Punk <br/>
bands of the 80s, and the lead singer, Xcene Cervanka is the X-wife <br/>
and mother of his son, of Viggo Mortenson, Aragorn from LOTR. <br/>
So as far as these series go, I can't come and plant it, but would <br/>
willing carve the stamp, and put the box together, pack it all up and <br/>
mail it to HH. Is that how these things are done?<br/>

&gt; Were a real group?!? ARE a real group! As far as I know they are <br/>

&gt; then the orginal......oh, that may get me in trouble....)<br/>
&gt; oh and one more thing.....<br/>
&gt; OINGO BOINGO! OINGO BOINGO! OINGO BOINGO!<br/>
&gt; The Woodwooses call OINGO BOINGO! And maybe X! But we will see. <br/>
&gt; What? ya don't know who OINGO BOINGO is? Well, do ya know who Danny <br/>
&gt; Elfman is?...that's right, the musical genius behind "Nightmare <br/>
&gt; before Xmas", and composer of all the "Batman" movies, "Simpson" <br/>
&gt; theme, "Men in Black", etc. Well, his wonderful band in the 80s <br/>
was...<br/>
&gt; OINGO BOINGO! "It's a Deadman's party, who could ask for more, just <br/>
&gt; come and leave your body and soul at the door.." <br/>
&gt; And just in case ya were wondering who X is..one of the best Punk <br/>
&gt; bands of the 80s, and the lead singer, Xcene Cervanka is the X-wife <br/>
&gt; and mother of his son, of Viggo Mortenson, Aragorn from LOTR. <br/>
&gt; So as far as these series go, I can't come and plant it, but would <br/>
&gt; willing carve the stamp, and put the box together, pack it all up <br/>
and <br/>
&gt; mail it to HH. Is that how these things are done?<br/>

Are you going to be able to track who picked which band(s)?<br/>
Maybe ***FdL*** can put DATABASE capability on this group so we can <br/>
set up a means of folks showing what they picked.  I know HnH won't <br/>
have a "monstermash" type website available - although how cool would <br/>
that be with audio clips! <br/>
<br/>
Anyway, you know how musically challenged I am - so I have to take <br/>
the easy way out with the Beatles.  Do we have to pick a song <br/>
too?  "Here There and Everywhere" or "Long and Winding Road"<br/>
<br/>
That mini-cd idea was neat -- do they play on regular portable cd <br/>
players?  Maybe the Series could inform folks to bring theirs on the <br/>
trail.<br/>

The problem with listening to a CD at a letterbox is that it draws even <br/>
more attention to you, and I doubt most letterboxers would hang around long <br/>
enough to listen, anyway, particularly if there are lots of boxes in the <br/>
series yet to find.<br/>

northern Delaware (and one in PA). All were in good shape, the clues for <br/>
all of them were clear enough not to give us any real trouble, and none <br/>
were MIA, which is a pretty good track record!<br/>
<br/>
Here's what we found:<br/>
<br/>
Just Passin' Thru<br/>
Yummmmy<br/>
Sum It Up<br/>
Brandywine Springs (2)<br/>
Brandywine Bluebird<br/>
Future Discovery Road Runner<br/>
Carousel Park Animals (3)<br/>
Dance of Joy<br/>
Wolfbox<br/>
What a Long Strange Trip It's Been (3) (awesome carving from Carvin' Carmen!)<br/>
<br/>
Jennifer also passed F200 at the end of the day when logging in to the <br/>
Grateful Dead boxes, which only added to our fun for the day!<br/>
<br/>
We left the Honor Liberty hitchhiker in Yummmmy, so if anyone would like to <br/>
grab this one, it's an easy find. (Don &amp; Gwen want Honor Liberty to move to <br/>
as many places and letterboxers around the country as possible, which is <br/>
why you're supposed to post the location on the list -- I'll be sending it <br/>
to the big list shortly, too.)<br/>
<br/>
Finally, we also found Ode to a Good Joe in Concordville, PA to wrap up our <br/>
day.<br/>
<br/>
Whew!<br/>

caught in traffic heading through Philly, so we didn't arrive at the <br/>
parking lot of the first box until 11 am. We wrapped up the last one <br/>
between 7:30 and 8:00 pm, so we were eating ice cream by the time the sun <br/>
was setting.<br/>
<br/>
I was interested, so I just checked, and my personal record for most <br/>
letterboxes in a day is 17 (not counting hitchhikers, event stamps, <br/>
exchanges, etc.) -- I've done it twice, once in CA and once in OH. I can't <br/>
wait to get to CT someday and really find some letterboxes!<br/>

That day should be Oct 2 for the Mansfield Monster Mash, 126 boxes <br/>

may have to stand in line to stamp in at a few boxes %^)<br/>

I think it's site report? That's what I've been telling myself, <br/>
anyway :)<br/>

On another note, I'm wishing Carmen a full and speedy recovery :)<br/>

responses.  I'd say there's about a 75% likelihood that I'll be heading up 
to the First State either Friday night or Saturday morning, and probably spend 
the entire weekend absorbed with boxing.  Since Congress is in recess 
(which means I've got nothing to do either), I'll probably spend a chunk of my 
day plotting out a map of where to go so I can hit as many as I possibly 
can.  I'll make it a point to visit Gordon's Pond for your HH, if Poison 
Ivy doesn't beat me to it!</font></span></div>
