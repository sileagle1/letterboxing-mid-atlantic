&gt;           I feel dumb. Yes, I originally planted the<br/>
&gt; box. It went missing a while <br/>
&gt; ago, so a girl scout group offered to carve and<br/>
&gt; replace the box. On a <br/>
&gt; mild day in December, I checked on the box for the<br/>
&gt; 1st time since it <br/>
&gt; had been replaced, and forgot that I stamped my log.<br/>
&gt; Since it was my <br/>
&gt; box, I didn't enter it as a find on LB.org or AQ.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Thanks for clearing up my confusion.<br/>

&gt; &gt; Isn't that your letterbox, HSC Pride? I think we<br/>
&gt; found it back when <br/>
&gt; it had the original stamp. It was falsely reported<br/>
&gt; as missing at one <br/>
&gt; point but was in there -- you just had to do some<br/>
&gt; poking around inside <br/>
&gt; the cavity.<br/>
