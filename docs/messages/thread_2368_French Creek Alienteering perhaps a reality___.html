Panther and perhaps the McCleln Clan (hope I spelled it right), I <br/>
think we can pull off the French Creek Alienteering event.<br/>
<br/>
Right now, the date that is least conflicted with other mid-Atlantic <br/>
events is 17 June 2007.  No conflict with NJ, VA of MD events.  This <br/>
will also give those who may wish to head up to NY some time to make <br/>
it back if they feel it worth their while...<br/>
<br/>
PP and H&amp;H are looking into meeting places, etc.<br/>
<br/>
I hope to plant the boxes on Memorial Day weekend, thereabouts.  So, <br/>
if you'd like to see one of your "Alien Themed" letterboxes become <br/>
part of this fun course/event, please let me know (via email).  It <br/>
can be amusing aliens (like from the Far Side cartoon), scary aliens, <br/>
whatever floats your alien's boat.  My only request is that I receive <br/>
them prior to 24 May 2007 so that I can plant them that weekend.<br/>
<br/>
We will eventually get this up on AQ; I shall post this when the time <br/>
comes.<br/>
<br/>
Stay tuned as things maybe develops.  Remember to reach me offline if <br/>
you wish to contribute your view of what Alienteering is all about.<br/>
