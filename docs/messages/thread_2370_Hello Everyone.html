introduce myself (and hubby). We are new to letterboxing only having <br/>
discovered this in the last few weeks and found our first box placed <br/>
by Woodthrush, Bay bridge/Sandy Point box 3/25 and our second box <br/>
today along with two attempts. Seems boxes were missing. I know we <br/>
were in the correct area and should I had done some more research <br/>
seems both have been attempted before me. But a beautiful day spent <br/>
outside and having fun nonetheless. I have been reading all I can <br/>
soak up about letterboxing and have gather some really good <br/>
information so far. I am looking forward to carving a stamp and <br/>
placing my own box, hopefully this summer, and attending a gathering <br/>
so we can meet some people and find out even more about boxing in <br/>
general. Hoping we can go out again tommorrow and find a box that <br/>
illuded us today (we just did not have right directions to area)and <br/>
enjoy another day outside.  <br/>
We have just moved to Annapolis from Delaware (there for 6 months)and <br/>
up from South Carolina before that. I sure wish we had known about <br/>
this before relocating from Delaware, there are lots of boxes in the <br/>
area where we were (Bear area) and we did not even know it. But the <br/>
good thing is we can revisit the area and play catch up as it were. <br/>
Hope to meet some of you in the future and sorry for posting such a <br/>
long message (hope I am forgiven) <br/>
