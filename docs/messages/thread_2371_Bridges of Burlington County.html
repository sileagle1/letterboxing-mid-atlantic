<div><font face="Arial" size="2">I got a report that all of the boxes are present 
and accounted for - Yeah!</font></div>
<div><font face="Arial" size="2">Unfortunately, box # 2 is reported wet. If you are 
planning on going for these boxes, please bring paper to leave your stamp 
impression. With Spring upon us, my work schedule is keeping me pretty busy here 
in RI and Dave is very busy at Dix and doesn't get too many days off right now - 
so box maintenance is not going to be possible for the next few weeks, 
sorry,</font></div>
<div><font face="Arial" size="2">If the logbook needs replacing, and you're willing 
to replace it and dry out the old one. Perhaps we can work something out 
for retrieval.</font></div>
<div><font face="Arial" size="2">By the way, Dave is planning on leaving the area in 
November and we would love for someone to adopt these boxes and the Ong's Hat 
(psuedo)HHH.</font></div>
