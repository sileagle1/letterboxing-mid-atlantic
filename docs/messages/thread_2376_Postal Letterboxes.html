workshop on letterboxing for the Appalachian Mountain Club at their <br/>
Mohican Center near the Delaware Water Gap. There will be classes on <br/>
coptic stitch bookbinding, needle tool carving, planting, hiding, <br/>
mystery clueification, and two hikes of 5 miles or so, including <br/>
finding some of the existing boxes in the Water Gap area and others. <br/>
We're aiming to jam the weekend full of surprises and fun for both <br/>
new and experienced boxers. As you may know, Clueless has been a <br/>
long-standing volunteer and hike leader for the AMC, and this is part <br/>
of an effort that they're making to increase usage of their Mohican <br/>
Center, so it's a worthy cause. The registration fee includes lodging <br/>
in the center's oh-so-luxurious bunk beds along with any stinky <br/>
Appalachian Trail thru-hikers who might still be making their way <br/>
north at that point (and I suppose you could camp in your own tent, <br/>
too) and breakfasts and Saturday night dinner and the traditional <br/>
Mohican raucous after-dinner/late-night musical singalong <br/>
folk-till-you-drop entertainment.<br/>

We'll have more details later if anyone is interested....<br/>

</span></blockquote>I think I got this letterboxing thing down pretty good now, or am at <br/>
least getting there, so I don't need classes, but do you need any help.  <br/>
I am sure some of us could at least show up one of the days and the <br/>
folks at the camp can have a chance to get some exchanges and see some <br/>
different stamps and ideas that are out there.<br/>
<br/>
Ahhhh, young fertile minds ready to be molded... BWAHAHAHAHA!!!<br/>

or on Saturday morning early is probably fine. Then again, we might <br/>
try to whip up some mischief for late night Friday.... &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
There won't be a problem with the pace of the hikes -- we'll take <br/>
them as slow as they need to be or have alternative plans that are <br/>
less strenuous, depending on the eventual size and pace of the group. <br/>
But then again, maybe you should think of it as the start of your <br/>
training regimen for the UK (those tors are higher than they look!)....<br/>

I was thinking it might be fun to do an on-trail <br/>
workshop, so we might take a break and sit down <br/>
in the shade for a spell in the midst of a hike. <br/>
Don't worry, even if the hikes are uphill both <br/>
coming and going, we promise that everyone will finish one way or another!<br/>

&gt; 3-5, Clueless &amp; I are teaching a weekend-long <br/>

their <br/>
&gt; &gt; Mohican Center near the Delaware Water Gap. There will be classes <br/>
on <br/>
&gt; &gt; coptic stitch bookbinding, needle tool carving, planting, hiding, <br/>
&gt; &gt; mystery clueification, and two hikes of 5 miles or so, including <br/>
&gt; &gt; finding some of the existing boxes in the Water Gap area and <br/>
others. <br/>
&gt; &gt; We're aiming to jam the weekend full of surprises and fun for <br/>
both <br/>
&gt; &gt; new and experienced boxers. As you may know, Clueless has been a <br/>
&gt; &gt; long-standing volunteer and hike leader for the AMC, and this is <br/>
part <br/>
&gt; &gt; of an effort that they're making to increase usage of their <br/>
Mohican <br/>
&gt; &gt; Center, so it's a worthy cause. The registration fee includes <br/>
lodging <br/>
&gt; &gt; in the center's oh-so-luxurious bunk beds along with any stinky <br/>
&gt; &gt; Appalachian Trail thru-hikers who might still be making their way <br/>

&gt; &gt; folk-till-you-drop entertainment.<br/>
