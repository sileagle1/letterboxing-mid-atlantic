<br/>
Tom and I were able to finish Who's that Author in Doylestown and <br/>
found most things in good shape.  Be careful thought, there is a <br/>
yellow jack den right near the first box.  My right arm bears the <br/>
welt of my encounter with the 'blood and crips' of the insect world.  <br/>
Tom was OK.  After that the DEET came out and on!<br/>
<br/>
Box #5's hiding spot is beginning to disintegrate badly making re-<br/>
hiding difficult - I'll drop the placer a note.<br/>
<br/>
Fun little series - Very HIGH density - must be what Connecticut is <br/>
like!  ;-)<br/>
<br/>
We'd have done a few at Mercer House, but Tom was hungry and it was <br/>
getting warm for his tastes.<br/>
