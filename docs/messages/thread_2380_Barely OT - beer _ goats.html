Anyway, if you got into the canned beer that Syner and I brought to the <br/>
Delaware Games then you tasted Sly Fox's stuff.  The brewery has its <br/>
annual May Fest set for Sunday, 5/6 from 11 to 5 at the Phoenixville <br/>
location.<br/>
<br/>
From what I understand, the highlight is the goat race, the winner of <br/>
which is the eponym for the annual Mai Bock.  There is a ceremonial keg <br/>
tapping at some point.</div>

good one.<br/>
<br/>
Leinekugel's Red is kinda like the Yuengling Lager of Wisconsin, but <br/>
actually a better beer, IMO.  I bought a whole case of the stuff when I <br/>
was out there last August, never made it home with it though :-)<br/>
<br/>
Since Circle started carrying the Sunset Wheat, I am hopeful they get <br/>
the Red.  I even requested it, so maybe.<br/>
<br/>
Tonight, if I have the time, I am going to check out a place I passed in <br/>
Harrisburg that advertises a selection of 800 on their board, so maybe I <br/>
will have some luck (and maybe they will have some Tröeg's Mad Elf left too)<br/>
