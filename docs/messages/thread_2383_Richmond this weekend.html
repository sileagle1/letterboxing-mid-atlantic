The Clue series is a lot of fun! An interesting variety of carving
styles and mediums. We finished them this winter. Lots and lots of
walking around in circles on a couple of them, though...<br/>

You like The Griz best only because you've never ridden the Phoenix at <br/>
Knoebels (I hear there is a yearly gathering there).  But Griz is by  <br/>
far the best coaster in that park.  A few years ago when I was there <br/>
with Lady Lorain (another sister who letterboxes, they seem endless, <br/>
huh?), I would not introduce her to The Griz until nightfall, when it is <br/>
running hot.  What a wonderful, mean ride we had, with the dark, <br/>
startling tunnel.  She was shocked, and then wanted to ride again, of <br/>
course.<br/>
<br/>
But, if you can come out on Saturday I'll show you why the Flying Eagles <br/>
can be the scariest ride you have ever been on ;-)<br/>

summers ago when he was 4 &amp; he loved it (he's really tall for his <br/>
age).  On our annual family outing last summer, he rode it twice before <br/>
trying the twister too.  With these as his first/familiar roller <br/>
coasters, will he be forever disappointed?  <br/>
<br/>
Interestingly, we went to Disney World in January of 2006, and Peter <br/>
commented on how Knoebel's rides didn't have such long lines (and that <br/>
was during Disney's slow season).  (Another disappointment for him was <br/>
not being quite tall enough for the Rock &amp; Roll coaster - I think he <br/>
needed another inch at the time.)  Of course, he &amp; his little brother <br/>
Gabe loved everything else Disney, but I was gratified to feel that our <br/>
future trips to Knoebels wouldn't be belittled.  <br/>
