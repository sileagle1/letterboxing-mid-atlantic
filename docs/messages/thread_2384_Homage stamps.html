homage. This was done anonymously so no one knew had<br/>
the homage. It was pretty funny the first time on the<br/>
trail and I found Silent Duck stamped in the log, I<br/>
almost fell off my camp stool. Now if you can figure<br/>
out who has the stamp it can be exchanged. When I<br/>
carve an homge now I will pass it on so the "homaged"<br/>
can't figure out who did it.<br/>
Miz Scarlet, aka Miz Harlot, Miz Starlet<br/>

&gt; The original idea was to sign in a box's log with the<br/>
&gt; homage. This was done anonymously so no one knew had<br/>
&gt; the homage. It was pretty funny the first time on the<br/>
&gt; trail and I found Silent Duck stamped in the log, I<br/>
&gt; almost fell off my camp stool. Now if you can figure<br/>
&gt; out who has the stamp it can be exchanged. When I<br/>
&gt; carve an homge now I will pass it on so the "homaged"<br/>
&gt; can't figure out who did it.<br/>
&gt; Miz Scarlet, aka Miz Harlot, Miz Starlet<br/>
&gt;  Ok so who has Miz Harlot? I just gotta have it for my<br/>
&gt; log book!<br/>

&gt; &gt; At our recent West Coast gathering I  introduced the<br/>
&gt; &gt; concept of Homage Stamps and they <br/>
&gt; &gt; were quite a hit.  Only problem was I wasn't sure<br/>
&gt; &gt; quite how to use them.  I started out by <br/>
&gt; &gt; putting them in boxes where I thought the Object of<br/>
&gt; &gt; the Homage would see them.  Then I <br/>
&gt; &gt; snuck some in to people's log books.  But neither of<br/>
&gt; &gt; those methods were useful in getting <br/>
&gt; &gt; them noticed by everyone who was an Object.  So, how<br/>
&gt; &gt; do you folks do this?  And do you <br/>
&gt; &gt; have them registered anywhere on Atlas Quest?  I<br/>
&gt; &gt; think there will be more West Coast <br/>
&gt; &gt; homages soon....<br/>
