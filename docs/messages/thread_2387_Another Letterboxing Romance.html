has popped the question to ever so cute Kitten Without Mittens.<br/>
<br/>
The Kitten recounts:<br/>
<br/>
"ok ok ok ill tell....after i kill wandering star.<br/>
<br/>
no im not pregnant<br/>
no we didnt adopt<br/>
yes it involved letterboxing<br/>
no not a rock<br/>
yes you have to thank all the wonderful family of postal letterboxing<br/>
<br/>
in january the Valentines Day Magic Ring was listed, and me suddenly <br/>
feeling very much sappy, both myself and celtic quinn to carve a stamp <br/>
together for it- instead we carved to seperate ones- but the downfall of <br/>
that was that they were a complete secret from one another. We didnt <br/>
speak of it, we ignored each others logbooks, and it was very hard.<br/>
after a month of this plotting the ring finally began and our boxes went <br/>
out- mine in one package and cq's in another.<br/>
fast forward to today.<br/>
we finally recieved them home, after the four other lovely participants <br/>
recieving our packages- and gracefully not telling either of us what <br/>
they thought of them, we fianlly got to open them.<br/>
wandering star being on-site took pictures (she also tomented me all day <br/>
saying that i know what it is and you cant have it...but anyways)<br/>
so cq loved my postcard letter that i had written a loving sentiment on <br/>
and included a stamped image of myself, and when i finally got to open <br/>
his three box package with two cameras staring me in the face (see im <br/>
building up tension here)...(DUH DUN DUUUMMM) so the first had a lovely <br/>
poem that he wrote for me and a matching sentimental stamp, the second <br/>
lines from a love song, and the third..well...<br/>
<br/>
ok ill tell- it was a stamp that had a ring and around it "will you <br/>
marry me" and attached to the stamp holder was a ring box with ring inside.<br/>
<br/>
so everyone in that ring knew- ALL my friends knew- even my friends <br/>
mothers knew- and i JUST found out my mother knew!!!<br/>
<br/>
and i said yes."<br/>
<br/>
Awwwww... ain't it sweet.<br/>
<br/>
Let me be the first from LBMA to congratulate the two of you.<br/>
<br/>
I don't know if they are in the group or not, so I'll use telepathy if not.<br/>
