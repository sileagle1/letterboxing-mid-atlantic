It should be easy; I'd been there before, and the directions didn't <br/>
look too hard, right?  The day started out overcast, and it actually <br/>
snowed a little, but then the sun came out.  Beth got home from work <br/>
around 11, and we got to Eagle Rock around 12:15.  Beth decided to <br/>
stay in the car-- she wasn't feeling well-- so I set out on my own.  <br/>
Well, I found the yellow trail to follow into the woods easily <br/>
enough, and I thought I was doing pretty good.  The ground was very <br/>
muddy, and there were many pools of standing water both on the trail <br/>
and off.  Several times the path was flooded and I had to track <br/>
around until there was another dry stretch.  I had to be careful not <br/>
to slip when I was going down the hill.  I think where I went wrong <br/>
might have been where the clues mention "a tree in the middle of the <br/>
trail ending a bed of rock."  I don't recall seeing that (-- or <br/>
looking for it-- for that matter.  Pay more attention to the clues <br/>
next time!).  Anyway, I got to what I thought was the bottom of the <br/>
hill at the end of the rocky trail, and I looked around for <br/>
the "large tree directly on the left", but there were a lot of large <br/>
trees, and it would've been easy to miss a "large rock" under all of <br/>
the leftover leaves.  Someone had built a rough shelter out of limbs <br/>
against a tree.  There were a few bridges over small creeks, too.  I <br/>
went back up and down a few times, before it was clear I either got <br/>
something wrong, or the clues were too vague.  I'll give it another <br/>
try when the weather is warmer, and the ground is drier.  Maybe I'll <br/>
try contacting the placer to ask if I made a wrong turn, but I think <br/>
I'll give it one more try before I give up and cry "uncle."<br/>

&gt; It should be easy; I'd been there before, and the<br/>
&gt; directions didn't <br/>
&gt; look too hard, right? The day started out overcast,<br/>
&gt; and it actually <br/>

&gt; Beth decided to <br/>

&gt; out on my own. <br/>
&gt; Well, I found the yellow trail to follow into the<br/>
&gt; woods easily <br/>
&gt; enough, and I thought I was doing pretty good. The<br/>
&gt; ground was very <br/>
&gt; muddy, and there were many pools of standing water<br/>
&gt; both on the trail <br/>
&gt; and off. Several times the path was flooded and I<br/>
&gt; had to track <br/>
&gt; around until there was another dry stretch. I had to<br/>
&gt; be careful not <br/>
&gt; to slip when I was going down the hill. I think<br/>
&gt; where I went wrong <br/>
&gt; might have been where the clues mention "a tree in<br/>
&gt; the middle of the <br/>
&gt; trail ending a bed of rock." I don't recall seeing<br/>
&gt; that (-- or <br/>
&gt; looking for it-- for that matter. Pay more attention<br/>
&gt; to the clues <br/>
&gt; next time!). Anyway, I got to what I thought was the<br/>

&gt; around for <br/>

We found Gabriella's Flag but it was not without venturing down a wrong turn first. We had <br/>
explored the trails in the park before and felt comfortable coming back but missed a turn <br/>
anyway. It is also possible that the box is gone as it was close to the trail and had potential <br/>
to be seen by others. Contacting the place might be a good idea.<br/>

close to the statue you might trip over it.  Plus it has lat and long <br/>
coords in the clue, so at least I'll know that I'm near the right <br/>
location...  I had assumed that the clue began with Gabby's Flag (the <br/>
box, not the statue,) which was why I went for that one first.<br/>

&gt; We found Gabriella's Flag but it was not without venturing down a <br/>
wrong turn first. We had <br/>
&gt; explored the trails in the park before and felt comfortable coming <br/>
back but missed a turn <br/>
&gt; anyway. It is also possible that the box is gone as it was close to <br/>
the trail and had potential <br/>
&gt; to be seen by others. Contacting the place might be a good idea.<br/>

                    <div id="ygrps-yiv-42185946">Hey, Pakrat, nice trip report. I found both boxes last May. Of the <br/>
two, "We Will Never Forget" is the more likely to get lost, as it is <br/>
very near the monument. <br/>
<br/>
Gabriella's Flag is actually not difficult to find, except keep in <br/>
mind that I made two previous fruitless attempts, wrote to Hillel <br/>
three times about this box, and he changed the clues to clarify. <br/>
<br/>
Still didn't work for me, even after he updated the clues. The <br/>
difficulty lies in 1) the trail markers don't inspire confidence as <br/>
the blue trail seems to meander all through the park, and 2) the <br/>
whole fricken area is a "bed of rock." <br/>
<br/>
Then, the third time, I found it easily. I think it has something to <br/>
do with letterboxing / hiking experience. <br/>
<br/>
So it is a great first letterbox to seek if you want a learning <br/>
experience... but Liz's boxes in Essex County are fairly easy, try <br/>
those first. She has at least three terrific ones in Verona and West <br/>
Orange.<br/>
<br/>
With enough experience, eventually you can work your way up to a TGD <br/>
box in Essex County.<br/>
