longer boxes and many of their boxes have been lost in the sands of time...<br/>
<br/>
But back to Squirrel. I've now been in contact with several LBMAers offline, and it appears <br/>
Squirrel no longer boxes. I will give her some time to reply to my email and if I don't hear <br/>
from her I will figure out something nice to do with this fine box.<br/>

Thanks to everyone, online and off, for their help!<br/>
