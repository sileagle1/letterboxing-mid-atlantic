This box saw about the double the traffic that folks reported on LB &amp; <br/>
AQ, think that it drew a lot of families and new boxers because of <br/>
the short walk and the community park in which it was located.  I did <br/>
the check based on a report from a new boxer who couldn't find it.<br/>
<br/>
When park staff take a box, well, sometimes that's regs and sometimes <br/>
that's a misunderstanding but either way, it's a work duty and every <br/>
job comes with distasteful stuff.  For another park user to take it, <br/>
just to be mean, sux.<br/>
<br/>
On the other hand, it was my first carve and I can do a little better <br/>
now, and hey there was a tree hollow a bit further down the trail...<br/>

</span></blockquote>I was probably the last reported finder on that box (I could go look to <br/>
be sure).<br/>
<br/>
When I found it there was about 2 inches of ice on it.  I really had to <br/>
dig to get it out, but I think I rehid it pretty well, though there was <br/>
a giant hole in the ice and snow by the tree which could have given it <br/>
away.  I am sorry if it did, I would not have expected anyone else to go <br/>
down that trail in that whether.<br/>
<br/>
The sign was intact at the time of the find.<br/>
<br/>
When you rehide, look for a spot further from the trail, and face the <br/>
box away from the trail.  Hiding boxes is a constant learning <br/>
experiance, I know I am still coming up with ways to better hide them.<br/>

Don't worry about it, Cyclonic - not much that you can do about <br/>
broken ice and I know that you would hide it thoroughly.<br/>
<br/>
Even if someone else left it in plain view, I know that a fuggle <br/>
messed with the sign, spent some time back there for malicious <br/>
reasons.  I looked through the woods on both sides of the trail going <br/>
back to the volleyball courts and couldn't find the sign or the box, <br/>
so this person had time to mess around - nothing would keep a person <br/>
out of there at night.<br/>
<br/>
Yup, yup, stuff always to learn.  Will do it better next time.<br/>

&gt; &gt; Unfortunately, I have wondered if a new boxer made Shroom <br/>
conspicuous <br/>
&gt; &gt; with a rehide that was either too little or too much.  The last <br/>
&gt; &gt; reported find was by a good and experienced boxer but that was a <br/>
few <br/>
&gt; &gt; weeks before the "can't find it" email.  It's not as though we <br/>
can <br/>
&gt; &gt; check any of our boxes on even a weekly basis.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; It was a good site, so look for "Shroom with a 2" at some point - <br/>
&gt; &gt; smaller box, better clues, better hide, better stamp.<br/>
&gt; &gt;   <br/>
&gt; I was probably the last reported finder on that box (I could go <br/>
look to <br/>
&gt; be sure).<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; When I found it there was about 2 inches of ice on it.  I really <br/>
had to <br/>
&gt; dig to get it out, but I think I rehid it pretty well, though there <br/>
was <br/>
&gt; a giant hole in the ice and snow by the tree which could have given <br/>
it <br/>
&gt; away.  I am sorry if it did, I would not have expected anyone else <br/>
to go <br/>
&gt; down that trail in that whether.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; The sign was intact at the time of the find.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; When you rehide, look for a spot further from the trail, and face <br/>
the <br/>
&gt; box away from the trail.  Hiding boxes is a constant learning <br/>
&gt; experiance, I know I am still coming up with ways to better hide <br/>
them.<br/>
