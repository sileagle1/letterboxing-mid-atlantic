confirmed, by bending down.....looking and feeling where it should be.  <br/>
All that was there was the Velco, and the box was gone.  Oddly, today I <br/>
got a report that the box was fine, and was infact there.  Very <br/>
Interesting! ..with this being about a ghost.<br/>
<br/>
I am headed to Old Town Alexandria, VA this weekend to check on the <br/>
box, and more importantly do yet another planning trip for the June <br/>
23rd Pub Crawl.  If anyone is interested in meeting up for some <br/>
practice beers, while Im there email me of the board for my cell <br/>
number, or to plan that out.</div>
