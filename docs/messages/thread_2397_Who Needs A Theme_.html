meaning to sign up, so get to it.  An bunch of new folks have already <br/>
signed up, and I am looking forward to meeting you.  I know there are a <br/>
bunch of you folks over in Joisey, so come on out and join in the fun!<br/>
<br/>
I have gotten several wonderful box contributions that will be planted <br/>
this weekend.  This is on top of the 15 boxes that were planted last <br/>
week, with still more on the way.<br/>
<br/>
It looks like there will be a whole bunch of event boxes to keep you <br/>
busy as well.<br/>
<br/>
If you would like to camp, that is no problem.  All you have to do is <br/>
show up with your camping gear and a contribution of just $1.00.  No <br/>
reservations are needed.  The site is large and within walking distance <br/>
of the gathering.<br/>
<br/>
For campers or those that just wish to have some fun after dark, there <br/>
will be a night boxing series that will be easy and about 10 boxes, some <br/>
new, and some old, but all fun.<br/>
<br/>
The gathering should be a blast!  Bring a friend.  Bring two friends.  <br/>
Heck, bring a whole gaggle of friends!<br/>

Remember, Washington Crossing State Park in New Jersey, May 19 at the <br/>
Nature Center Pavilion.<br/>

weekend I have to work and we can't.  You guys have an uncanny knack<br/>
of choosing the only weekend I work per month to have gatherings!  <br/>
<br/>
By the way, any word about a date for the Knoebels trip?  I have been<br/>
watching AQ for it and it still isn't posted.  The kids would love<br/>
this one.  I have a budding roller coaster lover in my family, much to<br/>
my surprise.<br/>
