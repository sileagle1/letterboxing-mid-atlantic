<br/>
I have long admired Fleur de Lis' wonderful letterboxing site. <br/>
Inspired by her, I decided to create my own site to chronicle my <br/>
thoughts and experiences in letterboxing, and whatever else is going <br/>
through my mind!<br/>
<br/>
Since Eric and I are expecting our second child in December, I <br/>
thought it would be fun to include an "awaiting baby" link to <br/>
chronicle those thoughts separately. Maybe family members tuning to <br/>
see baby news will get hooked on letterboxing, too!<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, the door's open, come on over and pay a visit!<br/>

Irene, that sounds pretty neat about cavers getting babies into caves <br/>
early on. Since it will be December - we'll have to find a drive-by!<br/>
