I am not from either, although I have met many of you at the Philly <br/>
Leap Day Gather. :) So here is a shout from south of the Mason Dixon <br/>
Line. <br/>
If any of you ever head down this way, I am always looking for boxers <br/>
to go with. Since the other Formidable Donuts seem to have lost <br/>
interest/time. There are plenty in this area I have yet to find. I am <br/>
not a fan of going out on my own. <br/>
As for the proposed gather... I do not know if that one is possible <br/>
for me to make. A bit of a haul right now. But who knows what I will <br/>
be doing late May or Early June.<br/>
<br/>
Happy hunting! <br/>

<div> </div>
<div>We are thinking of making a run past your neck of the woods Easter weekend and hiking/hunting/planting on Seneca Rocks in WV. I had mentioned that to you at the gathering and you said you weren't sure if the box was still there. But we are going to plant one in memory of my Mom on the summit and see if we can find the other. I also plan to camp in the Fredericksburg, MD or Newmarket VA area in May so hopefully on one of these trips we can get together!</div>
