                    <div id="ygrps-yiv-1200910929">Well, I had a big LBMA 'boxing weekend, and I am practically giddy<br/>
with joy.<br/>
<br/>
While The Silent One was at a conference, I got out in the awesome<br/>
weather and did some boxing with my buddy Skip.  More importantly, I<br/>
did some planting &amp; maintenance.<br/>
<br/>
First: replanted the MIA Ghost of Graeme (stamp by Doug).  Afterwards,<br/>
I realized that all the other boxes that had been are no more.  Anyone<br/>
know what happened here?  I had permission on my box and was never<br/>
told otherwise, but suddenly felt a bit suspicious afterwards.<br/>
<br/>
Next: on to...well, I can't tell you (it being a mystery, or should I<br/>
say "mystery", since it won't be tough to solve), but I FINALLY<br/>
planted Jane Austen's Sense and Sensibilities.  Two boxes on an<br/>
awesome hike, if I do say so myself.  Need to write the clues, which<br/>
will be a little time consuming, but still!  It's finally planted!!!<br/>
<br/>
Had to pick up a box myself, at this point, then hit Salad Works, one<br/>
of my favorite eating spots (nothing like it in Connecticut).  <br/>
<br/>
Energy replenished, on to Tyler, where I planted Doug's XTC box. <br/>
That's right, we committed to B.O.B. and then not only didn't<br/>
contribute, we then moved out of state.  I finally planted my<br/>
contributions two years ago, and this weekend got Doug's box in as<br/>
well.  I totally know you didn't think we'd follow up on this<br/>
commitment, and were worried about the void it left at Tyler.<br/>
<br/>
Of course we picked up a few boxes while we were there, then onwards<br/>
to replace the MIA Northanger Abbey. With this box replant, my Jane<br/>
Austen series - started THREE YEARS AGO - would finally be complete. <br/>
We got there, only to realize I had miscalculated the time and we<br/>
needed to leave so I could pick up Doug from his conference.  I was<br/>
THIS CLOSE to having my series done, the heavy weight on my shoulders<br/>
lifted, the long wait for my fans (hee hee) over!!  Arg, arg, arg.<br/>
<br/>
Needless to say, I left visiting the relatives early the next day so I<br/>
could come back and finish this off.  I know my priorities.  So that's<br/>
it.  I am ecstatic to say for the first time ever, the Jane Austen<br/>
Series is done.  I just need to write the clues, so nobody report<br/>
anything missing until that's done, ok?  And by the way, if you want a<br/>
good laugh, you need to get the new Northanger Abbey stamp and hold it<br/>
next to an image of the old.  What a difference three years of carving<br/>
makes.<br/>
<br/>
Did I mention I finished my Jane Austen series?  Thanks for listening!</div>

When I first started boxing Dude and I found all of these all by ourselves, a couple took several trips and tought us patience and persistance. We had so much fun discovering new places in Bucks County we had never been to, and thought it such a great adventure. This series made me fall in love with letterboxing. I am so glad to have two more to hunt, and will pick up the new Northanger Abbey stamp.

<div> </div>
<div>I realized after I posted that at least one of the boxes is still listed (I probably should have looked for Horsham in Montgomery County instead of Bucks), but several others don't seem to be listed.  Well, I had a couple incidents with that box where non-letterboxers googled Graeme park and then e-mailed me - one a Ghost Hunter who e-mailed me pictures of orbs around the house (looks just like a picture my friend took on a slightly rainy day - lots of orbs in those pictures, too).  So I decided to make it less Google-susceptible and made it an easy to solve mystery.

always a pleasure to hear from you.<br/>
