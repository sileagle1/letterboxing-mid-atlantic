Liberty Hall box a try.  It's right next door to where I work, so it <br/>
was just a short walk at lunchtime.  There was a large crowd there.  <br/>
When I went into the Visitor Center to pay the fee to get in, I was <br/>
told it was a funeral group.  The woman also asked if I was part of <br/>
the Kean College art display, so I would get student rates.  I said <br/>
no.  It's nice to know that at 38 I can still be mistaken for a <br/>
college student.  The fee for access to the "grounds only" had gone <br/>
up to $5, so that part of the clue is now a little out of date.  <br/>
Anyhow, I made a beeline for the "house in the South East corner".  <br/>
It was very easy to find, since I had studied a map before I set out, <br/>
and I had a pleasant little hike past a fairly large bed of <br/>
daffodils, through a meadow with literally thousands of dandelions <br/>
and finally past a pond complete with a weeping willow.  There were <br/>
also what appeared to be rhubarb plants growing all over the place.  <br/>
I got to the house, which had an outdoor privey to the side (I wonder <br/>
if it was still functional?), and circled around to the east corner.  <br/>
I took the specified 15 paces into the woods and turned right.  There <br/>
in the ground was an erupted root, with a cavity covered by an old <br/>
piece of concrete, just like the clue said.  Aha, I thought, <br/>
finally!  I moved the piece of concrete, and found nothing there.  <br/>
Given the size of the cavity, a box would have been hard to miss.  <br/>
Still, I ran my hand around inside, but still nothing.  I replaced <br/>
the piece of concrete the way I had found it, and left empty-handed.  <br/>
Since it had only taken me about ten minutes to get to the box site, <br/>
I took a little walk around and found a waist high hedge "maze", and <br/>
some raspberry canes.  There weren't very many plants in evidence in <br/>
the gardens, probably still too early for anything except bulbs, <br/>
yet.  I sent an e-mail along with photos of the house and root to the <br/>
placer to make sure I had the right spot.<br/>

Red Sox Nation - A.  I tried announcing this before but I think the message <br/>
was swallowed up by the Yahoo server.  Anyway, the stamp is a depiction of <br/>
the fusion between the Boston Red Sox and the Wilmington Blue Rocks.  <br/>
Unfortunately, the Blue Rocks are no longer the Single A affiliate of the <br/>
Red Sox.  Therefore, I will be retiring the box after this weekend.  I think <br/>
those who have found it enjoyed the stamp.  So, here it is . .  last chance.<br/>
<br/>
Good luck,<br/>

this message.  Pakrat - What area of NJ are you in?  I can let you <br/>
know a couple of boxes that were recently in place (as I saw them).  <br/>
You'd have to find them of course - but at least it's a start - and <br/>
they were there recently.  If interested - just drop me a note.  John.<br/>
