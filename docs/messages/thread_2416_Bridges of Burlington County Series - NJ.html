                    <div id="ygrps-yiv-1274964236">Hi all! Dave and I went out to do maintenance on the series yesterday. <br/>
We had had reports of a very damp logbook for box 2 and full logbooks <br/>
for all other boxes.<br/>
Well, Box #1 and box #2 are gone. I figure they got swept away with the <br/>
torrential rains this week; in fact, the second bridge is tilted at a <br/>
very strange angle. The rest of the series is fine, just walk on by the <br/>
first two box sites and we'll replace as soon as possible.<br/>
We brought my sister-in-law along for the hike and gave her a stamp. <br/>
Don't think she's hooked enough to go out on her own yet, though! Her <br/>
stamp is a small flower and her trail name is Senior Secretary. She <br/>
works for the Ocean County Library system, hmmmm could be a place for <br/>
another indoor box.:)<br/>
We also checked on other area boxes and they are fine. Thanks to <br/>
Gerania for keeping a watch on Batona Trail Surprise. What's the <br/>
surprise, you ask? Can you find your way back to the trail from the <br/>
box!:)<br/>
See you all the next time I'm in the area - back to RI tomorrow.<br/>

Boxer and I went looking for these and did not get very far (the trail <br/>
was impassible at a point) so we would like to give it another go when <br/>
things dry out.<br/>
<br/>
You are very right about Batona Trail Surprise.<br/>
