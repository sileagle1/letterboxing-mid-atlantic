<br/>
Well it is Saturday night and tomorrow Morning Tom and I will embark <br/>
on a journey that neither of us has ever done.  We are going camping <br/>
at Cub Scout Camp from Sunday through Wednesday.  I grew up a <br/>
surburban kinda guy in Levittown, NY.  Camping was not our family <br/>
thing.<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, we'll be up in Akelaland in Jonas PA, having a wonderful <br/>
time.  We'll be away from any internet and just goofing off.  I plan <br/>
to carve a few stamps during downtime, and maybe plant a few that <br/>
will be available only to campers (it is private property).  It will <br/>
help teach Cub Scouts compassing skills.  So if you are ever camping <br/>
at Akelaland in the future, you may want to ask for the letterboxes!  <br/>
I've got a list of stamp candidates, including the South Mountain HHH.<br/>
<br/>
So, it is with a heavy, but anticipating heart that I bid you all <br/>
adieu until Wednesday.  I did ask Tom if he wanted to go up with the <br/>
pack or hit Jacobsburg.  He opted for the former, wanting to see his <br/>
homies!  Letterboxing Dad is bumming!  Maybe on the way back home!  ;-<br/>
