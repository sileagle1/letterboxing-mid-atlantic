recently?  This past weekend I found the "Pink Lady Slipper Box" which <br/>
had not been visited recently but not the "Niki" Box (that was the <br/>
replacement box by Rick_in_Boca for the original Martian <br/>
Maggot "Crabbing Bridge" box).  After some effort, I believe I found <br/>
the spot that matched the clues, and searched the area - but no luck on <br/>
the box.  Just wondering if anyone has seen it lately.  Thanks, John.</div>

Although I haven't checked on it for quite a while, I'm confident that <br/>
Niki is still there, as it was hidden very well, in a thicket of <br/>
thorns at the rise of the hill. If anything, you wouldn't _want_ to <br/>
try to find it.<br/>
