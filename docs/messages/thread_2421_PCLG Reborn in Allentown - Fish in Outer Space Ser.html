<br/>
As minions to Rick in Boca in the Imperfect Circle Letterboxing Guild, <br/>
we have re-created the classic "Fish in Outer Space" series in <br/>
Allentown, PA.  <br/>
<br/>
<a href="http://www.atlasquest.com/lboxes/showboxinfo.html?gBoxId=38917" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.atlasquest.com/lboxes/showboxinfo.html?gBoxId=38917</a><br/>
<br/>
The original series had 3, but box #2 is actually reseonably well <br/>
preserved, but he stamp si aa bit decayed.  So, thwere is box 2b <br/>
nearby.<br/>
<br/>
The original boxes were our first finds, so it seemed appropriate to <br/>
re-create them when they had fallen to muggles and disrepair.<br/>
<br/>
Happy huntin,<br/>
<br/>

through yet, but following LB's lead, I created an AQ page:<br/>
<br/>
<a href="http://www.atlasquest.com/lboxes/clue/index.html?gBoxId=39262" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.atlasquest.com/lboxes/clue/index.html?gBoxId=39262</a><br/>
<br/>
I added the PCLG box number, in case the IPCLG wants to keep track by <br/>
box number, too. Since AQ gives you the option, I tried to re-create <br/>
the same colors as the PCLG website, but I'm not going to go through <br/>
the trouble of writing the tags for fonts and text colors.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks, LB.<br/>
