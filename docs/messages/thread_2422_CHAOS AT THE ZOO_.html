Remember:  You are being watched!  Little eyes and big eyes are just waiting to watch you <br/>
find or replace these boxes.  Please use caution.  Have an excuse:  Tie your shoe, drop <br/>
your keys, lose your frisbee.  Please take the boxes away to stamp in and then return to <br/>
their original spot.  Please repack carefully and be sure to include the string that helps you <br/>
extract the contents.  You do not need to stray out of bounds for any of these boxes.  The <br/>
Zoo charges an admission fee.<br/>
<br/>
Further enjoyment of these boxes relies on YOU and your stealth skills as a letterboxer.<br/>
<br/>
It is said, good fences make good neighbors.  So steel fences must make great neighbors.  <br/>
They sure make a great place to hide magnetic microboxes.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
ANACONDA<br/>
<br/>
	The  Anaconda has escaped from the Reptile House!  He passed up the giant tortise <br/>
because the shell always give him indigestion.  But that Southern Ground Hornbill?  <br/>
Mmmmm!  That's tasty!   As you sit on the bench peeking through the fence at the <br/>
Hornbill, know that the Anaconda waits behind the fencepost by your right foot.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
CHEETAH<br/>
<br/>
	Out on the savannah, a warthog stands.  In the bushes just 14 fence posts to the <br/>
north, a Cheetah hides watching his prey.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
THE TIGER<br/>
<br/>
	Who let the cat out?  Who?  Who? Who? Who?    The Tiger slipped through the open <br/>
gate and headed south.  He left the Tiger Terrace behind and even passed up the promise <br/>
of a nice horse dinner.  He was not even interested in ice cream.  He was hungry for <br/>
freedom!  And he was looking for the one word he had learned in all his years at the zoo: <br/>
TIXE<br/>
	The big cat crept south past the place where the humans paraded their offspring by <br/>
the buffet.  What's that smell?  Camel!  It's been years since this feline had Middle Eastern <br/>
cuisine.  But the taste of freedom would be so sweet.  Behold, the TIXE!  Up the ramp on <br/>
the right.  Oh no!  Another steel gate.  Freedom denied!<br/>
<br/>
	The Tiger waits.  Soon, when someone opens that gate, he will pounce!  Until then he <br/>
hides at the base of the last post on the ramp fence.  Just across from the sign of the <br/>
wheeled human.  Beware!<br/>
<br/>
ZEBRA<br/>
<br/>
	Find the map of Africa where the zebras and giraffes frolic with lions and <br/>
hippopotami.  The zebra hides behind the first fence post to your left.</div>

&gt; &gt; TIXE<br/>
&gt; &gt; The big cat crept south past the place where the<br/>
&gt; humans paraded their offspring by <br/>
&gt; &gt; the buffet. What's that smell? Camel! It's been<br/>
&gt; years since this feline had Middle Eastern <br/>
&gt; &gt; cuisine. But the taste of freedom would be so<br/>
&gt; sweet. Behold, the TIXE! Up the ramp on <br/>
&gt; &gt; the right. Oh no! Another steel gate. Freedom<br/>
&gt; denied!<br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; The Tiger waits. Soon, when someone opens that<br/>
&gt; gate, he will pounce! Until then he <br/>
&gt; &gt; hides at the base of the last post on the ramp<br/>
&gt; fence. Just across from the sign of the <br/>
&gt; &gt; wheeled human. Beware!<br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; ZEBRA<br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; Find the map of Africa where the zebras and<br/>
&gt; giraffes frolic with lions and <br/>
&gt; &gt; hippopotami. The zebra hides behind the first<br/>
&gt; fence post to your left.<br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>

&gt; &gt; Remember:  You are being watched!  Little eyes and big eyes are just<br/>
&gt; waiting to watch you <br/>
&gt; &gt; find or replace these boxes.  Please use caution.  Have an excuse: <br/>
&gt; Tie your shoe, drop <br/>
&gt; &gt; your keys, lose your frisbee.  Please take the boxes away to stamp<br/>
&gt; in and then return to <br/>
&gt; &gt; their original spot.  Please repack carefully and be sure to include<br/>
&gt; the string that helps you <br/>
&gt; &gt; extract the contents.  You do not need to stray out of bounds for<br/>
&gt; any of these boxes.  The <br/>
&gt; &gt; Zoo charges an admission fee.<br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; Further enjoyment of these boxes relies on YOU and your stealth<br/>
&gt; skills as a letterboxer.<br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; It is said, good fences make good neighbors.  So steel fences must<br/>
&gt; make great neighbors.  <br/>
&gt; &gt; They sure make a great place to hide magnetic microboxes.<br/>

&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; ANACONDA<br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; 	The  Anaconda has escaped from the Reptile House!  He passed up the<br/>
&gt; giant tortise <br/>
&gt; &gt; because the shell always give him indigestion.  But that Southern<br/>
&gt; Ground Hornbill?  <br/>
&gt; &gt; Mmmmm!  That's tasty!   As you sit on the bench peeking through the<br/>
&gt; fence at the <br/>
&gt; &gt; Hornbill, know that the Anaconda waits behind the fencepost by your<br/>
&gt; right foot.<br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; CHEETAH<br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; 	Out on the savannah, a warthog stands.  In the bushes just 14 fence<br/>
&gt; posts to the <br/>
&gt; &gt; north, a Cheetah hides watching his prey.<br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; THE TIGER<br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; 	Who let the cat out?  Who?  Who? Who? Who?    The Tiger slipped<br/>
&gt; through the open <br/>
&gt; &gt; gate and headed south.  He left the Tiger Terrace behind and even<br/>
&gt; passed up the promise <br/>
&gt; &gt; of a nice horse dinner.  He was not even interested in ice cream. <br/>
&gt; He was hungry for <br/>
&gt; &gt; freedom!  And he was looking for the one word he had learned in all<br/>
&gt; his years at the zoo: <br/>
&gt; &gt; TIXE<br/>
&gt; &gt; 	The big cat crept south past the place where the humans paraded<br/>

                    <div id="ygrps-yiv-1794338478">That was fun!  By far the best part of the zoo trip for me was the<br/>
F-count increase.  My mother-in-law must think I have a tiny bladder<br/>
or something, as my husband kept telling everyone that I was away from<br/>
the group for a bathroom trip.  A kid's shoe was a great reason to<br/>
lean down and check a fence, by the way.  One of my brothers-in-law is<br/>
intrigued by the whole letterboxing thing, so was happy to help cover<br/>
me while I retrieved another of them.  Thanks so much, Natty Bumpo! <br/>
And it was great to see the Crayola Posse again and meet Janila,<br/>
however briefly.<br/>
<br/>
Unfortunately, we were too tired to hit the park afterward.  We will<br/>
definately plan a trip that way in the future.<br/>
