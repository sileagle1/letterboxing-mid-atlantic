<br/>
I'm going to Philly next week for vacation and was wondering if anyone <br/>
had any recommendations for some really good boxes to go for.  Drivebys <br/>
may be preferable or short hikes since my aunt and uncle are going with <br/>
me and they're not exactly the hiking type.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks!!<br/>

I was wondering the same thing.<br/>
<br/>
Where in Philly are you folks planning on being?  Are you staying in the <br/>
city or somewhere in the suburbs?  This would help in directing you <br/>
towards nice boxes that fit in what you are looking for.<br/>
