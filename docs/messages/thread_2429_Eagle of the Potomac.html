                    <div id="ygrps-yiv-1821262265">was looking through my logbook this weekend, and found a certain stamp <br/>
that I discovered while night boxing with a head lamp on...."Eagale of <br/>
the Potomac".....it was 5 feet from a box we were after, and also <br/>
found, and hadn't been found in some time.  We lucked onto it, and <br/>
this was 2 years ago.<br/>
<br/>
It was in MD, on some long path that started with a C, ended in an O, <br/>
and had one of those crazy ampersands in between...I forget the full <br/>
name.<br/>
<br/>
any ideas?</div>
