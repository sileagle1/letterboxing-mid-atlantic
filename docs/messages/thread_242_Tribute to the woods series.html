it back in April.  They were the last to find the 2nd box in the <br/>
series.  In it, there was 2 stamps, one I think is from the 3rd box <br/>
because of the note samiam left saying that she found the stamp at <br/>
the site for the 3rd box, but no box.  Several people who signed the <br/>
log for the 4th box had said that they hadn't found the first boxes <br/>
in the series.<br/>
<br/>
I believe that the 1st stamp has been "mugglized".  There were <br/>
obvious signs of a party... charred logs, remnants of a bon-fire.  <br/>
I've emailed the placer.<br/>
