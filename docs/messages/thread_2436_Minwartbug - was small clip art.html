in.  I'm not trying to be a killjoy here but what are your search <br/>
parameters?  There's tons of great boxes in Newark, Wilmington, and <br/>
surrounding areas.  Maybe broaden your search to local towns instead of <br/>
specific parks then get the map out.  <br/>
<br/>
I have a small box full of printed clues and as I get time I try to get <br/>
lots of boxes in one area instead of driving all over.<br/>
