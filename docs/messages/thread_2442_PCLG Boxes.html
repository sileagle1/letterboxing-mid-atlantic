                    <div id="ygrps-yiv-935193325">Hello all, decided to finally get to some of the PCLG boxes I haven't <br/>
been to before today. For those that have already been there and those <br/>
who haven't- here's an update.  "A Mooving Tale" is still there. But, <br/>
the box was wet inside and although I dried it out, the stamp has <br/>
sustained damage and is starting to fall apart. I have had recent <br/>
coversations with Brain from PCLG (who moved out of the area) and I <br/>
will update him on this box and the others.  If there is a good carver <br/>
in that area that might want to try and replace that stamp - it may not <br/>
last a lot longer as it is.  It wasn't easy to get a good image as it's <br/>
starting to come apart in places. "Sneak Attack" is still in place, is <br/>
in good shape and is at the end of the 2nd log book.  Next person out <br/>
might want to bring an extra as I did not have one.  Also went to look <br/>
for "Signature" and it appears to be missing.  I found the spot where <br/>
the "field stones" cover the box as stated in the clues - but the box <br/>
was not there.  Overall - 2 out of 3 classic boxes in an 8 hr drivng <br/>
day is not a bad day at all.   The next PCLG I will be going to <br/>
is "Messenger of Peace". (And hitting some other peoples boxes in the <br/>
area) I know where it is - but if anyone can advise what shape its in - <br/>
I'll bring supplies this time if needed.  <br/>
Thanks - John.</div>
