believe that he was trying to be helpful in "adopting" the boxes.  I <br/>
certainly was not privy to any conversations between Rick, Martian <br/>
Maggot and LBNA with regard to the matter (as I was not around back <br/>
then), so I cannot comment on the details.  It does seem from her <br/>
recent post that although she moved out of the area, Martian Maggot <br/>
does care about the boxes she left behind. I hope the situation is <br/>
able to be resolved so that all concerned are in agreement and we can <br/>
continue to enjoy those boxes that were placed by Martian Magott and <br/>
that Rick was trying to help maintain.  <br/>

Kudos to Rick for doing a nice thing, and although he'll probably never <br/>
hear of it, kudos to Brian of PCLG for his willingness to graciously <br/>
transfer those boxes to new owners.<br/>
Kudos also to HelloKitty and LetterboxingBee for their adoptions of the <br/>
