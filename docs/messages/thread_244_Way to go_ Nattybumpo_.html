<div>There was a post on the main list a couple of days ago mentioning Nattybumpo's clue to "Boxing in the Dark" (I could be misquoting a little here) and said they were a riot. Well. I had to check these out and they are really funny. Evidently Nattybumpo met up with Scarab and Nightowl for some DC boxing and planted a box himself while down there. His clues are hilarious. I am sure I will never figure out where the heck his box is but just enjoyed reading the clues. I might mention again another set of clues that I really enjoyed, mostly becuase they were unique and not too much work for my lazy brain. "Blue Bears Adventure" planted by Orion in NH were just great. I met up with a NH boxers who knows these two young people and said they wanted to plant clues that even kids who had trouble reading could follow. I introduced my friend and her two kids to letterboxing while I was up there and the kids had a great time following these clues. You have to check them out.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>H&amp;H boxes are pretty standard fare, no fancy log books, no ingenious clues but we try and make up for it with great stamps. But I really do enjoy all of the effort that some folks put into their boxes. FdL's clues for the Ben Franklin series are fun and not to hard for lazy ole me and the logs are artwork. I admire the people who write and then de-code the mystery boxes. Again, not my cup of tea but how nice that it is for so many others and that they are having fun! This is a great hobby full of diverse and fun people and I just felt like giving a thumbs up to one of our newer members.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Read Nattybumpo's clues if you need a chuckle, hell read 'em even if you don't! And check out Blue Bear's Adventure clues in NH. The stamps are of the two figures Blue Bear meets up with on the trail, and they're excellent! I, being the plagerizing fool that I am, may do something similar with my dogs, Dude, Jasmine and Cody. If I can only get them to sit and stay....</div><p>

terribly true story of what REALLY happened in the woods of <br/>
McLean, VA that dark night with the Doubtful Guests is a great <br/>
story for a campfire and a cold glass of porter.<br/>

I was privleged to get the full treatment over dinner - in a <br/>
restaurant that had a letterbox behind the bar, no less.<br/>
<br/>
The BAD news about Boxing After Dark is that no one has <br/>
reported finding it yet.  A few have tried and reported no-joy.  I'm <br/>
waiting for good news from someone - and I have a cool new <br/>
First Finder prize for the winner.  It's a very public placement and <br/>
a tough recovery but I think it's do-able.  [They can't ALL be long <br/>
walks to tree stumps, can they?]<br/>
So if you're in the DC area...<br/>
<br/>
Thanks again.  See you on the trail soon...<br/>
