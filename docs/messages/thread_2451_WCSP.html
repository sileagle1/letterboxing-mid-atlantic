letterboxing.  Was able to go earlier than planned today over to WCSP <br/>
to grab some boxes there. It was just me minus the rest of my clan on <br/>
today's outing. I won't be able to make tomorrow's gathering but wanted <br/>
to at least stop by today.  I was glad I did.  I met Cyclonic and the <br/>
couple HandsTwo &amp; FishStarOne on the trail.  As my luck would have it, <br/>
I passed them the first time and then came back to where they were <br/>
chatting as I realized I was going the wrong way for a box I was <br/>
hunting.  They just happened to be standing where I needed to be.  It <br/>
was great to meet you all and I certainly appreciate the effort <br/>
Cyclonic is making in setting up tomorrow's event and planting boxes <br/>
(even though I can't make the event). I'm sure it takes alot of effort <br/>
by all involved to set these gatherings up, so hopefully I'll make it <br/>
to one eventually and I'll be glad to take a turn at grill duty.  As I <br/>
said, I wish I could be there for the fun...but then I'd probably eat <br/>
too many burgers and dogs for my own good anyway. But don't worry, I'll <br/>
never ask for any of your brussel sprouts! They're all yours!  Hope you <br/>
all have a great day.  -John</div>
