                    <div id="ygrps-yiv-1798949140">I know it seems backward, but I had planned to do my first plant <br/>
before I'd ever even found a letterbox.  I had the perfect subject, I <br/>
had written the story part, carved the stamp, printed out a first <br/>
finder certificate and put together a little prize.  I had everything <br/>
I needed.  Except, that is, a place to put it.  I had read a story in <br/>
Weird NJ about Heartbeat Road, a road where there was a water pump <br/>
house that made a sound like a beating heart every five seconds or so <br/>
(way back when before there were houses in the vicinity).  I googled <br/>
a satellite map and saw the perfect area to plant.  I found out only <br/>
later that that area had since been developed and there was a horde <br/>
of condos there now.  Don't believe a google map until you have <br/>
scouted the area in person.  The area was just off Pavan Road in <br/>
Clifton, NJ.  Here's the story I was going to put in my clue, just so <br/>
my work doesn't go to waste....:<br/>
<br/>
     She sat, arms folded, in her poodle skirt and saddle shoes, <br/>
staring straight ahead, looking bored as they drove along the back <br/>
road.<br/>
     "Want to hear an interesting story?" he asked off-handedly.<br/>
She shrugged, unsure of what they were doing, or where they were <br/>
going.  She'd never been down this road before; there were no <br/>
streetlights, only the headlights of the car and the stars overhead.<br/>
     There was a wall of trees on either side.  They were truly out <br/>
in the middle of nowhere.<br/>
     "It's about this road that we're on.  Some call it Heartbeat <br/>
Road.  Many years ago, back when this area was first settled, there <br/>
were a boy and a girl, a lot like us, walking along this road.  They <br/>
were set upon by a robber on horseback.  They started to run.  The <br/>
boy headed off into the woods, and didn't stop running until he was <br/>
quite a distance from the road.  Minutes later, he heard the <br/>
hoofbeats as the rider disappeared.  He made his way back to the <br/>
road, and quickly came upon the broken and bleeding body of his <br/>
girlfriend, palely visible in the moonlight.  He rushed to her side <br/>
and took her in his arms, cursing his cowardice.  He put his head to <br/>
her breast and heard the last feeble beats of her heart as it slowed, <br/>
and finally stopped.  He then hung himself from a nearby tree."<br/>
     She had goosebumps on her arms as he paused and stopped the car, <br/>
turning off the headlights and leaving them in darkness.<br/>
     "They say," he continued, "that if you stop along this road and <br/>
listen, you can still hear the last beats of her heart."<br/>
     He stopped talking.  There was no sound around them but the <br/>
faint rustle of the wind through the trees.  Then, in the distance..<br/>
Thump... thump.. thump.. thump.. thump..<br/>
     She couldn't tell where the sound was coming from, but it was <br/>
definitely heartbeats, about five seconds apart.<br/>
     The hairs on the back of her neck prickled.  She had never been <br/>
more terrified in her young life.  She grabbed at her boyfriend as <br/>
she stammered, "Ststart the car!  Get us out of here!"  She <br/>
continued to clutch at him holding her warm, trembling form tightly <br/>
against him.<br/>
     Obediently, he turned the key and the car started.  As they went <br/>
further along the road, the beating sound got louder, now audible <br/>
over the car's motor <br/>
     THUMP... THUMP.. THUMP..<br/>
     He could feel her nails digging into his skin, as she urged him <br/>
to go faster.<br/>
     Finally, the sound faded into the distance, and they came back <br/>
to an area that was lit, and the comforting sounds of car traffic on <br/>
the highway could be heard.<br/>
     He parked the car and put his arm around her still shaking <br/>
body.  "Are you all right?" he asked.<br/>
     She looked up at him incredulously, as he sat there calmly <br/>
stroking her hair, "Ddidn't you hear that sound back there?!"<br/>
     He raised his eyebrows for a moment and replied, "Sure.  That <br/>
was the old water pump house.  What did you think it was?"  He smiled <br/>
and kissed her on the forehead as she looked at him, stunned.<br/>
.	.	.	.	.	.	.	<br/>
<br/>
     He grinned and chuckled to himself as he drove her home, his <br/>
shoulder still smarting from where she'd punched him.<br/>
<br/>
Enjoy the brief tale, anyway.  I may use the stamp in another box <br/>
later.<br/>
