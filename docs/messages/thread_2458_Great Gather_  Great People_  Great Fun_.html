found the Cypress Cypher Series (or were those seven Sadducee <br/>

get the MD license plate box since Team Short &amp; Sweet back in October.<br/>

&gt; competent flat-water kayaker and Saturday had whitecaps driven by <br/>
25+ <br/>

Thanks to everyone who came out.  I am really glad you had a great time, <br/>
and I think I will do it again next year.<br/>
<br/>
It looks like we had more then 50 attendees, and more then 20 folks <br/>
camped, which is just amazing.  Folks came from all over, PA, Joisey, <br/>
The Lower Three, Virginia, New York (both the city and state), and the <br/>
little state with the big name, the State of Rhode Island and Providence <br/>
Plantations.<br/>
<br/>
The night boxing got high praise from all who participated, and some <br/>
folks actually did crack open Davy Jones' Locker.<br/>
<br/>
While it was a ton of work, I am by far not the only one to thank.<br/>
<br/>
Boxes came from The Royal Fish, Celtic Cat, Indigo Vulture, and Hikers <br/>
and Hounds.  They were all great.  Several stamps from MizScarlett, <br/>
including the fantastic Starry, Starry Night, were including in the <br/>
night boxing.  SewSowBizzy made her famous coffee in the morning, and my <br/>
room mate Matt prepared his now famous burgers.  So everyone came <br/>
together to make this gathering happen.<br/>

work but it did. I was a much different experience<br/>
being on the trail in the dark. Had to discourage over<br/>
enthusiastic boxers in our group from going off the<br/>
marked trail to look for boxes they missed during<br/>
daylght. It was a little spooky in the woods, I was<br/>
glad to hear the chatter of the other groups behind<br/>
us. This kind of activity at a gather might encourage<br/>
more people to hang around and camp.<br/>

                    <div id="ygrps-yiv-916038917">Thanks so much to Cyclonic for organizing this event!  Other than the occasional rain (not our fault!), the weather was perfect.  We had a great time meeting people, exchanging stamps, and finding boxes.  We hope to visit the park again to find more of the boxes.  The kids seemed to have a great time seeing Dude and climbing trees with the other youngsters (there was no river to fall into!).  I've been inspired to start carving again with some new stamps for the family and perhaps travelers for the kids.  My kids were also fascinated with Davy Jones' Locker though they might not have the patience to solve it.<br/>
<br/>
One of the best things about going to the gather was unadvertised - all that time hiking and playing outside managed to reset the kids' internal clocks.  Before the gather, they were waking up around 5:30-6am.  Today when I left the house at 6:45 am, they were both still in bed!  Thank youuuuuuuu!<br/>

&gt; Subject: Re: [lbma] Great Gather!  Great People!  Great Fun!<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Now that I have gotten some sleep...<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Thanks to everyone who came out.  I am really glad you had a great time, <br/>
&gt; and I think I will do it again next year.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; It looks like we had more then 50 attendees, and more then 20 folks <br/>
&gt; camped, which is just amazing.  Folks came from all over, PA, Joisey, <br/>
&gt; The Lower Three, Virginia, New York (both the city and state), and the <br/>
&gt; little state with the big name, the State of Rhode Island and Providence <br/>
&gt; Plantations.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; The night boxing got high praise from all who participated, and some <br/>
&gt; folks actually did crack open Davy Jones' Locker.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; While it was a ton of work, I am by far not the only one to thank.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Boxes came from The Royal Fish, Celtic Cat, Indigo Vulture, and Hikers <br/>
&gt; and Hounds.  They were all great.  Several stamps from MizScarlett, <br/>
&gt; including the fantastic Starry, Starry Night, were including in the <br/>
&gt; night boxing.  SewSowBizzy made her famous coffee in the morning, and my <br/>
&gt; room mate Matt prepared his now famous burgers.  So everyone came <br/>
&gt; together to make this gathering happen.<br/>

great time.  We enjoyed the exchanges and the overnight.  Great <br/>
food, great bonfire, great company.  Hubby is even considering Tyler <br/>
park in December.  Thanks, you made us newbies feel right at home, <br/>
we had a blast. We, unfortunately, got very little boxing done on <br/>
Saturday between exchanges and setting up camp.  We joined Wanda on <br/>
Sunday to do the Homestar series, the insects and trashed.  Boy is <br/>
she a bundle of energy.  Certainly got a workout.  Bill had to stay <br/>
back with the kids because they didn't want to letterbox. We went <br/>
home earlier than I would have liked because daughter was getting <br/>
ansy and wanted to get home to play with her friend before she had <br/>
to leave.  But we had a great time and can't wait to do it again.  <br/>
See you all on the trails!<br/>

 year.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; It looks like we had more then 50 attendees, and more then 20 folks <br/>&gt; camped, which is just amazing. Folks came from all over, PA, Joisey, <br/>&gt; The Lower Three, Virginia, New York (both the city and state), and the <br/>&gt; little state with the big name, the State of Rhode Island and Providence <br/>&gt; Plantations.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; The night boxing got high praise from all who participated, and some <br/>&gt; folks actually did crack open Davy Jones' Locker.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; While it was a ton of work, I am by far not the only one to thank.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Boxes came from The Royal Fish, Celtic Cat, Indigo Vulture, and Hikers <br/>&gt; and Hounds. They were all great. Several stamps from MizScarlett, <br/>&gt; including the fantastic Starry, Starry Night, were including in the <br/>&gt; night boxing. SewSowBizzy made her famous coffee in the morning, and my <br/>&gt; room mate Matt prepared his now famous burgers. So everyone came <br/>&gt;
 together to make this gathering happen.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; -- <br/>&gt; Nathan Brown<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; AKA Cyclonic<br/>&gt; Penncoasters.com<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; The Insensitivity rolls on...<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Real men don't do pastels.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; <br/>&gt; Yahoo!
