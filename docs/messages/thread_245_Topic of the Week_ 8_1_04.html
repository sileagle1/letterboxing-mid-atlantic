<div> </div>
<div>I've given a lot of thought to this and realize I don't have a frame of reference on which to base my hypothesis (the current Mr. Irene is a scientist and he ALWAYS talks like this, even if I'm asking him if he thinks we need dog food LOL!). I can already see a difference since I started this past January, so I can't imagine a year or five years from now. I'll bet Silent Doug has seen a tremendous amount of change just in the last 2 years or so.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>What I hope for are lot's of great boxes in neat places hidden by some really cool boxers. A good relationship with the PADNRC, or none at all (wink, wink, nudge, nudge say no more). To be allowed to plant and hike unfettered as long as we respect and care for the land we are enjoying. I keep thinking with horror of the mess down in GA and hope that never happens here. I would like the Mid-Altantic region state and county parks embrace letterboxingthe way many of the New England parks have. How can we make that happen? </div>
<div> </div>
<div>I think we are already on the way to a great community with lot's of funny, different and interesting people with a variety of likes and dislikes which should make boxing around here very interesting and diverse.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>I appreciate Silent Doug and Jennifer's efforts to restore our early "historical" boxes and hope to search as many as possible so I can continue to understand and respect how much effort went into getting this hobby going in the US. It's just amazing when you think of what a handful of folks have accomplished in a few short years. I hope to never forget their efforts and am glad that someone is taking the time to keep the history of this hobby intact.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Wow, I feel like I am writing a campaign speech! "And to close, my fellow Americans...read my lips...no new taxes"! LOL!<br/><br/><b><i>fleurdelislb &lt;fleurdelislb@...&gt;</i></b> wrote:</div>

<div> </div>
<div>Plus geocaching is harder on the environment.  Since they have no clues for the last 30 feet, geocachers find themselves tramping all over looking for the dang box, turning over every rock, stick and leaf in sight.  One method for locating a cache is called the spiral.  You walk in an ever widening spiral looking all over.  Yet of all the geocaches I have looked for I seldom see much environmental damage.  Nature covers its tracks.</div>

                    <div id="ygrps-yiv-1550194529">Geocaching actually has more members than letterboxing in our region, and <br/>
probably every region outside of CT. For an example in my neighborhood, a <br/>
geocache in Carol Anne Farms Park in Virginia Beach has 100 finds logged, <br/>
while Lone Pony's letterboxes in the same park seem to have had at most 30 <br/>
stamps (both have been placed long enough for everyone in the region in the <br/>
respective hobbies to find). In Fountainhead Park in northern Virginia, the <br/>
ratio between Shaggy (Creature of Fountainhead #5) and the geocache twenty <br/>
paces away was closer (at least when I found them last fall), but still with <br/>
more cachers.<br/>
<br/>
Basic GPS units cost around $100 or so, which I think would put them in the <br/>
same magnitude as Game Boys and such. I don't think cost is a factor. Some <br/>
people prefer gadgetry while others prefer artistry. The outdoors should be <br/>
big enough for both.<br/>
<br/>
The larger numbers mean that geocaching has had more scrutiny. They have <br/>
also responded to such scrutiny. In some areas, regional groups have formed <br/>
to work out arrangements and rules packages with park systems that were on <br/>
the fence as far as access. As a whole, geocaching at least as represented <br/>
by geocaching.com, obeys any regulations that are posted or announced by <br/>
land managers, like them or not. The theory is to cooperate with land <br/>
managers and lobby for favorable rules in the future. It makes more sense to <br/>
stay out of the hair of someone who doesn't want letterboxing and geocaching <br/>
around and hope they (or successors) change their minds than it does to have <br/>
repeated confrontations and try to wear an unfriendly park agency down. Park <br/>
agencies won't wear down in that manner. They'll remember groups and <br/>
activities that cause what they percieve to be problems.<br/>
<br/>
While I haven't gone for the uber sized numbers that others persue, I have <br/>
been doing both geocaching (no GPS for me, I plot lat and long onto topo <br/>
maps) and letterboxing for over three years. Back when I started, there <br/>
weren't enough letterboxes nor geocaches individually to make a decent <br/>
hobby, so I started doing both and continue to do both. I fully believe that <br/>
no harm can come to any enviroment due to letterboxing or geocaching; <br/>
Scarab's "spiral search" observation of no impact ("Nature covers its <br/>
tracks") is relevant and I know from orienteering (it's been formally <br/>
studied) that even the biggest (15,000+ participants in Scandinavia) events <br/>
in that sport produce no lasting impact on the land either. We are <br/>
absolutely harmless to the enviroment and the problem is convincing the <br/>
troublesome land managers to acknowledge that.<br/>
<br/>
I saw the notes for Delaware's problems. That is something that has just <br/>
happened in the last few weeks and the geocachers are getting hit too. There <br/>
is a small regional group called Delaware Geocaching through groups.msn.com <br/>
if any Delaware Letterboxers want to communicate with the them, maybe <br/>
coordinate your lobbying efforts. Since this is the first problem in <br/>
Delaware, they aren't as organized as cachers are in some other states. The <br/>
reason given so far is impact trails (bogus, there aren't enough cachers nor <br/>
letterboxers to cause those in Delaware either), but the suddenness of the <br/>
parks' change of heart suggests that some violation or offense (by cachers?, <br/>
boxers?, who knows?) occured somewhere. Delaware State Parks had been open <br/>
to both hobbies until the last few weeks.<br/>
<br/>
I went ahead and joined LbSE since I have some letterboxes down there <br/>
anyway, so any further Georgia State Park thoughts will go there in a few <br/>
days. But that is one example of a regional caching group working with an <br/>
unfriendly park agency to try to turn them around. I suspect some of the <br/>
"silly rules" mentioned here refer to "locked boxes in the visitor center" <br/>
mentioned in the GSP policies. That's actually a compromise marshalled by a <br/>
Georgia geocacher. Obviously not ideal down there, but still a small <br/>
improvement over the "absolute NO" that the Georgia State Parks had been <br/>
giving. More on the other list in a few days.<br/>
<br/>
As far as the original topic question, I think Scarab is right on the money. <br/>
I can't imagine there are any park agencies that don't know about <br/>
geocaching, and like it or not, letterboxing is going to be grouped with <br/>
them, since at the most basic level we are the same (hiding objects for <br/>
others to find). We are going to have to start transitioning to accept park <br/>
rules fully. One advantage is that the other guys (geocachers) have done <br/>
most of the work for us. Between geocachingpolicy.info and the regional <br/>
geocaching groups, we know what the rules are just about everywhere, with <br/>
Delaware SPs an exception, since they are in the midst of changing theirs. <br/>
And most of the trouble spots have groups that are working on solutions, <br/>
admittedly with different degrees of success. But letterboxing doesn't have <br/>
to start from scratch on any of these issues.<br/>
<br/>
One final note, as if this wasn't long enough already. The first Mapsurfer <br/>
box (I'm not saying which one) that I sought and found is in a grossly <br/>
illegal spot. Since Mapsurfer boxes are prized, I went anyway. Spending 75% <br/>
of my time and effort in that location worrying about being caught by the <br/>
land manager greatly lessened the fun of that find. This is only a hobby. <br/>
It's not worth any kind of serious trouble. It might be disheartening to <br/>
know that "your favorite park" or a certain "really cool spot" doesn't <br/>
support this hobby, but there are plenty of outstanding parks that do. I <br/>
believe our hobby will be better off if we support the parks that support us <br/>
and ignore the ones that don't want us right now.<br/>
<br/>
Happy letterboxing.<br/>
<br/>

&gt;Regardless of the number of members Geocaching has 10 times the number of <br/>
&gt;boxes.  That means more impact on the environment and perhaps more <br/>
&gt;potential scrutiny by humorless authorities.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Plus geocaching is harder on the environment.  Since they have no clues for <br/>
&gt;the last 30 feet, geocachers find themselves tramping all over looking for <br/>
&gt;the dang box, turning over every rock, stick and leaf in sight.  One method <br/>
&gt;for locating a cache is called the spiral.  You walk in an ever widening <br/>
&gt;spiral looking all over.  Yet of all the geocaches I have looked for I <br/>
&gt;seldom see much environmental damage.  Nature covers its tracks.<br/>

I'd like to add this: some people think that it's just too much <br/>
effort to get permissions even for individual boxes, never mind <br/>
trying to get the PTB to change their policies. When it gets to be <br/>
work, they stop having fun. Others see these efforts as foundation <br/>
building, which is important if there is to be any longevity to the <br/>
hobby (or to the boxes themselves).<br/>

It might be disheartening to <br/>know that "your favorite park" or a certain "really cool spot" doesn't <br/>support this hobby, but there are plenty of outstanding parks that do. I <br/>believe our hobby will be better off if we support the parks that support us <br/>and ignore the ones that
 don't want us right now.<br/><br/>Happy letterboxing.<br/><br/>Mike<br/><br/>&gt;Message: 2<br/>&gt;    Date: Wed, 4 Aug 2004 05:18:36 -0700 (PDT)<br/>&gt;    From: The Doubtful Guests &lt;thedoubtfulguests@...&gt;<br/>&gt;Subject: Re: Re: Topic of the Week: 8/1/04<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;Regardless of the number of members Geocaching has 10 times the number of <br/>&gt;boxes.  That means more impact on the environment and perhaps more <br/>&gt;potential scrutiny by humorless authorities.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;Plus geocaching is harder on the environment.  Since they have no clues for <br/>&gt;the last 30 feet, geocachers find themselves tramping all over looking for <br/>&gt;the dang box, turning over every rock, stick and leaf in sight.  One method <br/>&gt;for locating a cache is called the spiral.  You walk in an ever widening <br/>&gt;spiral looking all over.  Yet of all the geocaches I have looked for I <br/>&gt;seldom see much environmental
 damage.  Nature covers its tracks.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;Scarab<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;Judy B &lt;sowbiz@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;But doesn't geocaching (which I haven't done) require the use of a<br/>&gt;GPS (as in GP$$$$$)?  If it is more<br/>&gt;sophisticated/complicated/expensive it may have a smaller or more<br/>&gt;descrete following - despite the number of caches they put out.<br/>&gt;Am I making the wrong assumption?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;Judy B<br/>&gt;sewsowbizzy<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;--- In lbma@yahoogroups.com, The Doubtful Guests<br/>&gt;&lt;thedoubtfulguests@y...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; &gt; In the next year, or few, I wonder if we will see a difficult<br/>&gt;transition from the days of "don't ask don't tell" to boxes with<br/>&gt;parks' permissions, and other parks more aware of and banning and<br/>&gt;pulling them.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; That's just me being pessimistic about publicity.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Yet geocaching has 10 times as many caches as we have boxes and<br/>&gt;they are
