first event a great one.  So many of you were very kind and welcoming <br/>
to us we just really appreciate it.  For us it was a perfect mix of <br/>
boxing and meeting new people.  We are anxious to see you all again.  <br/>
If any of you get down the York way, let us know!  We'd love to meet up <br/>
with you.<br/>
