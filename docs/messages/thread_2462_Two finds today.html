arrival in Crownsville, one I have passed several times and did not go <br/>
in to find. A nice walk to a nice box and stamp. Also we found <br/>
Cedarville in the Cedarville state park in Prince Georges county. This <br/>
was a nice park and also a nice quiet, peaceful walk to a nice box. We <br/>
enjoyed our day out and about learning more about Maryland. <br/>
<br/>
Sounds like you all had a wonderful time at the gather this weekend. I <br/>
am sorry we missed it. We had signed up to come to the June 8th <br/>
gathering but our plans were changed for us so we will be unable to <br/>
attend. Hopefully next time as it sounds like you are having a great <br/>
time.:o) <br/>
