                    <div id="ygrps-yiv-2072154544">On my second trip to Eagle Rock, I went to look for "We Will Never <br/>
Forget" first.  Not much to say about this one except that it was my <br/>
first found box ever!  It was quite close to the south wall between a <br/>
tree trunk and the large brown boulder mentioned in the clue, under a <br/>
SPOR.  It was in sad shape, though.  About the only undamaged things <br/>
in it were the stamp itself and the markers used to ink it.  The log <br/>
pages were a sodden mess, and it wasn't even in a box.  The torn <br/>
ziplocs were in an equally torn plastic shopping bag.  Still, it was <br/>
well hidden.  I left the old log there, not really knowing what I <br/>
could do to salvage it.  I did leave a new spiral bound logbook in a <br/>
new double lock freezer bag.  I couldn't seem to get the double sided <br/>
stamp to line up right, even though I tried twice.<br/>
<br/>
Next I went for "Gabriella's Flag" again, and this time I found it.  <br/>
Did I feel foolish!  The first time I'd looked for it, I was WAY off <br/>
track.  I guess I hadn't been paying attention to the yellow blazes <br/>
on the trees, and had gone straight at the fork instead of turning <br/>
left to follow the yellow trail.  There was a yellow blazed tree <br/>
which had rotted in the center and fallen across the path, but it was <br/>
easily climbed over.  After that it was very easy to find the blue <br/>
trailhead.  I followed it and found the "tree in the middle of the <br/>
trail ending a bed of rock".  Up ahead, at fifty paces I found <br/>
the "large tree directly on the left" and sighted a number of large <br/>
rocks at 280 degrees.  I walked past them, and as I turned to go <br/>
back, I saw the box, partially exposed, in a space underneath one of <br/>
the larger boulders.  This box was in much better condition.  I <br/>
didn't take much time to look through the logbook (maybe next time <br/>
I'm up there), except to note that I was only the second person to <br/>
find the box this year, both of us in May.  I hid the box so that it <br/>
was not visible, went back to my car and returned home.  All told it <br/>
took maybe 30-40 minutes to find both boxes, stamp in and be back on <br/>
the road.  Not bad for my first real letterboxing experience.<br/>
