Oh, you mean the stuff I made the RedHat Box'rs stamp from.<br/>
<br/>
Well, it was never planted outdoors but as a 'personal/group traveler' <br/>
it has lasted 2.5 years. <br/>
<br/>
But I can't imagine why it wouldn't work in a box.  You might try<br/>
freezing and thawing one to test its recovery.  Or leave it in a hot<br/>
car . . . does it smoosh?<br/>
