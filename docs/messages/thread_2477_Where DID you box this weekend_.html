letterboxes.  The first one was at a rest stop and when we opened it <br/>
up found our very first hitchhiker!!  We were very excited.  Also <br/>
while there we saw a bird we'd never seen before (I'm bit of a <br/>
birdwatcher) so it was a very rewarding stop.  The second one was a <br/>
bit more challenging -- the clues said "steep" but in my opinion <br/>
should have read "need repelling gear."  It was also a box that had <br/>
been reported missing, but we found it!!  After that box, I felt we <br/>
deserved a stop at DQ ;)<br/>

Oh, man! I do *not* envy you having to deal with the crowds at VA Beach
on Memorial Day weekend! Yuk!<br/>
<br/>
We had our worst boxing weekend on record. On Sunday, we tried for 3
easy drive-bys in Poolsville, MD only to be utterly foiled by masses of
poison ivy. On a positive note, we did get to tour the old one-room
schoolhouse. We'll try again in the winter...<br/>
<br/>
On Monday we boxed locally at Pocahontas SP in Chesterfield, VA. We
weren't really expecting to find the boxes we were hunting, and we
didn't. We were hunting a series planted by Ladybug and the Itchy Butt
Girls back in 2000. We found box 1 and could not find box 2 a couple of
years ago, and were unable to attempt boxes 3-5 at that time as they
were expanding the campground and access to the section of trail where
the boxes were was cut off. We tried again yesterday - the trail is
open again although one of the loops is now part of the campground. The
trails are so poorly maintained that we were hopeful that the old
landmarks would still be in place, and in fact every ladnmark was still
in place, even when they should not have been due to the changes to the
trail, but the final landmark was, of course, gone. Since boxes 4 &amp;
5 piggyback off of box 3 all three are now inaccessible. Well, anyway,
it was a nice hike...<br/>

</span></blockquote>I had a wonderful weekend out !<br/>
<br/>
Sheba and I headed out to the State College area for the weekend, <br/>
staying at SB Elliott State Park and we got tons of boxing in.<br/>
<br/>
On the way out we went up through the Altoona area.  We stopped at <br/>
Through Creek State Park where we got Balanced Rock, which is on a short <br/>
walk along a fantastic trail.  On the way there we stopped at this <br/>
funky, interesting little Museum, the Broad Top Miners Museum, which was <br/>
in an old movie theater.  We then visited Chimney Rock Park where we got <br/>
Slinky.  Then we hit the Amusement parks in the area, Lakemont Park and <br/>
Delgrossos Amusement Park.  We finally finished the day with Halcyon <br/>
Days, a great hike with a 1000 foot climb.  We finally came off that <br/>
mountain at 9PM in the dark.<br/>
<br/>
Needless to say, we did not get an early start on Sunday, rolling into <br/>
Bellefonte at about 11.  Bellefonte is a beautiful town, and the county <br/>
seat of Centre County.  There we took our time and found Chimney <br/>
Swifts.  We found Bush house to be missing, as well as Inverted Jenny.  <br/>
We then ventured out of town to find Anna Keichline, an excellent box <br/>
BTW, and spent a long time trying to figure out where Wild Iris was, <br/>
exploring the Fisherman's Paradise Hatchery before almost giving up when <br/>
it dawned on me where the box might be, and it was there.  At least we <br/>
had no problem finding Red Poppy.<br/>
<br/>
Finally getting into State College, we sat down at Creamery and had some <br/>
ice cream and met up with Lotus and Leafcutter before heading off to dinner.<br/>
<br/>
I really have to thank Crayola Posse for hosting a little get together <br/>
to a local brewpub, Ottos.  It was just a fantastic time, and I just <br/>
could not thank Terri and Jim enough.<br/>
<br/>
After dinner Sheba and I did a little tour of the campus and picked up a <br/>
bunch of the Huntin' boxes.  We finally finished up at about midnight, <br/>
though there are still more boxes to be had.<br/>
<br/>
Monday was Mount Nittany day.  We found four of the five Mystery Tour <br/>

<p>As I told the eeeevil one, Joe has stopped making me do so 
  much<br/>housework and I was able to get out and find some boxes this 
  weekend.<br/>Finally filled up my logbook (although I'm only at 113 finds, but 
  I'm<br/>not in it for the numbers). We found 2 in Emmaus and then 3 at 
  Mt.<br/>Misery today. Was doing some recon on some Mapsurferian

head for a campground.  On Saturday, the kids and I took a coworker<br/>
and her daughter for their first boxing trip. Most of the boxes are<br/>
mysteries, so I won't say which park.  I think we got them hooked too.<br/>
 They found 3, but we only got 2 because one we already got.  We<br/>
attempted another, but my kids got too tired and it was more an<br/>
exercise in getting out of the woods than searching for a box by then.<br/>
 Still 7 or 8 more in that park to find!  Sunday we packed up the<br/>
bikes and headed to Reading for the Gring's Mill boxes.  It was a<br/>
great day for a ride in a great park.  The kids had a wonderful time,<br/>
and we got 2 out of the 3 boxes there too.  Monday was a work day to<br/>
finish things around the house.<br/>

chance to hike Nittany with friends, find a new box, finally meet a boxer we have looked <br/>
up to for years and bend our elbows with good friends.<br/>
<br/>
Fifteen letterboxers showed up Sunday evening at Otto's where we laughed and exchanged <br/>
stories and stamps for hours. If you read my blog, you will know of some stresses I was <br/>
under and I have to thank everyone that came for being the highlight of a long weekend <br/>
for me. Everyone one of you is a top notch boxer, I went to check on many of my campus <br/>
boxes today and they were hidden better than I had left them.<br/>
<br/>
Thank you for everything!<br/>

&gt; <br/>
&gt; Sheba and I headed out to the State College area for the weekend, <br/>
&gt; staying at SB Elliott State Park and we got tons of boxing in.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; On the way out we went up through the Altoona area.  We stopped at <br/>
&gt; Through Creek State Park where we got Balanced Rock, which is on a short <br/>
&gt; walk along a fantastic trail.  On the way there we stopped at this <br/>
&gt; funky, interesting little Museum, the Broad Top Miners Museum, which was <br/>
&gt; in an old movie theater.  We then visited Chimney Rock Park where we got <br/>

&gt; Swifts.  We found Bush house to be missing, as well as Inverted Jenny.  <br/>
&gt; We then ventured out of town to find Anna Keichline, an excellent box <br/>
&gt; BTW, and spent a long time trying to figure out where Wild Iris was, <br/>
&gt; exploring the Fisherman's Paradise Hatchery before almost giving up when <br/>
&gt; it dawned on me where the box might be, and it was there.  At least we <br/>
&gt; had no problem finding Red Poppy.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Finally getting into State College, we sat down at Creamery and had some <br/>
&gt; ice cream and met up with Lotus and Leafcutter before heading off to dinner.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I really have to thank Crayola Posse for hosting a little get together <br/>
&gt; to a local brewpub, Ottos.  It was just a fantastic time, and I just <br/>
&gt; could not thank Terri and Jim enough.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; After dinner Sheba and I did a little tour of the campus and picked up a <br/>
&gt; bunch of the Huntin' boxes.  We finally finished up at about midnight, <br/>
&gt; though there are still more boxes to be had.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Monday was Mount Nittany day.  We found four of the five Mystery Tour <br/>
&gt; boxes, but were not prepared to bushwack to the last, though I am pretty <br/>
&gt; sure I know where it is.  Zion was our major goal, and Sheba found it <br/>
&gt; without a problem.  We did not find Fibonacci Spiral, but we did find <br/>
&gt; the new Archaeobirder box as well as something else.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; We then headed down to Boalsburgs where we said goodbye to Crayola <br/>
&gt; Posse, visited the 28th Division Shrine and found Thanks A Lotte.  We <br/>
&gt; finally got home exhausted, but boy, when a great weekend.<br/>

and some other cool boxes. It was not such much as me being clever as <br/>
checking certain antomy parts to pull the box out of after scouring the <br/>
area and trying many theories out. I don't know a fibonoci from a <br/>
realonoci! After being such a slacker all weekend, it was nice to <br/>
actually nice to help find a box! <br/>

&gt; -we left a lot undone that I wish we'd had time for (we got only the <br/>
&gt; first box of the Elms series, for example) &amp; I'd like to get a chance <br/>
&gt; to explore some more &amp; maybe plant up there.  There are so many <br/>
&gt; beautiful parks.  Next time though I will remember to wear something <br/>
&gt; blue &amp; white so I blend in....<br/>

&gt; &gt; I had a wonderful weekend out !<br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; Sheba and I headed out to the State College area for the weekend, <br/>
&gt; &gt; staying at SB Elliott State Park and we got tons of boxing in.<br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; On the way out we went up through the Altoona area. We stopped at <br/>
&gt; &gt; Through Creek State Park where we got Balanced Rock, which is on a <br/>
&gt; short <br/>
&gt; &gt; walk along a fantastic trail. On the way there we stopped at this <br/>
&gt; &gt; funky, interesting little Museum, the Broad Top Miners Museum, <br/>
&gt; which was <br/>
&gt; &gt; in an old movie theater. We then visited Chimney Rock Park where we <br/>
&gt; got <br/>
&gt; &gt; Slinky. Then we hit the Amusement parks in the area, Lakemont Park <br/>
&gt; and <br/>
&gt; &gt; Delgrossos Amusement Park. We finally finished the day with Halcyon <br/>
&gt; &gt; Days, a great hike with a 1000 foot climb. We finally came off that <br/>
&gt; &gt; mountain at 9PM in the dark.<br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; Needless to say, we did not get an early start on Sunday, rolling <br/>
&gt; into <br/>
&gt; &gt; Bellefonte at about 11. Bellefonte is a beautiful town, and the <br/>
&gt; county <br/>
&gt; &gt; seat of Centre County. There we took our time and found Chimney <br/>
&gt; &gt; Swifts. We found Bush house to be missing, as well as Inverted <br/>
&gt; Jenny. <br/>
&gt; &gt; We then ventured out of town to find Anna Keichline, an excellent <br/>
&gt; box <br/>
&gt; &gt; BTW, and spent a long time trying to figure out where Wild Iris <br/>
&gt; was, <br/>
&gt; &gt; exploring the Fisherman's Paradise Hatchery before almost giving up <br/>
&gt; when <br/>
&gt; &gt; it dawned on me where the box might be, and it was there. At least <br/>
&gt; we <br/>
&gt; &gt; had no problem finding Red Poppy.<br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; Finally getting into State College, we sat down at Creamery and had <br/>
&gt; some <br/>
&gt; &gt; ice cream and met up with Lotus and Leafcutter before heading off <br/>
&gt; to dinner.<br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; I really have to thank Crayola Posse for hosting a little get <br/>
&gt; together <br/>
&gt; &gt; to a local brewpub, Ottos. It was just a fantastic time, and I just <br/>
&gt; &gt; could not thank Terri and Jim enough.<br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; After dinner Sheba and I did a little tour of the campus and picked <br/>
&gt; up a <br/>
&gt; &gt; bunch of the Huntin' boxes. We finally finished up at about <br/>
&gt; midnight, <br/>
&gt; &gt; though there are still more boxes to be had.<br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; Monday was Mount Nittany day. We found four of the five Mystery <br/>
&gt; Tour <br/>
&gt; &gt; boxes, but were not prepared to bushwack to the last, though I am <br/>
&gt; pretty <br/>
&gt; &gt; sure I know where it is. Zion was our major goal, and Sheba found <br/>
&gt; it <br/>
&gt; &gt; without a problem. We did not find Fibonacci Spiral, but we did <br/>
&gt; find <br/>
&gt; &gt; the new Archaeobirder box as well as something else.<br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; We then headed down to Boalsburgs where we said goodbye to Crayola <br/>
&gt; &gt; Posse, visited the 28th Division Shrine and found Thanks A Lotte. <br/>
&gt; We <br/>
&gt; &gt; finally got home exhausted, but boy, when a great weekend.<br/>

&gt; &gt; Basically...what he said. =) Also there actually was a box in the <br/>
&gt; park where we were staying--Be There Bison Set, a nice hike with a <br/>
&gt; great stamp which was our pre-breakfast warm-up for Mt. Nittany.<br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; The time at Otto's was great, gave me a chance to meet some new <br/>
&gt; faces: Lit Chick, Thick or Thin, MsBeachys &amp; Waiting for Snow (we'd <br/>
&gt; seen their stamps in some of the boxes we found) along with <br/>
&gt; their "Excess Baggage." It turned out that these last 3 folks were <br/>
&gt; also caver friends of Irene's--small world!<br/>
