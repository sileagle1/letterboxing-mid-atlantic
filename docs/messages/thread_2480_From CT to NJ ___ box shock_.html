<br/>
We are not new to letterboxing, but we are new to boxing in the PA/NJ <br/>
area. We got our start in Connecticutt, where we went to college. We <br/>
graduated last May and moved back to New Jersey (where I grew up). I <br/>
can't believe how sparse boxes are on my side of the river! We are <br/>
across the river from Philadelphia.. and boxes here are slim pickins! <br/>
<br/>
We did have a good a Memorial Day weekend for boxing.. we went to <br/>
Nockamixon State Park and got a few boxes.. we did the Ice Age Series <br/>
and definitly got lost on the way to the peak, and on our way back :) <br/>
It was a hoot, but we never found 4 or 5 because we couldn't even see <br/>
a trail between boxes 3 and 6 :) <br/>
<br/>
Does anyone know any boxes with beautiful mountain views within 2 <br/>
hours drive of Philly? My poor fiance David is dying in flat South <br/>
Jersey after spending 4 years in the mountains of CT! We love HARD <br/>
EXHAUSTING hikes with a prize at the end... any suggestions?<br/>
<br/>

driving range:<br/>
Pinnacle in Berks County, PA ( I did this in my pre-boxing day- <br/>
excellent hike)<br/>
Hawk Mountain (just around the corner- although I am not sure if the <br/>
box is still there but the hike is worth it either way)<br/>
Mt Misery at Valley Forge (this is that terribly hard, but it's a <br/>
nice hike)<br/>
Also try Lehigh Mountain in Fountain Hill and South Mountain in <br/>
Emmaus- nice boxes nice hikes.<br/>

Good Luck &amp; glad you enjoyed the Ice Age Series.<br/>

French Creek in Eastern Berks County has many a box with many a <br/>
climb.  Though the hills are forested, sometimes you can get a good <br/>
view from there.  I echo the sentiment on the Pinnacle Hike and <br/>
anything near the Delaware Water Gap (PA and NJ sides) for views and <br/>
some decent exercise.<br/>

</span></blockquote>Welcome to the asylum.  Where is Joisey are you living?<br/>
<br/>
I wouldn't say that it is slim pickings in South Joisey, there just are <br/>
not nearly as many as there are in CT.  You may also want to use several <br/>
different sources, Atlasquest, Letterboxing.org, and other personal <br/>
sites as people do not always post clues everywhere.  There are a lot of <br/>
mystery boxes.<br/>

"The Great Divide".  Your best bet would be to head north or cross over <br/>
there river.  Pinnacle in Hamburg, PA come highly recommended.  There <br/>
are a bunch of boxes up there, and it is a fairly hard hike.  French <br/>
Creek State Park may also be up your ally, lots of good hikes there.<br/>

                    <div id="ygrps-yiv-2076483523">I second what Carole said. Also, there are two more ridges that have <br/>
nice plants and views; the Ramapo escarpment (runs along the east side <br/>
of 287 in Morris and Passaic Counties) and the first Watchung Mountain <br/>
extending from Somerset Coounty all the way up into Bergen. It's not a <br/>
really high ridge, but you get NYC skyline views from the top, which is <br/>
cool.<br/>
For long, hard hikes, try any of the older boxes by Wingfoot.<br/>
For a "sampler pack" of NJ terrain, do my Physiography series: one box <br/>
in each region working you from the flats all the way up to the <br/>
Kittatinny ridge.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1005095974ygrp-text">
<p>Hello everyone!<br/><br/>We are not new to letterboxing, but we are new to 
  boxing in the PA/NJ <br/>area. We got our start in Connecticutt, where we went 
  to college. We <br/>graduated last May and moved back to New Jersey (where I 
  grew up). I <br/>can't believe how sparse boxes are on my side of the river! We 
  are <br/>across the river from Philadelphia. . and boxes here are slim 
  pickins! <br/><br/>We did have a good a Memorial Day weekend for boxing.. we 
  went to <br/>Nockamixon State Park and got a few boxes.. we did the Ice Age 
  Series <br/>and definitly got lost on the way to the peak, and on our way back 
  :) <br/>It was a hoot, but we never found 4 or 5 because we couldn't even see 
  <br/>a trail between boxes 3 and 6 :) <br/><br/>Does anyone know any boxes with 
  beautiful mountain views within 2 <br/>hours drive of Philly? My poor fiance 
  David is dying in flat South <br/>Jersey after spending 4 years in the 
  mountains of CT! We love HARD <br/>EXHAUSTING hikes with a prize at the end... 
  any 
  suggestions?<br/><br/>Thanks!<br/><br/>Sara<br/><br/>Team*HappilyEverAft er*<br/><br/>P.S. 
  We are planning on getting more boxes in the area by planting <br/>like crazy
