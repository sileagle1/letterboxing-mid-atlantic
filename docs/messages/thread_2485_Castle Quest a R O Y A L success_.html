Dozens of excellent boxes...  superb clues ..... clever hiding places <br/>
including at least one mechanical engineering marvel...  followed by a <br/>
banquet fit for a King! The attention to detail and planning was <br/>
masterful... and surpassed only by the generous and friendly <br/>
hospitality. You raised the bar another notch, Local gathers will never <br/>
be the same!</div>

<div>Here Here to the Castle Keepers!  The Boxalots had a marvelously medieval time.  I would dare say that we were even pampered at this event!  Every need was thought of - every detail nailed down.  You all did a great job - saying thank you doesn't seem to cut it!  </div>
<div> </div>
<div>And to the other boxers in the realm - it was fantastic meeting you.  Hope we cross paths again some day.</div>

<div>Take care, The Boxalots (and Smart Cookie)</div>

The stamps carved by boxers I knew, and boxers I don't, were fabulous, the whole concept and execution was wonderful and the dinner and awards were just over the top. Castle Keepers must have been up for months and spent a couple of mortgage payments on this one. What a gather! And what fun to meet folks I haven't had a chance to meet yet. A marvelous time.
