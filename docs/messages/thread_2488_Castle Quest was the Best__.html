before me.<br/>
<br/>
I am in awe of all the work and especially the clever plants and box<br/>
formats the CastleKeepers and their charges put out for us.  They did<br/>
a splendid job -- and any time wine is a prize, the applause gets louder.<br/>
<br/>
Those who carved for this gather are also to be applauded - the whole<br/>
theme was just perfect and the location delightful.<br/>
<br/>
And at the end of the meal having finally gotten my rare (spelled raw)<br/>
filet mignon I can stretch out the enjoyment yet another day - steak<br/>
salad, steak sandwich<br/>
<br/>
Thanks also to the Scarlet Knights -- with Sir George and his damsels.<br/>
 Dame Judith (Judith &amp; Sparky) joined us from Atlanta.  Meanwhile a<br/>
couple of RHB'rs rounded out the team . . . which always knows it's place.<br/>
