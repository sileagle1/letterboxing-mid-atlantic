Here is a post Carmen and I placed to the Newboxers list last month. <br/>
He dictated while I typed. He has no preference as to material, he <br/>
likes the speedball pink stuff and the white stuff as well. We just <br/>
placed an order through Dick Blick so he could try some of the grey <br/>
stuff someone was raving about. I hope he likes it 'cause it was <br/>
pretty darn cheap, $1.98 for a 4x4 sheet. We'll let you know. Anyway, <br/>
per you request here is Carvin' Carmen's home grown technique:<br/>

There's always tons of posts on all of the lists about carving <br/>
material and images transfers. I save what sounds like good info and <br/>
review it with my son Carmen, who does all of our carving. He is <br/>
rarely on the trails with me but is still a member of the team. He <br/>
has tried the white stuff, the pink stuff, plumbers gasket, etc. He <br/>
said he can pretty much carve anything and likes the speedball pink <br/>
stuff the best but he said his trick is to carve all of the fine <br/>
detail FIRST, before you cut away large pieces of real estate. He <br/>
said that way the stamp surface is still firm and doesn't move or <br/>
wiggle when trying to carve delicate lines. When done this way you <br/>
can go back and touch and neaten things up because the surface is <br/>
still firm, but if detail is left to the end you must cut it right <br/>
the first time or run the risk of the material wiggling while cutting <br/>
and taking too much material away, destroying fine detail. So he does <br/>
all fine details first, then carves away the excess. And he<br/>
 does it all with an A-type exacto knife, straight pin, speedball kit <br/>
and a magnifying glass. Someday, when I have the time to figure out <br/>
how to use our scanner, I'll post a file with our images. I think <br/>
he's pretty darn good, but remember, I am his Mom!<br/>
<br/>
He has not tried the heat transfer method becuase he uses the pencil <br/>
method but does it perhaps a little differently than some. He tapes a <br/>
piece of tracing paper over his image, even if it's his original <br/>
artwork, which most of our stamps are. He then traces over it in <br/>
pencil. He goes very heavy on the fine detail lines, but only puts <br/>
lines or crosshatches on larger, solid areas. He says the trick is to <br/>
get the only as much lead and only on the areas you need to reduce <br/>
smudging. He then takes the tracing paper and puts it face down on <br/>
the carving material and uses a large paper clip to rub it and <br/>
transfer. Again, he's tried all kinds of stuff but says the large <br/>
rounded end of a paper clip works best for him because it applies a <br/>
lot of pressure per square inch but doesn't tear the tracing paper.He <br/>
goes over each individual line until the tracing paper seems to turn <br/>
white where the lines are and all lead has been transfered. After he <br/>
removes the tracing paper he then inks over top of<br/>
 the lead and lets it dry a bit so it's resistant to smudging when <br/>
carving. That way if the lead smudges, he's still got a clean line to <br/>
follow. After that, he carves all of his fine detail first, then <br/>
finishes the stamp. We mount all of our stamps using rubber cement. <br/>
So far, so good. <br/>
<br/>
So anyway, that's Hikers &amp; Hounds 2 cents. Hope to see everyone at <br/>
the gathering. Carmen will be there so I am very excited. <br/>
