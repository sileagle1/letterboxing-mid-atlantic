staying at an inn that was built by her ancestors in the 1740s, plus a<br/>
visit to LaDew Topiary Gardens, which are really beautiful if you<br/>
happen to like flowers and stuff. This was her weekend, so I left the<br/>
kit at home.<br/>

Sunday morning she asks me "Did you look on the website for any boxes<br/>
around here?"</div>
