<br/>
Mine's the NJ Physiography series. I love it and hate it. What was I <br/>
thinking?<br/>
The initial planting was fun. Carve a map of NJ, cut the stamp into 5 <br/>
pieces, plant 5 boxes all up and down the state. Simple.<br/>
First, box 101 reported missing. More than once. Carve one piece of <br/>
map for replacement box. Go to plant - box NOT missing.<br/>
Next missing report: 101 again, since I have an extra stamp? Nooooo, <br/>
it's 105, chewed up beyond hope. Carve another map piece, replace.<br/>
Next: 103. Carve replacement stamp. Make charming hand-bound book, <br/>
this time, too. Box NOT missing.<br/>
Next: 101 or 103, since I have replacement stamps? 103's book, since <br/>
I have a charming new one? Noooo, it's 104's turn. Carve stamp, slice <br/>
out first page of charming book and stamp second page, replace box. <br/>
Last Saturday - note the day.<br/>
Next: This Tuesday - note the day. 102. Gone. <br/>
AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAARGH!!!!!!!!!!!!!<br/>
<br/>
Thank you.<br/>
We now return to your regularly scheduled civil discussion of dry, <br/>
safe boxes and satisfying finds.<br/>
