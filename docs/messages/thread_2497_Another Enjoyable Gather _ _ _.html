because of helping the kids finish off the school year, couldn't <br/>
stay and camp, but we came just to say hello and enjoy the night <br/>
boxing. <br/>
<br/>
It's always great to see the local usual suspects. Great to see far <br/>
away friends, TDG, and meet new far away boxers, Pioneer Spirit. <br/>
Speaking of which, I ran off with his stamp and log for his <br/>
hitchhiker hostel. I thought it was a HH. I really did. I'll <br/>
probably mail it to him. <br/>
<br/>
Wish we could have stayed longer. Wish we could have got all the <br/>
stamps in the campground. But we got several great stamps, and <br/>
seeing people, made the drive from Virginieyeaye very worthwhile. <br/>

hear of the problems with the authorities people ran into in our neck <br/>
of the woods in Maryland.<br/>
<br/>
I was able to stop by in late morning and early afternoon and briefly <br/>
meet folks, enjoy Pioneer Spirit's HHH, and grab the "SPOB" stamp. Had <br/>
fun chatting with Irene and Mr. Irene and meeting Dude.<br/>
<br/>
A big thanks to everyone who found some of my boxes and especially <br/>
those who went up on the ridge in the Elkridge section of the park and <br/>
found the restored Rockburn Branch series by Energizer Bunnie, Mommo, <br/>
Whisper Foot and me. We are grateful!<br/>
<br/>
Finally, a note to Mr. Irene: I do believe that tree was a Chestnut <br/>
Oak. The leaves check out.<br/>

<br/>
We really had a good night Saturday, despite the park Gestapo.  They <br/>
seemed to hold off after about ten or so.  I think I finally went to bed <br/>
at about 2:30.  I know Green Dragon and KPI were still up.  Boy, were <br/>
they having a ball.<br/>
<br/>
It was great seeing you Southern folk.  Green Dragon, Bulldawg and I had <br/>
a very lively discussion that I really enjoyed.  I kept forcing Scarab <br/>
and Night Owl to stay later and later for just one more stamp.  When KPI <br/>
and I went on a beer run they left Pirate at the site (in the capable <br/>
hands of H&amp;H of course) and he says don't worry, he was going to go play <br/>
with the girls ;-)  Kids are great!<br/>
<br/>
Schizokeet, Sheba and I went for the Blackburn Branch boxes in the <br/>
morning.  They were wonderful, and only Pioneer Spirit had beat us to <br/>
them (that man can get around!), but it was nice that some of the boxes <br/>
had their old logbooks and we got to see some really old signature <br/>
stamps (including an early Scarab).<br/>
<br/>
Schiz and I later went to the Oriole's game, where the team we were <br/>
rooting for, the Rockies (She is the actual fan, I just figure I've got <br/>
to root for the National League team since my beloved Phils are such), <br/>
crushed to O's 6-1.  Camden Yards is a really nice ballpark, and that <br/>
makes it the #5 major league park I have been to.<br/>
<br/>
Sheba and I stopped at Pony Boxer's home on the way back and had <br/>
dinner.  The chicken was excellent.<br/>
<br/>
Another fun weekend, and I am happy the night boxing went over so well <br/>
once again.  I am going to continue to do it here and there, and change <br/>
out stamps each time so folks can get something different each time.  <br/>
Hmmm... Maybe Alienteering?<br/>

 night!.....</div> <div> </div> <div>Enjoyed seeing familiar faces like J &amp; R, Scarab, Tempes Fugit, Geko(and others)....and new ones like Pioneer Spirit, driving 8 hours for this event, and the Mr Yuk crew.  Enjoyed the whole experience, and the breakfast after.  This needs to occur more than once every year, and maybe Ill try hosting one of these this fall if folks are up for it.....</div> <div> </div> <div>Thanks again Hikers....always a sweetheart, and a treasure for this hobby.  Great to meet Mr Irene as well.......he was a trip.<br/><br/><b><i>Hikers and Hounds &lt;hikers_n_hounds@...&gt;</i></b> wrote:</div> <blockquote><span title="qreply"> <blockquote class="ygrps-yiv-473641998replbq" style="PADDING-LEFT:5px;MARGIN-LEFT:5px;BORDER-LEFT:#1010ff 2px solid;"> <div id="ygrps-yiv-473641998ygrp-text"> <div> <div>Ahhhhh, so THAT'S where that went!

make this brief.<br/>
<br/>
I want to thank H&amp;H for a wonderful gather.  The planning and the <br/>
hospitality were betond reproach.<br/>
<br/>
Cyclonic, thanks so much for the night boxing, it was a great course <br/>
and the stamps were spectacular.<br/>
<br/>
MizScarlet, Starry Starry Night is truly a work of art.  I was awed.<br/>
<br/>
Bulldawg, I was unaware of my son's advances.  Looks like he's <br/>
taking after his Dad!  (Go Steelers)<br/>
<br/>
SewSowBizzy, thanks for being a surrogate mom when I had to take a <br/>
trip, and I finally got our PT!<br/>
<br/>
Pioneer Spirit, your boxes hidden in plain site were truly <br/>
spectacular, they gave me some great ideas.<br/>
<br/>
Scarab - MORE SEXY LADIES AND ZOMBIES!<br/>
<br/>
Geckospot, Scizokeet, Mr. Irene, and anyone else I missed: thanks <br/>
for the lively conversation, debates, food, and beer.  It truly is a <br/>
wonderful community we have, and I feel honored to be a part.<br/>
<br/>
And finally Team Green Dragon, thanks so much for the boxing fun, <br/>
the wonderful conversation, and the history of the game.  We look <br/>
forward to continuing a budding friendship.<br/>
<br/>
It's not very often one finds themselves in a hobby with a group of <br/>
people so sharing, wonderful, and delightfully creative.  I truly <br/>
wake up in the morning thankful that you folks and this hobby are in <br/>
my life.<br/>
