So, MissMoon, when you read this call me at home and let me know what<br/>
hours you are available for phone calls -- since you keep a different<br/>
work/sleep schedule than I.  This is just in case I need to reach you<br/>
and your mindspring is still leaking or sprung or whatever its problem is.<br/>
