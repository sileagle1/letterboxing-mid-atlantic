I went no mail on the main list and I don't read the SE list, so I have no<br/>
idea what's up. But I have a letterbox planted in Georgia. Can someone<br/>
please save me an archive search and tell me what mess is going on in<br/>
Georgia? I know that Georgia State Parks are a firm no, so that can't be<br/>
causing much, unless the "no rules" group is agitating to disobey that.<br/>
<br/>
I think we are doing fine in the Mid-Atlantic as far as acceptance from our<br/>
state and local parks. I can't think of a non-federal jurisdiction in<br/>
Virginia that has prohibited letterboxing/geocaching. I'm not sure about the<br/>
other states, but there seem to be plenty of letterboxes in PA and MD.<br/>

really cool boxers. A good relationship with the PADNRC, or none at all<br/>

So evidently GA has all of these crazy rules which Red Bing then posted about boxes having to be clearly marked or signed, etc. Just total madness. And I think it was in GA, or it might have been somewhere else, where there was a post about all boxes being pulled by a certain date, etc. I know when I was in NH Dancin' Feet mentioned a Park Director who got really PO'd about someone just bushwacking there way through a forest and was pulling all boxes and geocaches or at least threatening to. That's the kind of thing that I think will be our biggest challenge as this hobby progresses. <br/><br/><b><i>fleurdelislb &lt;fleurdelislb@...&gt;</i></b> wrote:

</span></blockquote>On the subject of DE boxes, my son and I went looking<br/>
for boxes in the Lighthouse series in Cape Henlopen<br/>
park and came up empty.  I don't know if they are<br/>
really MIA or we just gave up too soon, it was really<br/>
hot.  Iplan to go back next week and give it a try<br/>
again and also revisit some older boxes just to heck<br/>
up on them.<br/>

Subject:  MD-ANNE ARUNDEL CO. BOXES ALERT!!<br/>
Hello Boxers,<br/>
ALL BOXES WILL BE PULLED SOMETIME IN THE NEXT TWO WEEKS!!!!!!!<br/>
Shane "Pathmaker" Odom here, new boxer in the Annapolis MD area. My<br/>
family and I have been stamping in as the "Woodwoses".<br/>
Recently our local newspaper has done an article about boxing in the<br/>
area, nice little article, they talked with both a boxer and Park<br/>
Rangers. Well.....I had a feeling about this, boxing is not the only<br/>
hobby I have and I know that press is not always a good thing. I took<br/>
the ball and ran with it. Called AA Co. Recreation dept. Spoke with<br/>
the rec director, John Marshall. Yes, he had seen the article and no<br/>
he had not heard of Boxing before this article. HOWEVER! They do have<br/>
a policy on GeoCacheing and they plan on implementing the same<br/>
towards Letterboxing. That is,<br/>
ALL BOXES WILL BE PULLED SOMETIME IN THE NEXT TWO WEEKS!!!!!!!<br/>
UNLESS the placers of the boxes come forward and request permission.<br/>
They don't wish to deny boxing but they are serious about getting<br/>
permission and following their policies, i.e. not profanity, or other<br/>
unacceptable content in boxes, boxes must be in non-sensitive areas,<br/>
etc. All things that from what I have seen boxers do anyway, except<br/>
of course, asking for permission. He said it will be easy, it is a<br/>
standard form that they use for Geocacheing and they will just fill<br/>
in the blanks with boxing. I gave him my number, after noteing very<br/>
strongly that I represent no one but myself and am not responsible<br/>
for the currently existing boxes. I told him I would pass on our<br/>
communication and I would try to help adopt any boxes that are not<br/>
permited soon. I hope that someone from the local area who is a more<br/>
regular boxer might come forward on this as well. More articles<br/>
always mean more boxers and more boxes and more issues. I know there<br/>
is a Gathering this wknd and I hope this issue is brought up there. I<br/>
don't have the time or resources to adopt all the boxes in the Co.<br/>
and I sure want to see this hobby continue in our area. Look forward<br/>
to some response, I will list my phone number so local folks who<br/>
might help with this can contact me. I will cross post this to the<br/>
newboxers, and LBNA lists.<br/>
Much Peace and Happy Trails,<br/>

So AA Co. MD is have problems. Easy ones to fix. Before planting in a <br/>
AA Co. Park, ask permission. They will probablly give it to you, and <br/>
the guidelines are simple and easy to follow. <br/>

Just total madness. And I think it was in GA, or it might have been <br/>
somewhere else, where there was a post about all boxes being pulled <br/>
by a certain date, etc. I know when I was in NH Dancin' Feet <br/>
mentioned a Park Director who got really PO'd about someone just <br/>
bushwacking there way through a forest and was pulling all boxes and <br/>
geocaches or at least threatening to. That's the kind of thing that I <br/>
think will be our biggest challenge as this hobby progresses. <br/>

The GA policy can be found in the files section of the yahoo group <br/>
letterbox-southeast. On the main list, in it's text-only version, <br/>
it's post #42610. I'm still marshalling my forces to get the policy <br/>
updated to at least get the definition of letterboxing corrected, and <br/>
at most to get the blessings and cooperation of the GDNR. <br/>
Unfortunately, I've been too busy planning the SE Gathering to work <br/>
on it much the last few weeks.<br/>
