I was hoping Cyclonic would inform us which site he has (if he has) so<br/>
we can cluster.  You can book online and as far as I could see a lot of<br/>
the 'modern' campsite are available for that weekend.  (using the online<br/>
reservation link on the above page.)<br/>
<br/>
Not sure if dogs are allowed on the course/trail planned for this gather<br/>
-- so that may have some impact on the campsites.<br/>

It looks like there are still several sites open that allow pets in loop <br/>

The site for reservations is not working right now so you have to call <br/>
to make a reservation (1-888-727-2757).  I had no problem getting <br/>
through and making the reservation.<br/>
<br/>
The cost is $15 for a weekend night (Fri and Sat) plus $2 per night for <br/>
a pet site.  It is a few dollars more for out of state residents.  The <br/>
neighboring sites are still available.<br/>

maybe we can scoot back on Sunday for a little more boxing.  Who knows; <br/>
we're totally playing it by ear.  Upshot is, we'll only be camping <br/>
Friday night.  And maybe Sunday?  As G.S. said, it will depend on the <br/>
teen situation and the doggie doings.<br/>

&gt; Well I just called for HnH and they indicated we got the last space on<br/>
&gt; C Loop(C-34) which was also so when I tried the online reservation<br/>
&gt; -which got hung up on Irene's password.  <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; HnH will probably be down for Fri Nite and I'll be up Sat AM.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; You can only have ONE TENT per site and ONE CAR - extra parking sort<br/>
&gt; of nearby (not up a long hill like at Patapsco.) and NO ALCOHOL.<br/>

&gt; &gt; OK, I have reserved site C18.  The site is pet friendly.<br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; The site for reservations is not working right now so you have to<br/>
call <br/>
&gt; &gt; to make a reservation (1-888-727-2757).  I had no problem getting <br/>
&gt; &gt; through and making the reservation.<br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; The cost is $15 for a weekend night (Fri and Sat) plus $2 per<br/>
night for <br/>
&gt; &gt; a pet site.  It is a few dollars more for out of state residents.<br/>
 The <br/>
&gt; &gt; neighboring sites are still available.<br/>
