I have doggie pix to post at some point but I did not get a pic of <br/>
Sweetie.  Hopefully Pioneer Spirit can throw one in here.  There's also <br/>
a pic of SSB actually sitting down, buried under the weight of an out <br/>
of control postal and various camp foods.  Seems a bit harsh but if <br/>
that's what it takes to have her sit and relax then so be it!<br/>
<br/>
I had all intentions of going out for a hike Sat. afternoon but was <br/>
immediately parked in my chair, beer in hand, fun folks all around.  <br/>
The night boxing helped clear my head though.<br/>
<br/>
Patapsco Valley SP was beautiful but they are horribly overstaffed.  <br/>
They should send some rangers and gate guards elsewhere.  Otto &amp; I went <br/>
to the Rockburn Branch trail Sunday and guess what...the park police <br/>
are hostile there, too.  No dogs allowed in public areas (like parking <br/>
lots).  They can be on the trails but you have to airlift or smuggle <br/>
them in.  I whined and bullied my way into the area and once we hit the <br/>
trail we had a great hike.  Halfway through it started raining.  We <br/>
could hear the drops hitting the leaves, but the canopy was just thick <br/>
enough that not one drop made it down to us.<br/>
<br/>
Now who carved the geckosplat?<br/>
