gotten a bit out of hand. the way i look at VLB's is when it is <br/>
raining outside and i have nothing else better to do with my time, i <br/>
will go looking for a few of these to solve. of course, i would <br/>
rather be outside looking for a "real" letterbox of course.<br/>
as for anyone that would concider a Vlb to be anythinig but that <br/>
is "nuts!" it isn't a "real" letterbox, and should never be <br/>
concidered to be a part of your PFX count.<br/>
<br/>
i have 39 VLB's. 30 about NH if you wanna learn something.<br/>
after some thinking, i figured, if i was going to do VLB's, it was <br/>
going to be educational. but please don't hate me for playing the <br/>
game.<br/>
<br/>
oh and your not going anywhere. hoe would i ever see the "milk <br/>
monster" again?<br/>

&gt; Not having ventured into that side, I assume that they at least <br/>
carve stamps and upload images somewhere.  I don't have much interest <br/>
in that or postals, but people drawn more to the craft aspect of the <br/>
hobby than to the outdoors, or who can't walk, presumably do.  An <br/>
awful lot of people do sudoku, too.  Not something I'm particularly <br/>
interested in but it seems fairly easy not to participate in it.<br/>
&gt;    <br/>
&gt;   And, if virtual letterboxing attracts the "here today, gone <br/>
tomorrow" crowd, isn't that better for more traditional letterboxing <br/>
in the long run?  (Or are those "famous last words"?)<br/>

Sorry, digressed there a bit...<br/>
<br/>
I am in aggreance with you on this.  What is the point of a virtual <br/>
letterbox?  I guess it is fine if you have no other way to get out there <br/>
and do the real thing, but jeez, what a waste of time.  I would much <br/>
rather spend my time at the computer figuring out real letterboxes (F#*&amp; <br/>
Postage Due) then these things.<br/>
<br/>
So, the lady that planted 1001, I did do one to see what all the hub bub <br/>
was, and all it did was lead me to a picture downloaded from the <br/>
internet.  If that is all it takes to "plant" these things, I could do <br/>
that in my sleep.  It seems that is pretty much what she did, as they <br/>
were all posted within five days.<br/>
<br/>
Oh well, to each their own, but personally I would rather hit the trail, <br/>
with some good friends, on a sunny day, and a good, hard hike ahead of <br/>
me.  To me that is what it is about!<br/>

Pretty lame, IMHO.  They're just puzzles, not LBs.  And Postal LBs <br/>
are really just an arts &amp; crafts ring or exchange, again, not LBs.  <br/>

There used to be a boxer in this area who posted his own version <br/>
of "virtual" letterboxes - he put clues up to get you to a location; <br/>
you were supposed to take a photo and email it to him to get whatever <br/>
he sent back.  Even tho I figured out where a couple of these were, I <br/>
never bothered to collect them.  If I wanted a print out of a stamp, <br/>
I'd just go to google images and download some!  :-D<br/>

&gt; &gt; Not having ventured into that side, I assume that they at least <br/>
&gt; carve stamps and upload images somewhere.  I don't have much <br/>
interest <br/>
&gt; in that or postals, but people drawn more to the craft aspect of <br/>
the <br/>
&gt; hobby than to the outdoors, or who can't walk, presumably do.  An <br/>
&gt; awful lot of people do sudoku, too.  Not something I'm particularly <br/>
&gt; interested in but it seems fairly easy not to participate in it.<br/>
&gt; &gt;    <br/>
&gt; &gt;   And, if virtual letterboxing attracts the "here today, gone <br/>
&gt; tomorrow" crowd, isn't that better for more traditional <br/>
letterboxing <br/>
&gt; in the long run?  (Or are those "famous last words"?)<br/>

&gt; &gt;           Funny you should ask this! On a previous post, I <br/>
&gt; mentioned that I was<br/>
&gt; &gt; considering quitting letterboxing because I don't like a lot of <br/>
the<br/>
&gt; &gt; changes going on. One of the many changes that really bother me <br/>
are<br/>
&gt; &gt; people who "plant" and "find" virtual letterboxes and feel that <br/>
they<br/>
&gt; &gt; are now "real" letterboxers. I am not exactly sure why this is <br/>
even<br/>
&gt; &gt; part of letterboxing but it is very popular among those who don't <br/>
&gt; seem<br/>
&gt; &gt; to want to go outside.<br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; I loved Nathan's signature line "real men don't do virtual<br/>
&gt; &gt; letterboxes" although I might have amended it to say, "real<br/>
&gt; &gt; letterboxers don't do virtual letterboxes."<br/>

&gt; &gt; &gt; What in the %&amp;@(! is a virtual LB? Someone on AQ just posted <br/>
that <br/>
