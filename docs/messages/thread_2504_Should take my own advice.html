<div><font face="Arial" size="2">Did I not just say that the best protection was 
jeans and long sleeves?  I went out yesterday to do some boxing in 
Lancaster with Squirt and Miss P, wearing shorts, with the swim suits in the 
trunk for later.  Figured I knew what poison ivy looks like and if the bugs 
started biting I'd pull out some bug spray, but the trail was paved, so I wasn't 
worried about ticks.  </font></div>
<div><font face="Arial" size="2"></font> </div>
<div><font face="Arial" size="2">EXCEPT we did end up off the paved part and the 
weeds that were sticking out across the path for several feet turned out to be 
stinging nettles!  Not knowing what they were, we waded through them.  
All three got stung and Miss P got it in the face while crawling under a fallen 
tree across the path.</font></div>

    letterboxing<br/>&gt; <br/>&gt; <br/>&gt; <br/>&gt; I finally got a day to 
    letterbox, so I headed out to Bombay Hook <br/>for the Pierre's Vinyl Cut 
    series. I stopped in the vistor's center <br/>to see if the Parson's Point 
    trail was opened and it was. No eaglets <br/>this year. The lady warned me 
    that there were reports of flies. I <br/>thought I was ready because I had 
    brought my 25% deet spray. When I <br/>hit the first trail, I got about 30 
    feet before I could not take the <br/>flies, so I got back to my car, put on 
    a long sleeve shirt and <br/>resprayed myself. I have never seen so may flies 
    they kept getting <br/>between my eyes and glasses but I kept on. I found 2 
    of 3 of the <br/>boxes and really enjoyed the tower on Bear Swamp trail. The 
    breeze <br/>kept the flies away. It was a good thing that there has been so 
    much <br/>discussion about tick removal, as I was covered in deer ticks. So 
    <br/>much for Deet working. I may have to be a cold weather letterboxer, 
    <br/>because I really hate ticks.&amp; nbsp; But it was fun to get out and 
    <br/>box. And towards sunset my husband and I went back out and there was 
    <br/>so much wildlife, it was amazing. That's what I love about 
    <br/>letterboxing, there's always an adventure.<br/>&gt; <br/>&gt; <br/>&gt;
