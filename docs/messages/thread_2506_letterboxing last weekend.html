                    <div id="ygrps-yiv-484105162">Handyman and I, Cannonball from Annapolis, MD went out boxing this last <br/>
Sunday. We eneded up leaving at 9:30 am and headed to Lewes and <br/>
Rehoboth Beach to find some boxes. We are also hosting on of the boxing <br/>
buddies and took him to find his first box(es). We also hit Ocean City <br/>
and found one box there, In all we found 6 boxes including "The <br/>
mariner" and "shiver me timbers" as well as "Anglers shark fishing" in <br/>
Lewes. The finding of the boxes was not without incident though, The <br/>
first box we reached was at the "cannonball house" in Lewes and is in <br/>
a "garden" outside the museum. I am not giving up any info as this is <br/>
all in the posted clues, anyway there was a bird which had fallen from <br/>
his nest, a blujay, and the mother flying overhead visibly distraught, <br/>
Well you can guess what happened while I am wearing a WHITE sweater <br/>
shirt... Handyman thought thise was hilarious, and as we know blujays <br/>
are fond of berries so hence two large purple spots. GREAT! so we <br/>
proceeded to the other two boxes and decided I did not know these <br/>
people anyway... who cares. Who am I kidding this was bird doo... <br/>
anyway had to sneak into Walmart and buy a new shirt for the rest of <br/>
the day. We were two hours from home and I had come to see the beach <br/>
and letterbox. Now I know to take at least a spare shirt. We also <br/>
nabbed, Greyhounds reach the baech and dogfish head in Rehoboth and <br/>
Girls gone wild #1 in Ocean City. After leaving at 8:30 pm to head the <br/>
two and 1/2 hours home we finally arrived after 3 accidents and traffic <br/>
delays at minight. (11:45) We had a great day despite the bird and <br/>
traffic. Thanks to all who planted these. We had a great time.<br/>
