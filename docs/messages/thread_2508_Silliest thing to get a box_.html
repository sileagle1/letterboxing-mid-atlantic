<br/>
While finding "Things to do in the pines" series, we ran into some <br/>
trouble... BUT THAT DIDNT STOP US. NOSIREE!<br/>
<br/>
Box #1 - Attacked by 100s of ticks. Seriously.. every ten feet we <br/>
stopped and picked off at least 4 each.<br/>
<br/>
Box #2 - More ticks, and some living creature guarding the box.. I <br/>
could hear him rustling!<br/>
<br/>
Box #3 - Bridge out.. we waded across 20 feet of 6 inches of cedar <br/>
water! Man were our shoes wet.<br/>
<br/>
Box #4 - No problem! Yay!<br/>
<br/>
Box #5 - Heres the biggie.. the trail was flooded... REALLY FLOODED. <br/>
The pond took it over... I'm talking more than a foot and a half <br/>
deep, for about 500 feet. We went back to the car, got some <br/>
contractor grade garbage bags we had in the trunk and walked to the <br/>
box... potato sack style.. in our garbage bags.. through water up to <br/>
our knees right to the box. The box was on the only spot of dry land <br/>
around the pond! Yay box! <br/>
<br/>
People camping across the lake saw us.. imagine what they were <br/>
thinking.<br/>
<br/>
So .. that got me to thinking.. are other letterboxers as crazy as we <br/>
are when a box presents an unforseen obstacle?</div>

Once, in RI, I was going for a Drew Clan box. My dad and I found<br/>
ourselves on a high narrow cliff - in the middle of waist high poison<br/>
ivy. We didn't find the box, but miraculously neither of got poison ivy!<br/>

<br/>
As for me, well, I'm allergic and grew up without dogs.  I like some <br/>
dogs and I have some favorites in our condo complex, but I've also <br/>
had some really scary experiences - at least twice I nearly wound up <br/>
in fights with Fido.  Even a dog that is normally friendly or happy <br/>
may have an inexplicable problem with a specific person.  <br/>
<br/>
The worst scenario is always a dog without its human nearby.  It's an <br/>
even bigger issue when I am out cycling or running and a dog wants to <br/>
chase.<br/>
<br/>
Agreed with Otis' Friends - it's hard to be scared of a pug - what, <br/>
are you going to sneeze on me?<br/>

&gt; Otis was a pretty agreeable fellow but was always aggressive with <br/>
other dogs when on leash.  Off leash, he would always yield, so I <br/>
much preferred keeping him off leash.  Of course, most people aren't <br/>
afraid of pugs, so that wasn't an issue.<br/>
&gt;   We see dogs on and off leash on the trail every now and then and <br/>
it's not a big deal to us.  Most of them are friendly with kids and <br/>
those who aren't have responsible friends who keep a short leash.<br/>

&gt;             TGD and I had a discussion about this. Being a dog <br/>
owner and lover, I don't USUALLY get panicky when I see a dog running <br/>
towards me. Before Dude lost his hearing I used to let him off leash <br/>
all of the time as he is the gentlest dog I've ever owned, the only <br/>
things he chased were squirrels, geese and deer. And he could never <br/>
actually catch any of them. He loves poking around in the <br/>
woods,sniffing out all of the different scents and exploring <br/>
everything.  But Brian of TGD doesn't have a dog, and mentioned how <br/>
HE deosn't know that a loose dog is friendly, even if the owner says <br/>
so and especially if the owner is nowhere in sight just yet. He <br/>
mentioned how distressing it can be and I really appreciated his <br/>
point of view. So when my sweet boy does eventually pass away and I <br/>
adopt a new friend, I will do a better job leash training them and <br/>
keep them on leash on trail. <br/>
&gt;    <br/>
&gt;   IF I am ever unsure of a dog I just stand still and keep my hands <br/>
folded under my arms and let the dog sniff me and check me out. Look <br/>
at the fur between it's shoulders (hackles) and the tail. Are it's <br/>
hackles up, an indication of stress and agression. Is it wagging it's <br/>
tail? While that is not always an indication of a calm and happy dog, <br/>
in general in an aggressive dog, the tail will usually be erect and <br/>
motionless.  The head will be very high, with ears pressed against <br/>
the head.  The dog's stare is intense, direct and focused.  Teeth may <br/>
be bared if the dog is growling.  <br/>
&gt;    <br/>
&gt;   Anyway, I can appreciate how disconcerting it may be, especially <br/>
with your little onces with you. I have been meaning to get mace or <br/>
bear spray to keep at hand. Might be something to think about, unless <br/>
you think the kids might actually get to it and spray you by mistake!<br/>

<br/>
This happens more often than one would expect - especially on trails<br/>
that clearly state that ALL dogs must be leashed. I guess everybody<br/>
thinks that their dog is special or friendly or not a dog at all.<br/>
<br/>
As soon as I am aware of a dog on the trail, by sound or sight,<br/>
leashed or unleashed, I stop. First I try to identify if an unleashed<br/>
dog is accompanied by an owner and if that is the case I ask the human<br/>
to secure their dog. Most pet owners will comply. If they do not, a<br/>
hint that the park authorities will be contacted will generally get<br/>
them to grudgingly put a leash on the dog while muttering something<br/>
about four flat tires in the parking lot. If an unleashed dog is not<br/>
immediately accompanied and I feel threatened by it, I try to remain<br/>
unnoticed by the animal and will sit down quietly (hopefully<br/>
unobserved) until the dog has moved far enough away that I can<br/>
continue on the path in the opposite direction of said pooch. <br/>
<br/>
We have encountered unleashed, unattended, potentially threatening<br/>
dogs while on the trail with a child and the sitting quietly until the<br/>
dog went away worked for us. I think that this is something that you<br/>
can talk about with your children along the way and prepare them to be<br/>
quiet and try not to attract the dogs attention so that when the<br/>
situation arises, they will be more prepared to follow your "be quiet<br/>
and sit over here for a few minutes".<br/>
<br/>
Don't look a strange dog in the eye.<br/>
<br/>
Hope this helps as it seems that there really are a lot of unleashed<br/>
dogs out on the trails these days.<br/>

                    <div id="ygrps-yiv-1358696520">Thanks everyone for your thoughts/suggestions.  I grew up in the <br/>
country, where the friendly dogs ran free &amp; the "guard" dogs were <br/>
chained/locked up.  In the meantime, I've had some different <br/>
experiences with unleashed dogs that have given me more confidence.  <br/>
But that was before I was holding the toddler &amp; protecting the 4 <br/>
y.o.'s.  <br/>
<br/>
When I heard the dogs, before I could see them (&amp; as I said there <br/>
were 5, so they were fairly noisy), I had both the 4 y.o.s stand <br/>
right next to me facing me &amp; hollered loudly to the out-of-sight <br/>
owners that I had children with me, but knew I was also helping the <br/>
dogs find me faster.  <br/>
<br/>
Lori, I never would have thought to sit down.  Wouldn't this put me <br/>
in a unprotected/unprotectable position with a more aggressive dog?  <br/>
<br/>
I've previously been very cautious selecting parks to take the <br/>
children to, but I will be even more careful in the future.  Thanks <br/>
again, everyone!  <br/>

get bitten by a tick.  They are all part of being outside.  You could <br/>
get chased by dogs, eaten by mosquitoes, attacked by a bear, struck by <br/>
lightning, caught is a sudden downpour, fall off a cliff, hit by a <br/>
falling tree, run over by a rampaging letterboxer out to get that one <br/>
last stamp.  These are all dangers of the woods and even your own nice, <br/>
safe looking local park.  Not to dissuade you too much, but if you are <br/>
worried about these things and more, maybe you shouldn't be out in the <br/>
woods.<br/>

&gt; That is a lot of what ifs.  It is one of those things you just have to <br/>
&gt; deal with.  It is like some recent posts about ticks, and what if you <br/>
&gt; get bitten by a tick.  They are all part of being outside.  You could <br/>
&gt; get chased by dogs, eaten by mosquitoes, attacked by a bear, struck by <br/>
&gt; lightning, caught is a sudden downpour, fall off a cliff, hit by a <br/>
&gt; falling tree, run over by a rampaging letterboxer out to get that one <br/>
&gt; last stamp.  These are all dangers of the woods and even your own <br/>
&gt; nice, safe looking local park.  Not to dissuade you too much, but if <br/>
&gt; you are worried about these things and more, maybe you shouldn't be <br/>
&gt; out in the woods.<br/>

                    <div id="ygrps-yiv-199741481">Oh, dogs.  Today was not a good day for me and dogs.  I've never been afraid <br/>
of them before, but now I'm sure I'm going to jump a little if I see one <br/>
running toward me.<br/>
<br/>
I got a summer job at a state park here in CT.  We allow dogs here, on <br/>
leashes.  A woman came in at about 8:07. I'll call her Early Lady. She had a sweet <br/>
smiling stocky dog in the back seat of her car. I took her cash and said, "Oh, <br/>
hi, puppy! Are you going for a walk today?" The dog got all happy. Cute.<br/>
<br/>
About 45 minutes later, a woman I'll call Crazy Lady came in. She told me <br/>
that she had four dogs in the back of her van, and that she was going to <br/>
mountainbike with them. I told her that dogs are welcome, as long as they're on a <br/>
leash. She told me she was going to take them two at a time, and she needed to <br/>
park in the shade, she was just going to park "over there." I said, "Well, <br/>
there's no parking right there." She drove over there anyway, so I stepped out of my <br/>
booth to tell her that she couldn't leave her van there. She said that she <br/>
would just park in the handicapped space, and I said no, she wasn't handicapped. <br/>
As we were arguing (she was probably 10 feet away from me), Early Lady <br/>
approached me with her cute little dog on a leash.<br/>
<br/>
She said, "What's that lady's problem?" I said, "She's just trying to figure <br/>
out where to park, I guess."<br/>
<br/>
And then it happened so fast that it didn't register at first.<br/>
<br/>
She said, "Oh, my God! Did my dog just bite you?"<br/>
<br/>
I said, "No, I didn't feel--- OH MY GOD!" OK, it took a moment for the pain <br/>
to register. Holy explative.  It hurt. It was a very hot red pain. It was more <br/>
like a burn than anything else.<br/>
<br/>
Crazy Lady came running over and started chastising Early Lady for letting <br/>
her dog bite me. I went into my booth and shut the bottom half of the door. My <br/>
uniform shirt is very long, so I just pulled down my pants enough to see it <br/>
(right above my knee) and it was UGLY. And it hurt even more.<br/>
<br/>
Early Lady put her dog in her car and flagged down the teenagers who work at <br/>
the park, who were driving around in the golf cart. They brought me an ice <br/>
pack and I called (my supervisor) Mr. Ranger, who was at another park. Mr. Ranger <br/>
said that he couldn't tell me what to do, but he advised me to get to a <br/>
doctor. Early Lady drove me, even though I said that I could drive myself.<br/>
<br/>
They gave me a tetanus shot and I got to take a good look at the bite. It's a <br/>
diagonal VERY swollen area of about six inches from the top puncture to the <br/>
bottom. Right now it's all kinds of pretty colors. I might post a photo if <br/>
anyone wants to be grossed out. ;) He put some peroxide and bacitracin (sp?) on it <br/>
and bandaged me up and gave me a prescription for antibiotics. One of the DEP <br/>
(Department of Environmental Protection... they run the parks and forests) <br/>
cops (I bet you didn't know they have their own police force) came to check on <br/>
me and take my statement.<br/>
<br/>
Early Lady drove me to the pharmacy to fill the prescription, paid my $3 <br/>
copay and brought me back to the park.<br/>
<br/>
After I got back, I called Mr. Ranger, who came by to take his own statement. <br/>
I'm going to call Early Lady's vet in a few (I have all her information) to <br/>
find out if the dog is really up to date on rabies vaccinations. I didn't mind <br/>
the tetanus shot, but the rabies shots are going to be an explitive if I need <br/>
them.<br/>
<br/>
She told me that she may have the dog put down over this, and I got really <br/>
upset. I mean, doesn't every dog bite someone once in a while? No? I don't know. <br/>
I've never owned one.<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, yeah. Animal Control is going to call her and probably quarantine her <br/>
dog for 10 days. I'm going to soak my wound for 15 minutes a day and take <br/>
antibiotics for 10 days.<br/>
<br/>
She told me that the dog had never done this before, but that she's feeling <br/>
old and out of sorts and stressed, and maybe that's why?  I don't know.  I just <br/>
can't believe it happened.  OW.  Owie, owie, ow.<br/>
<br/>
Don't tell your daughter this story.  ;)<br/>
