<br/>
Team Lightnin' Bug is back in the house.  Tom and I just spent 3 days <br/>
camping at Akelaland (Cub Scout camp in Jonas, PA).  We had a <br/>
wonderful time and hit the newly restored Jacobsburg SP series.  We <br/>
enjoyed hunting these boxes and the visit was well worth the effort.  <br/>
for those of you naturalistically inclined, the trails take you <br/>
through some of the largest Hemlocks I have ever seen, along a very <br/>
nice stream, a couple of good climbs along the Bushkill Creek ("try <br/>
not to look down to much Thomas!" "OK Daddy, but I still glimpse), <br/>
and finally through some beautiful purple Monarda.  This was about <br/>
Tom's 10 am limit.<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, we'd like to thank Silent Doug and Jennifer for restoring <br/>
these 'pioneer' boxes.<br/>
<br/>
One final thing, when compared to Jacobsburg SP, what is the <br/>
difficulty of the 3 Fall Series (Factory, Deer, etc.)?  We'll be <br/>
passing through there on the way to the family vacation spot and Mrs. <br/>
Lightnin' Bug and a younger, less stable kid will be coming along.  <br/>
Tom and I want to seek and find, but we want to be sure Mommy and <br/>
little guy will be able to do it.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks again,<br/>
<br/>

</span></blockquote>I'd say that they're very comparable in terms of distance and difficulty. <br/>
Some of the walkways and trails along the waterfalls will require keeping a <br/>
close eye on the kids. Plus, the waterfalls themselves are real pleasure, <br/>
so if after the first two boxes they want to hang back and enjoy them, it <br/>
would be easy enough for you two to meet them back at the falls after the <br/>
third.<br/>
