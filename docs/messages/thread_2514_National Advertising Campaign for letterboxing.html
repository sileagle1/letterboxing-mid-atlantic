<div>From interviews with small magazines with limited readers, interviews with bigger publications and more readers will grow. That's the whole point of not starting it in the first place. Once the ball starts rolling down the hill you can't stop it. </div>

not enough information if someone wanted to start boxing and that <br/>

have done articles in the past that have ALOT more information.  I <br/>
also wondered if Chevy had gotten permission (Geocaching has some <br/>

What dismay's me is that Disney owns Family Fun and keeps bringing <br/>
attention to the sports-- yet where are the sanctioned letterboxes <br/>

deal.......", one wonders just who goes out and gets this deal, and who<br/>
benefits from it. And how do they benefit from it?  Neither Geocaching nor<br/>
letterboxing is an organized club or "business".  ( I mean I know<br/>
letterboxing isn't.....am I wrong about geocaching?) So who would Chevy<br/>
have gotten permission :::from:::? Or would they need permission? Why would<br/>
they need permission? There's no copyright or patent on letterboxing,<br/>
right?  And once someone puts their box clues online they are in esssence<br/>
public property I think. I'm no lawyer, but no one owns letterboxing, so<br/>
what permission would be needed? Anyone can just jump in a get a "deal"<br/>
with anyone. This sucks, but I don't see how it can be avoided. <br/>
<br/>
Out of curiosity I googled "Letterboxing Camp" and came up with freaking<br/>
tons of stuff. And as it as been pointed out to me on more than one<br/>
occassion, the horse is already out of the barn. But I'm still pissed and<br/>
will remain pissed. <br/>

missmoon......certainly not letting it ruin her trip to the gathering in<br/>
Alaska and some pretty stunning scenery to box in!! 11:49 am tomorrow<br/>
morning I will be winging my way to the far north, followed shortly<br/>
afterward by Sewsowbizzy!! Box on people, box on! <br/>

&gt;<br/>
&gt; Well, I opened my copy of the family fun and actually thought it was <br/>
&gt; not enough information if someone wanted to start boxing and that <br/>
&gt; they would have to hit the web sites for more than just clues.  They <br/>
&gt; have done articles in the past that have ALOT more information.  I <br/>
&gt; also wondered if Chevy had gotten permission (Geocaching has some <br/>
&gt; kind of deal with Jeep-- each year,  Jeep put out "jeep" hitchikers <br/>
&gt; and someone wins a Jeep)<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; What dismay's me is that Disney owns Family Fun and keeps bringing <br/>
&gt; attention to the sports-- yet where are the sanctioned letterboxes <br/>
&gt; and geocaches in their parks/resorts/etc.?????<br/>

taken straight from their website unless indicated by IMO)...<br/>
<br/>
Yes,  Geocaching's website is actually run by Grondspeak which is a <br/>
company with paid employees and over 100 volunteers.    The three <br/>
head honchos were the ones who placed/found some of the first boxes, <br/>
did the first website, and/or came up with the geocaching name.<br/>
<br/>
With Jeep,  they release 5000 Jeep travel bugs each year.  Once you <br/>
find one,  you register and your name gets entered to win a Jeep.  <br/>
They also have "diabetes" travel bugs and a bunch of other "travel <br/>
bugs" from misc events, causes, etc.  Anyone can develop a bug.<br/>
<br/>
So yes,  with Geocaching,  there is Groundspeak sanctioned <br/>
advertising that they get paid for.  The website has advertsing.  So <br/>
when the Jeep bugs get released in August,  the advertising will be <br/>
everywhere.  On the website, in magazines, etc.<br/>
<br/>
BUT, Geocaching also has over 416000 caches worldwide (from 0 in <br/>
April 2000).  In the last week,  there were 279617 logs by 42013 log <br/>
holders.  And when you look at numbers like that, IMO,  Geocaching <br/>
is totally out of the bag and they need the rules and structure to <br/>
be able to handle that level of interest.<br/>
<br/>
IMO, I think that there are pluses and minues to each group.  But <br/>
the fact that letterboxing touts itself as unorganized is why <br/>
letterboxing can be "taken advantage" of in this way.  And I don't <br/>
mean that to upset anyone,  but it is one of the downsides of being <br/>
a "hobby" where you try to keep it like it always has been.<br/>

&gt; When you (or anyone in general) says "Geocaching has some kind of a<br/>
&gt; deal.......", one wonders just who goes out and gets this deal, <br/>
and who<br/>
&gt; benefits from it. And how do they benefit from it?  Neither <br/>
Geocaching nor<br/>
&gt; letterboxing is an organized club or "business".  ( I mean I know<br/>
&gt; letterboxing isn't.....am I wrong about geocaching?) So who would <br/>
Chevy<br/>
&gt; have gotten permission :::from:::? Or would they need permission? <br/>
Why would<br/>
&gt; they need permission? There's no copyright or patent on <br/>
letterboxing,<br/>
&gt; right?  And once someone puts their box clues online they are in <br/>
esssence<br/>
&gt; public property I think. I'm no lawyer, but no one owns <br/>
letterboxing, so<br/>
&gt; what permission would be needed? Anyone can just jump in a get <br/>
a "deal"<br/>
&gt; with anyone. This sucks, but I don't see how it can be avoided. <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Out of curiosity I googled "Letterboxing Camp" and came up with <br/>
freaking<br/>
&gt; tons of stuff. And as it as been pointed out to me on more than one<br/>
&gt; occassion, the horse is already out of the barn. But I'm still <br/>
pissed and<br/>
&gt; will remain pissed. <br/>

letterboxing<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; Well, I opened my copy of the family fun and actually thought it <br/>
was <br/>
&gt; &gt; not enough information if someone wanted to start boxing and <br/>
that <br/>
&gt; &gt; they would have to hit the web sites for more than just clues.  <br/>
They <br/>
&gt; &gt; have done articles in the past that have ALOT more information.  <br/>
I <br/>
&gt; &gt; also wondered if Chevy had gotten permission (Geocaching has <br/>
some <br/>
&gt; &gt; kind of deal with Jeep-- each year,  Jeep put out "jeep" <br/>
hitchikers <br/>
&gt; &gt; and someone wins a Jeep)<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; What dismay's me is that Disney owns Family Fun and keeps <br/>
bringing <br/>
&gt; &gt; attention to the sports-- yet where are the sanctioned <br/>
letterboxes <br/>
&gt; &gt; and geocaches in their parks/resorts/etc.?????<br/>

She had a few questions for me and then I stayed to teach the kids how <br/>

Today I broke my new Suburban's off-road cherry by taking it down past <br/>
Museum Road at Cheesequake, with JerseyTrailBlazer in tow. He had found <br/>
a missing Martian Maggot letterbox, a year after I had searched <br/>
endlessly. He said, are we allowed to go down this road, the sign <br/>
says "road ends"? and I said, that's why they call it "off-roading!"<br/>
Then I had to go through the car-wash before Sun2Moon could see what we <br/>
had done to it. Now I think I'm equipped to tackle that MapSurfer box <br/>
down in deepest New Jersey..."<br/>

...I have been off the LBNA boards for a couple weeks and I come back <br/>
to find my pal Rick giving me a "dig"  :-)  First off, the sign <br/>
said "road closed" not 'road ends'....and since I saw a park ranger <br/>
there they day before, I only questioned it as I did not want to see my <br/>
pal get a ticket.  ...That being said...I should have called them to <br/>
tell them to come &amp; get you!  LOL.  But it was a good time - that's for <br/>
sure....glad I could help you find that box......  Hee hee  -John</div>
