getting to be a participant in another Letterboxing Pub Crawl!!! <br/>
Putting on an event like this is a huge amount of work. I spent four <br/>
months getting Skullduggery ready and still needed Sewsowbizzy to <br/>
carve stamps the night before (Thank you again!) Our BullDawg has <br/>
been scheming and making trips to Old Town Alexandria for seven <br/>
months... and if any of you have hunted his letterboxes you know the <br/>
the degree of thought and effort he puts into them  (the guy's AQ <br/>
alias nickname is "Psycho"!)... so I am so very psyched about being <br/>
in this, his first event . . . that I will bet a mortgage payment <br/>
this will be absolutely hysterical ( typical BullDawg <br/>
style ! ) . . .and there is no place better for a Pub Crawl then my <br/>
very own hometown : Old Towne Alexandria. Please allow me to <br/>
apologize in advance for anything I might say or do in the excitement!<br/>
Yeehaw... can't wait till Saturday!<br/>

(I don't have a clue what he is talking about with my "ropas <br/>

I used to stress about my gathers a lot, to the point where I didn't enjoy myself at all! But I have attended many and realized that each gather, no matter hbow big or small is special. I really mean that. Letterboxers are some of the best folks on the planet I always enjoy my time spent with them. I have been awed and bowled over and oh-so-appreciative of the larger, themed gathers. And I just love the smaller more intimate gathers. So no matter what, people will enjoy themselves. I love Abe Lincolns saying "I believe people are about as happy as they make up their minds to be". If someone comes to a gather expecting to have fun, they will create their own self-fulfilling prophesy.</div> <div> </div> <div>So don't sweat the small stuff, try and ejoy yourself if you can! I can't wait and plan to kick everyone's butt, literally or
 figuratively.</div> <div> </div> <div>H&amp;H<br/><br/><b><i>BullDawg &lt;bulldawgva@...&gt;</i></b> wrote:</div> <blockquote><span title="qreply"> <blockquote class="ygrps-yiv-171806570replbq" style="PADDING-LEFT:5px;MARGIN-LEFT:5px;BORDER-LEFT:#1010ff 2px solid;"> <div id="ygrps-yiv-171806570ygrp-text"> <div> <div>...oddly I am worried about pleasing the masses.  I was so sure that this was gonna be awesme, but like with anything you always second guess yourself near crunch time.  </div></div></div> <div style="CLEAR:both;FONT-SIZE:1px;COLOR:#fff;">.</div><img height="1" src="http://geo.yahoo.com/serv?s=97359714/grpId=12213842/grpspId=1705065786/msgId=13546/stime=1182298083/nc1=4430620/nc2=4507179/nc3=3848530" width="1"/> <br/><span style="COLOR:white;"></span> </blockquote><br/><p>
