                    <div id="ygrps-yiv-1224183284">Hello all,<br/>
Papa Woodwoose from MD here. I wanted to write a quick comment just <br/>
to share how much I am enjoying this little hobby that some folks on <br/>
here seem to have, (IMHO) worked hard to support in the past years. <br/>
Tonight I am binding a small journal for the first time. Made with <br/>
blank index cards, end papers, board covers, and a sewn binding. I <br/>
have learned several interesting and enjoyable handcrafts since I <br/>
took up boxing just this summer. Not a rarity, as my wife and I are <br/>
full time handcrafters, making sculptural leather masks, and other <br/>
artwork, at Renaissance Fairs and other festivals. But boxing has <br/>
been esp. sweet in the lovely areas it has lead. I tend to pick up <br/>
something and figure it out. Boxing has got me carving stamps, and re-<br/>
exploring my graphic libraries. I brings me back to stencils and <br/>
their applications in studios. I have learned more about <br/>
blockprinting and linoleum(sp?) carving. The speedball nibs are a <br/>
wonderful carving tool that I wish I had know about a couple of years <br/>
ago. And now this little book-making bug has bit me. I am taking the <br/>
covers off all my hardbacks and looking at what method the spine is <br/>
made! And driving my lovely partner a bit crazy in the process.I have <br/>
always loved books, understood much about how they are made, but <br/>
never made one myself. I love handcrafted things of all kinds, and <br/>
all things are handcrafted at some point. It all started with an <br/>
artisan somewhere. So thank you to all the boxers who have supported <br/>
this and thanks to all the boxers yet to come who will send it down <br/>
the years. <br/>
Much peace,<br/>
Make treasures,<br/>

</span></blockquote>Thanks for the kind comments from the both of you. However I should <br/>
warn ya. The book binding will have to wait until MD Ren Faire is <br/>
over. Two business and 6 working faeries means Papa got no time for <br/>
hobbies starting......NOW!...until sometime November. After all, <br/>
being a maskmaker it at over till the Fat Halloween Pumpkin sings!<br/>
And then there is the fact of how little time I have in the first <br/>
place. All the stamps I have carved so far, I have done in huge <br/>
hurry, and I have stated afterwards, "I know I am a better artist <br/>
then this...", and my family has agreed. Someday I get the time to do <br/>
a knock out box, by right now I put out some little cardstock <br/>
journals with staples. I do plan on doing what ya could call <br/>
a "personal traveller" for our booth at MD, if ya could call it that. <br/>
I hope any boxers coming to the faire will pay a visit. <br/>
So in cunclusion, Don't Get Ya Hopes Up right now! Oh boy,,,,,,,got a <br/>
make the mask,,,,,,,,gotta make the bubblewands,,,,,gotta make the <br/>
masks,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,sleep when I die,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,<br/>
