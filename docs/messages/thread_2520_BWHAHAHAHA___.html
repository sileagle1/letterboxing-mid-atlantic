Well, the elusive Red Hat box in Archbald Pothole State Park is no <br/>
longer elusive.  Pink Panther and I were in the on Saturday and she came <br/>
up with it in ten minutes.  It works well when you have the right tools, <br/>
namely a woman to think like how a woman might hide a box.  Kinda like <br/>
if you study while drunk you should take the test while drunk.<br/>
<br/>
Amazingly, that was not the only box we found with little or no clues <br/>
this weekend.  We managed to find Golden Goddess, a Lock Wench creation <br/>
with little more then a recollection of the clue, and two Crayola Posse <br/>
boxes with no clues at all.<br/>
