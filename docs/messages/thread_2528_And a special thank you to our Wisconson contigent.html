room in the box for Red as I recall. Sounds to me that you and Dude's <br/>
mistress have some fence-mending to do!<br/>
<br/>
And while I am on line, A HUGE kudos to Bulldawg and Shell for an <br/>
incredible experience not ever to be forgotten. We thank you so very <br/>
much for the hospitality as well as the sheer audacity and ingenuity in <br/>
the clues. Amazing ideas!<br/>
<br/>
We would also like to thank the the members of Team Skulldungery <br/>
Tankers for an incredible display of virtuoso boxing. We have been <br/>
doing this for a few years but we find we always have something to <br/>
learn. Special thanks to leader Gallant Rogue, who is a gentleman and a <br/>
scholar.<br/>
<br/>
And lastly, to all the other Summer Slam participants. Some new faces, <br/>
some old friends, but boxing remains a great way to connect with the <br/>
best people in the world.<br/>
<br/>
Best regards to all,<br/>
