actually) Coney Island Mermaid Parade.<br/>
<br/>
I almost did not go up, but I talked to Sheba in the middle of the week <br/>
and asked what she was up to over the weekend and she said she had <br/>
Saturday off so I asked if she would like to go and much to my surprise <br/>
and delight she said sure.  As it turned out this would be a day full of <br/>
surprises.<br/>
<br/>
We left early and headed up on the train.  I had actually researched the <br/>
letterboxes in the city so we had all sorts to go after.  Contacting <br/>
Crayola Posse earlier in the week, I asked for suggestions and if maybe <br/>
we could get Ravenboy's exchange.  Ravenboy is a ballerina at The Met <br/>
and I had hoped we could meet up at some point.  As it turned out, <br/>
Crayola Posse were going to be in the city, taking in the play the <br/>
Friday night, and they would all be happy to join us as we roamed the city.<br/>
<br/>
We were a little later then expected, and headed for Peggy's Park <br/>
first.  We were to meet Crayola Posse here, though when we entered the <br/>
park we did not see them, so we found the box and very slyly retrieved it.<br/>
<br/>
"Damn, we were seen."<br/>
<br/>
"What do you mean?"<br/>
<br/>
"Look," and I pointed behind us, and there was Crayola Posse seated on a <br/>
bench.<br/>
<br/>
It was great to finally meet "The Boy" after hearing so much about him.  <br/>
He is a good kid, and I was very impressed by him.<br/>
<br/>
We headed up to Union Square and found Halloween Adventure before <br/>
hopping on the subway for Central park.  After many visits to the city I <br/>
am still amazed by the size, scope and variety of it.  It is just <br/>
massive, and when you emerge from the subway it takes a minute just to <br/>
get your bearings and figure out just where you are.<br/>
<br/>
Another amazing thing is that even with a million other people about no <br/>
one notices what you are doing, or at least cares.  Sheba and I sat down <br/>
right next to imagine, retrieved it, stamped in, and returned it and no <br/>
one knew it.  There is always talk of stealth and being careful that <br/>
others do not see you, and to an extent that is very true, but I have <br/>
found that people will look at you and see right through you.<br/>
<br/>
So we picked up Spook Central and Imagine.  Ravenboy had already left <br/>
for the theatre, and True Indigo and RBGisMe had to head out to, so we <br/>
parted ways and Sheba and I headed for Coney.<br/>
<br/>
The Mermaid Parade is something that has to be seen to truly explain <br/>
what it is.  I can not do it justice in any explanation.  It is <br/>
described as an "art parade."  What the art is, I don't know, but it is <br/>
a celebration of everything that is Coney.<br/>
<br/>
Coney is on the verge of massive change, change that I personally think <br/>
has to come, though many disagree.  Much of the property has been bought <br/>
by several investment firms for redevelopment.  They want to put a <br/>
combined residential and entertainment complex there.  While I have my <br/>
apprehensions about this redevelopment, if it is done as planned it may <br/>
bring Coney back to the days when it was THE place to be in the summer <br/>
before the Disneys.  We will see, but enough of my prattling on.<br/>
<br/>
Coney was packed, wall to wall people, and we were there late.  we <br/>
finally found a spot where we could get a taste of the parade, and I <br/>
managed to actually get a few pictures too.  Sheba loved it, and next <br/>
year would like to return in costume herself.<br/>
<br/>
We went and checked on my Coney Island Mermaid.  I had gotten a report <br/>
from someone who had already found it that it was missing, so I expected <br/>
the worst and carved a new one.  As it turned out it was not missing and <br/>
was right as it should be, very well hidden and dry.  I replaced the bag <br/>
and placed it back while about twenty people were right there with no <br/>
problem.<br/>
<br/>
We went to get something to eat.  I had been trying to get my friend <br/>
Danielle on the phone with no luck, all the lines were clogged, so we <br/>
figured we would get Deno's Thrills and then head back into the city.  <br/>
As it would happen, Danielle and a few of her friends from the Polar <br/>
Bears got in line right behind us.<br/>
<br/>
It was great to see Danielle again.  She is simply a wonderful person.  <br/>
We ate, and Sheba and I found Deno's while Danielle and her friend Laura <br/>
headed to the car to change.  Laura offered us a ride back into town, <br/>
which we gladly took.  Laura is a neat girl.  She has these wonderful <br/>
tattoos all over, colorful and some great images.<br/>
<br/>
We got back into town and headed uptown to find Fog, a box we wanted to <br/>
get earlier but did not because we were running late.  Fog is hidden in <br/>
a tiny little park overlooking the East River, and it has a fantastic <br/>
stamp to boot.<br/>
<br/>
This, however, was not the end of the day.  As we were walking towards <br/>
Penn Station we decided to divert and visit Grand Central.  I had never <br/>
been there, and it is really a remarkable structure.  The space is <br/>
amazing in its scale and grandeur.  We shuttled over to Times Square <br/>
then and walked down to Penn from that point.  We got to the station and <br/>
stepped on the train just as it was about to leave.<br/>
