<br/>
Her Ladyship had a lovely time. Your party planning skills are rivaled<br/>
only by your ability to construct interesting and entertaining<br/>
puzzles. And wonderful job on the weather too, you must tell her<br/>
Ladyship how you arranged that.<br/>
<br/>
Those of you who have not attended a letterboxing pub crawl don't know<br/>
what your missing. Nothing could be more civilized than strolling<br/>
through a quaint village, finding a letterbox and having a cocktail.<br/>
Utterly delightful.<br/>

stamps, and a fun tour of Alexandria. <br/>
<br/>
This pub crawl gather concept shows that you can have a great time with <br/>
urban boxing for a day, even though you couldn't expect those stamps to <br/>
last very long in the wild. How great it is to combine indoor, outdoor, <br/>
and everywhere. <br/>
<br/>
Notable highlights: <br/>
- Beautiful weather. <br/>
- Meeting over brunch before start on a comfortable patio. Beer, food, <br/>
exchanges, cooties, homages, talk, reunions, galore. Adventure Seekers <br/>
appeared with new baby, even though they couldn't stay. First chance to <br/>
see them since they moved to Nern VA. <br/>
- Fascinating binder of clues, photos, info, and more. Mysterious <br/>
envelopes, hidden clues, fun jokes. Great planning. The 'one official <br/>
log book per team" idea really worked great. <br/>
- Non linear route. Teams went off in every direction. <br/>
- Fun encountering other teams on the trail, but seldom being in the <br/>
same place at the same time. <br/>
- Outside boxes too, even in parks. The former railroad tunnel was <br/>
awesome. <br/>
- Founder's Park -- "Make sure they don't see us find the box." Except <br/>
that they had already found it right under our noses, and we never did. <br/>
Well done! I now know every Lone Tree Root to be found within 150 <br/>
yards. <br/>
- Team Work, Team Work -- Multiple people put muliple pieces together <br/>
to find one answer. Some clues had that many pieces to the puzzle, <br/>
which made them really interesting. <br/>
- Such Variety of Clues -- directions, ciphers, observation, gadgets, <br/>
maps, history. Brilliant. <br/>
- And Great stamps!<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for all the fun, <br/>

</span></blockquote>Shirley you don't think nothing went wrong?! <br/>
<br/>
How about the martini I ordered that was served in a tumbler? <br/>
Shudders. And I didn't even get to drink it because I left something <br/>
at the previous place and had to go look for it. <br/>
<br/>
How about one team desperately trying to figure out a combination on <br/>
a chest, not knowing that the pub stamp inside was actually outside <br/>
in the alley with another team stamping in in the dark on an A/C <br/>
unit?? <br/>
<br/>
How about that Both Lori and Night Owl didn't believe they were <br/>
supposed to flash the bartender for the next clue?! Now that was a <br/>
tragedy! (Where's Miz Harlot when you need her?) <br/>
<br/>
How about being caught stamping "Turn Green Draggin'" into Team <br/>
Green Dragon's log by TDG?! <br/>
<br/>
How about that between 'the tunnel', 'oh oh oh', and 'lone roots' I <br/>
stuck my hand in so many nasty, deep holes, I used up a bottle of <br/>
hand sanitizer??? <br/>
<br/>
How about that it isn't a real boxing journey unless Dead Duck Chuck <br/>
draws blood????? The dung beetle did too. <br/>
<br/>
How about searching all over a dang park, through roots, rocks, and <br/>
water, only to learn that necessary clues were at another location <br/>
on the opposite side of town?? Thus hiking all the way across town <br/>
and back?????? Evil, dastardly! (Never mind the subtle clue that <br/>
implied go to the other place first.)  <br/>
<br/>
How about twice trying to look up a Personal Traveler clue only to <br/>
be interrupted by good food, drink, and company??????? I never did <br/>
get that one. Dang. Next time, Gargoyle Bob. <br/>

of an old elementary school with about 40 teenagers<br/>
somewhere in the wilds of western PA. There was only<br/>
one box in town and it had a comercial stamp. Did you<br/>
say martini? The trip was with a church youth group so<br/>
absolutely no alcohol! Looking forward to the<br/>
Pensyltuckey stager. Hey Irene time for some research!<br/>

(Where's Miz Harlot when you need her?) <br/>&gt; &gt; <br/>&gt; &gt; How about being caught stamping "Turn Green<br/>&gt; &gt; Draggin'" into Team
 <br/>&gt; &gt; Green Dragon's log by TDG?! <br/>&gt; &gt; <br/>&gt; &gt; How about that between 'the tunnel', 'oh oh oh', and<br/>&gt; &gt; 'lone roots' I <br/>&gt; &gt; stuck my hand in so many nasty, deep holes, I used<br/>&gt; &gt; up a bottle of <br/>&gt; &gt; hand sanitizer??? <br/>&gt; &gt; <br/>&gt; &gt; How about that it isn't a real boxing journey unless<br/>&gt; &gt; Dead Duck Chuck <br/>&gt; &gt; draws blood????? The dung beetle did too. <br/>&gt; &gt; <br/>&gt; &gt; How about searching all over a dang park, through<br/>&gt; &gt; roots, rocks, and <br/>&gt; &gt; water, only to learn that necessary clues were at<br/>&gt; &gt; another location <br/>&gt; &gt; on the opposite side of town?? Thus hiking all the<br/>&gt; &gt; way across town <br/>&gt; &gt; and back?????? Evil, dastardly! (Never mind the<br/>&gt; &gt; subtle clue that <br/>&gt; &gt; implied go to the other place first.) <br/>&gt; &gt; <br/>&gt; &gt; How about twice trying to look up a Personal<br/>&gt; &gt; Traveler clue only
 to <br/>&gt; &gt; be interrupted by good food, drink, and<br/>&gt; &gt; company????? ?? I never did <br/>&gt; &gt; get that one. Dang.

Her Ladyship is involved with an organization that holds an annual<br/>
retreat. The main entertainment at this retreat is a "No Talent Show"<br/>
which began very humbly but which was immensely entertaining. For a<br/>
few years it got better and better each year, then sort of slumped at<br/>
which point her Ladyship was tapped to host (actually she flat out<br/>
asked). Needless to say, her Ladyship decided to raise the bar a<br/>
little. More lavish costumes, more elaborate set, higher production<br/>
values, etc. Her Ladyship continued to contribute to the enthusiasm to<br/>
raise the bar and it continued to be raised. Every time some new<br/>
extravagance was added it became expected the next year. The show now<br/>
involves construction of a full professional stage including wings and<br/>
an overhead super-structure for professional lighting a professional<br/>
sound system, wireless mics, set decoration, hours and hours of<br/>
planning, setup and money; lots of money. Yes the show is fabulous and<br/>
yes it's the most anticipated event of the year for our little group<br/>
but it's seriously in danger of collapsing under it's own weight. It<br/>
very nearly ended one year ago when the hostess wasn't up to the task<br/>
and failed to do any of the planning and prep work. The show was a<br/>
fiasco partly because of her failings and partly because of events<br/>
beyond her control but the progression to greater and greater heights<br/>
cannot be sustained and I'm now in fear of the monster I helped create. <br/>
<br/>
I would urge you all to seriously consider the notion of a progression<br/>
in the pub crawl tradition toward bigger and bigger and better and<br/>
better or the whole thing could come crashing down in a blaze<br/>
disappointment, regret and resentment. It very nearly did in our "No<br/>
Talent Show" tradition. Let each person make it their own and keep it<br/>
special; meaning, I would urge you to try to keep it to once a year.<br/>
There's a reason Santa only comes once a year...<br/>
<br/>
For Her Ladyship the pub-crawl has become a wonderfully fun way to<br/>
letterbox and meet others. It would be a tragedy to see it get out of<br/>
hand. Look at letterboxing in general everyone's enthusiasm for the<br/>
hobby makes them want to make it bigger and better but in her<br/>
Ladyship's opinion it has now gotten so big it's unmanageable to the<br/>
point where we now have factions, splinter groups, play-my-way-or-not-<br/>
at-all secret groups etc.<br/>
<br/>
I urge everyone to keep a long-term perspective, keep the pub-crawl<br/>
manageable and fun and intimate. It's perfect now, beware the beast<br/>
that lurks behind the enthusiasm.<br/>

Yes the show is fabulous and<br/>yes it's the most anticipated event of the year for our little group<br/>but it's seriously in danger of collapsing under it's own weight. It<br/>very nearly ended one year ago when the hostess wasn't up to the task<br/>and failed to do any of the planning and prep work. The show was a<br/>fiasco partly because of her failings and partly because of events<br/>beyond her control but the progression to greater and greater heights<br/>cannot be sustained and I'm now in fear of the monster I helped create. <br/><br/>I would urge you all to seriously consider the notion of a progression<br/>in the pub crawl tradition toward bigger and bigger and better and<br/>better or the whole thing could come crashing down in a blaze<br/>disappointment, regret and resentment. It very nearly did in our "No<br/>Talent Show" tradition. Let each person
 make it their own and keep it<br/>special; meaning, I would urge you to try to keep it to once a year.<br/>There's a reason Santa only comes once a year...<br/><br/>For Her Ladyship the pub-crawl has become a wonderfully fun way to<br/>letterbox and meet others. It would be a tragedy to see it get out of<br/>hand. Look at letterboxing in general everyone's enthusiasm for the<br/>hobby makes them want to make it bigger and better but in her<br/>Ladyship's opinion it has now gotten so big it's unmanageable to the<br/>point where we now have factions, splinter groups, play-my-way- or-not-<br/>at-all secret groups etc.<br/><br/>I urge everyone to keep a long-term perspective, keep the pub-crawl<br/>manageable and fun and intimate. It's perfect now, beware the beast<br/>that lurks behind the enthusiasm.<br/><br/>LP<br/><br/></div></div></blockquote><br/><br/><br/><div><strong><em><font style="BACKGROUND-COLOR:#ff7f00;">&lt;a href="<a href="http://photobucket.com" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://photobucket.com</a>" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="<a href="http://i11.photobucket.com/albums/a151/BullDawg717/sigstamp.jpg" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://i11.photobucket.com/albums/a151/BullDawg717/sigstamp.jpg</a>" border="0" alt="Photo Sharing and Video Hosting at Photobucket"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;</font></em></strong></div><p>
