That annoying series of boxes of mine again.<br/>
NJP102 missing. Really? Oh, yes, indeed, clue goes like this, yada, <br/>
yada, nothing behind the rock, blah, blah.<br/>
Another pair of replacement stamps carved. Book, baggies, container. <br/>
Drive an hour, hike in the heat, look under tree.<br/>
Box is waaaaaaaay back there. Dry. Fine.<br/>
I have now carved the entire series twice but put out only two <br/>
replacement boxes.<br/>
Argh.<br/>

already found it?  You could try to write to that person first and say, "Hey, so I 
don't have to ride up there, can you tell me if my box is still there?"  Just 
a thought.  May not be possible?

the back way from the parking lot and told her it was just a short <br/>
walk, as far as I could remember. But my memory wasn't so good and we <br/>
walked all the way back to the main trail and back again... twice as <br/>
far as if we had just followed the directions. <br/>
<br/>
Anyways, the box is in good shape.<br/>
