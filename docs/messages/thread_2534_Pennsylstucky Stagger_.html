title...The Dirtiest Letterboxer! I have been to New Hope two or three <br/>
times . . . but it was over thirty years ago... and all I remember is <br/>
the Bucks County Playhouse... and I dont think that's a bar... so I am <br/>
clueless. Get out there and start your scouting... give us some idea <br/>
about where to stay.</div>
