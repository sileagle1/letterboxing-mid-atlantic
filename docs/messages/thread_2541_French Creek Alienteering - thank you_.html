Heard about Amy smacking the birthday cake   :)<br/>
<br/>
Some interesting moments later, when the ranger approached us at the <br/>
campground to talk about not parking on the grass because of the <br/>
restoration efforts there.  Seems like we had about a case or so of <br/>
beer in those coolers right in front of him but Coke cans on the <br/>
table.   ;)<br/>

exchanging (stories, stamps, histories, ideas...!) &amp; boxing &amp; playing <br/>
for all of us.  We left early this afternoon - after finding a few <br/>
more boxes that we ran out of time for yesterday &amp; being stumped by <br/>
the bonus box (more on that later, LB).  <br/>
<br/>
We had a great time with our new friends, the Keystone Khans - it IS <br/>
more fun to box with more kids and more brains!  Sameera is <br/>
definitely more observant that I am (ketchup), and Farhan was <br/>
definitely taking advantage of the more gullible among us.  I threw a <br/>
few muggles off by loudly referring to "feeling better now?" as the <br/>
boys &amp; I came back on the trail (kudos to Peter for tossing the box <br/>
into the bush so the muggles couldn't see it; we'll update you on the <br/>
poison ivy count when we next log on).  The kids got along so well, <br/>
it was like a dream.  <br/>
<br/>
As for night activity, we can confirm the rangers are keeping their <br/>
eyes on those families with young children up too late - no loud <br/>
noises by those kids, people; get them in bed, er, bag.  <br/>
<br/>
We are all exhausted, both our boys are on the couch behind me passed <br/>
out cold - they might be in trouble w/ the rangers again tonight.  :) <br/>

for almost 3 years and meeting new letterboxers. I also really liked <br/>
how the letterboxing clues were combined with Orienteering. Ohh one <br/>
more thing thanks for the patches Irene. <br/>

time.  It was only our family's second camping trip, and the kids<br/>
wanted to go again before we even got out of the park.  The little one<br/>
was asleep almost as soon as the car started moving, and the older one<br/>
didn't make it to the Turnpike.  Everyone was exhausted from all the<br/>
fun.  Oh and the adults from a night with a flat airmattress.  There<br/>
are a whole lot of rocks and roots in that campground.  <br/>
<br/>
We are looking forward to another gathering, hopefully something will<br/>
be scheduled that we can attend.<br/>

Thanks to everyone who did the planning, brought the yummy yummy <br/>
food, and shared their Saturday afternoon with me!  It was great to <br/>
meet new new folks and catch up with y'all that I met last fall at <br/>
the DE Games.  I really wished this weekend that I could be in two <br/>
places at once - my old friends were 15 minutes away from French <br/>
Creek, having a weekend-long party, and I was torn, TORN, I tells ya, <br/>
between the two events!<br/>

If anyone is interested, there is a gather planned September 22 in <br/>
St. Louis, Missouri:<br/>

My good friend (whom I have not yet met in the flesh) Heather of The <br/>
B Hunters is organizing, and it promises to be a blast.  To be held <br/>
in the largest city park in the US, Forest Park, with a "World's <br/>
Fair" theme.  Even if you can't attend, I'm sure Heather would love a <br/>
stamp or two mailed to her (hint hint!)...<br/>
<br/>
ANYWAY, thanks again and again - I'm one tired, sore and happy <br/>
letterboxer!<br/>

Yes, the area betwixt controls 3 and 4 can be rather rooty.  We <br/>
imported the rocks just for this event, so now we have to move them <br/>
back to the Appalachian Trail.  ;-)<br/>

&gt; &gt; PS: fleurdelis, I didn't see you trip out there.  Methinks you <br/>
&gt; &gt; exaggerate for comic effect!  ;-D<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; While I won't say that I'm not guilty of trying to get a laugh out <br/>
of<br/>
&gt; people, I really did trip numerous times while out on the course! <br/>
The<br/>
&gt; fact that you didn't see me must mean I'm getting good at righting<br/>
&gt; myself before I actually do a face plant into the dirt! :)<br/>
