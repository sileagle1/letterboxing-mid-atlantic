efforts of BullDawg.<br/>
<br/>
As for French Creek I had to cancel after arriving home 20 hours late<br/>
from AK.  The whole time (as in 3 hrs) I stood in line at USAir Customer<br/>
Service waiting to be re-booked - I was just relieved this didn't happen<br/>
on my way to Alaska.<br/>
<br/>
I too have about 300 pics, and after a quick review, have come to the<br/>
conclusion you can't take a bad pic in AK (unless you jiggle the<br/>
camera).  It is truly a picture post card state -- and post cards were<br/>
the cheapest thing there at 20 cents - so I have plenty of those too!<br/>
<br/>
Looks like the next LBMA gather isn't until Sept 8 at Knoebels.  So I<br/>
hope everyone has a great summer.  Meanwhile I still need to do<br/>
maintenance on DE Games boxes and those pesky Porpoises.<br/>
