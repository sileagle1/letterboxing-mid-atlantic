<br/>
Alternatively you can go to the boxes page, and so long it is listed as <br/>
an event box, you can add the event from there.<br/>

                    <div id="ygrps-yiv-1378511520">I have wrestled with this problem a lot with the Circus event <br/>
stamps. The question is whether the stamps are available "on the <br/>
table", or are they Planted or hidden? Do they require enough work <br/>
to justify counting them as "Finds" for the purpose of PFX counts? <br/>
<br/>
Planted event stamps -- Traditional or Mystery - Any stamp at an <br/>
event that can be counted as a find I think should be separately <br/>
listed as a Traditional box or a Mystery box. That way when people <br/>
Record them they count in PFX. <br/>
<br/>
A Traditional listing will show up with the gather by location as a <br/>
nearby stamp. If it is at the gather for only one day this is kind <br/>
of a waste. Instead you can list the stamp as a Mystery box with no <br/>
location. Then the same listing can be used over and over. The only <br/>
problem is there is no easy way to associate the box listing with <br/>
the event. I like the idea of using the event name in the box name, <br/>
like "Great Castle Quest: Urquart Castle". If it attends another <br/>
event, I dare you to just rename the box with the next event, <br/>
like "Scottish Fling: Urquart Castle". Then you can just list in the <br/>
clues all of the events it went to.  <br/>
<br/>
For 'Great Castle Quest', the hosts listed all the planted stamps as <br/>
a Mystery box with multiple stamps. Then they just wrote all <br/>
attendees where they could find them for recording. Not hard since a <br/>
Basic Search for "Great Castle Quest" will find them. <br/>
<br/>
For 'Summer Slam Pub Crawl' he listed all the boxes as an Event box <br/>
with multiple stamps and he could then tie the listing to the event. <br/>
<br/>
On the Table Event stamps -- These are the traveling event stamps <br/>
for which the "Event" stamp listing was created. Stamps like 'K-<br/>
MartHa", "LbNA Map", and "Boch's Circus". They get one listing and <br/>
can be assigned to one event after another. This makes it easy to <br/>
keep track of where they are and where they've been. <br/>
<br/>
Only problem is that they do not count as "Finds". For "on the <br/>
table" this is appropriate. But I encourage people to plant Boch's <br/>
Circus so this makes it complicated. Most people just use the Event <br/>
style listing anyway and not worry about the count. <br/>
<br/>
Oh I do try to complicate things to manipulate the system don't I? <br/>
We sure make it difficult for Ryan with all of out permutations. <br/>
