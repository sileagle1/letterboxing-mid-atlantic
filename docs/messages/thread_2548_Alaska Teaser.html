<div>I have most of the pictures from our trip ready for you to look at but I want to wait until I get Judy's CD so I can include some of them. She has some good ones that I didn't get. I'd like to have them all together rather than two bunches to look at. I took a tripod so we have both of us in some of them. </div>

<div>Sooooooooo, in anticipitation and to keep you interested, I posted a map of Alaska with our route on it and the miles we traveled. You should have an idea of just how far we traveled. We saw widely varying types of terrain, from huge snow covered mountains, to marshland, to forests full of "christmas trees", to the flat terrain that took us toward Healy and Denali National Park. And we met lots of people who took packaged trips on buses. This way was MUCH better! </div>

the map I'm exhausted again!<br/>
<br/>
But wouldn't have missed it for the world.  Clues are up for "Salmon<br/>
Enchanted Evening" and now to find my picture notes (apparently the<br/>
record on the camera was off for one of the "RHB'rs Take Flight" - so<br/>
I'll be winging it!)<br/>
