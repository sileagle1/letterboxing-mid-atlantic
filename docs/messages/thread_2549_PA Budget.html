not be up to date on the news and who may be traveling to<br/>
box in a Pennsylvania State Park next week.  All state parks will be<br/>
closed as of midnight on Monday until Pennsylvania passes a budget. <br/>
This includes my local state parks, French Creek and Nolde Forest, so<br/>
before you travel to letterbox, you may want to check whether our<br/>
parks are state or county or local parks so you don't waste a trip.  <br/>
<br/>
We are a state who brags about the fact that there is a state park<br/>
within 25 miles of every Pennsylvanian so these closings could be a<br/>
big blow to us.  Hopefully, the budget will be signed quickly and no<br/>
one will have to suffer the loss of our 61 state parks for any length<br/>
of time.<br/>
<br/>
So box till you drop this weekend and enjoy our beautiful parks while<br/>

On a practical level, I agree - anyone willing to walk a bit and <br/>
smart enough to stay away from major routes and prime attractions in <br/>
a park can probably go and play.  Don't twist an ankle, though.<br/>

The governor is pushing for the casino control staff - also a <br/>
necessary government function, like police and health inspectors and <br/>
lottery officials - to remain on the job.  It's a bold and courageous <br/>
act of leadership, to be sure.<br/>

&gt; This includes my local state parks, French Creek and Nolde Forest, <br/>
so<br/>
&gt; before you travel to letterbox, you may want to check whether our<br/>

&gt; We are a state who brags about the fact that there is a state park<br/>
&gt; within 25 miles of every Pennsylvanian so these closings could be a<br/>
&gt; big blow to us. Hopefully, the budget will be signed quickly and no<br/>
