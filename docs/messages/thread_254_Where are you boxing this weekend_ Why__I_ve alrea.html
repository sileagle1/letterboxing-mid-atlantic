<div>Woo-Hoo! Hikers &amp; Hounds was actually a first finder on a box! Can you believe it? Can you believe we actually found a letterbox!LOL! After last weekends fiasco at Brandywine Springs (I was right on top of the 2nd box and couldn't find it) I was beginning to think I wasn't going to find Silver Eagles "Mint Eagle" box either! I got out of work at 5:00, ran home, grabbed DWD (Dude the Wonder Dog) and raced back to NE Philly and Penny Pack Park clues in hand. Of course we went the wrong way, he said left we took it literally and went left. etc. We hunted every dirt trail at 180 degrees in that section of pennypack, I swear! Finally I said "Dude old man, it ain't happenin for us today brother" and we headed back to the car. I noticed a tiny trail I hadn't checked out cause I was sure it was in the wrong spot. But I decided "what the hell" and lo and behold, there were the double tree's and the tree off the trail that held the box, and we were the first to stamp
 in! </div>
<div> </div>
<div>Tomorrow I am pretty sure we're hittin' one of Jennifer's Jane Austin boxes then hunting my own boxes in Tinicum. Carmen went back up there last weekend and supposedly fixed the clues. Before I post them again, Dude and I will hunt the boxes ourselves. Since we didn't carve the stamps nor plant the boxes we're gonna count them as finds...if we find them. Then a couple of boxes on the way home and a beautiful drive down River Road. </div>

Great that you were FTF.  Tom and I were on a few recent finds <br/>
(Raindear's Under the Sea and the newly restored Jacobsburg series).<br/>
<br/>
I've got the stamps carved and boxes made for a 3 box series that <br/>
will culminate in the HH Race Destination - the South Mountain HHH!<br/>

Have a great weekend,<br/>

</span></blockquote>Nope, we pretty much walked directly to the box!<br/>
<br/>
Recently, we went back to a box that I had searched for *twice* and had <br/>
been unable to find, back when I was just getting started letterboxing a <br/>
couple of years ago. This time, I zeroed in on it really quickly and was <br/>
amazed at how I could have spent so long looking in the wrong place the two <br/>
times I had tried to find the box before. It wasn't even a difficult clue <br/>
or an unobvious hiding place.<br/>
<br/>
I like to theorize that you can develop a "sixth sense" about letterboxes <br/>
after you've found your first hundred or two -- and this then helps you to <br/>
figure out where a letterbox is on a more instinctive, intuitive level <br/>
instead of following the specifics of the clues. I saw evidence of this <br/>
theory last year when I went letterboxing with Princess Lea &amp; Amanda from <br/>
Seattle out in CA, and was constantly surprised at how Amanda would walk <br/>
directly to the letterbox we were looking for, with no pause to take in the <br/>
final leg of the clue. She would know what side of the big tree on which to <br/>
look without having to walk around the whole tree.<br/>
<br/>
Another thing that helps as you find more and more letterboxes is getting <br/>
to know the clue "style" of the person who planted a particular box. After <br/>
you've found several boxes planted by the same letterboxer, you can get a <br/>
sense of how their clues are meant to be deciphered -- do they like to <br/>
throw in tricky parts or are the clues very direct, are their paces a <br/>
little shorter or a little longer, would they be the type to direct us to <br/>
that deer trail that's barely visible off the side of the trail or should <br/>
we go on to the next major path instead? You can gain this kind of insight <br/>
from experience. Of course, some letterboxers like to mix it up in clues to <br/>
their different boxes, so knowing something about the clue writer doesn't <br/>
always provide you with any "tells."<br/>
<br/>
Anyhow, just musing here -- back to my day's chores now!<br/>

                    <div id="ygrps-yiv-699615416"><div>Ok, well that sixth sense thing? I don't have it yet. Today Carvin Carmen actually decided<br/>to go letterboxing with his ole Ma. First we went to Tinicum and I hunted our own boxes to double check his clues. The first is a peice of cake that anyone can do, even kids. The second is in a terrible spot and I begged him to move it but he wants it where it is. You can see the danged tree from the towpath, but I'll be damned if I can figure out how to get down to it. </div>
<div> </div>
<div>Anyway, on our way home we decided to hunt Indigo Turtle and Cyclonic's Scudders Falls Brdige box. I wanted to do more but we got a late start.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Well I know we were on the correct part of the towpath, past the not so Golden Pheasant, and the three gears. I'm pretty darned sure we were at the right tree, but we couldn't find anything. I am convinced at this point I only have 3-4 senses. My eyesight is going so the 5th sense is questionable and there's no way on earth I have a sixth sense!</div>
<div> </div>
<div>We didn't hunt Floating Feather because I heard somewhere it was missing (I think, who knows). We did find Scudders Falls Bridge after I gave up looking for a Maple and went with the big honkin' Oak. Okay, so maybe a hint of a sixth sense.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Anyway, am hoping to grab a quick box in the AM, do some chores, run some errands then off to see the Dead with son #2, Boogie Bob.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Enjoy the rest of the weekend!</div>

Often we'll be well into a hike when one of the kids asks,"WHOSE box <br/>

of WINGfoot, one must be quite the hiker, no?  "This must be <br/>
the 'one short climb'" ... "Is our hour up yet?" ... "Oh, no, THIS <br/>
is the climb" ... "This is a 'short hike'?" ... "Look at that <br/>

supposed to get up there?".... "Do you think the rescuers will ever <br/>
find our bodies?" ...<br/>
Granted, it did turn out the next day that I really did have <br/>
pneumonia, but we learned a lot about clue style that day.<br/>

Eagle Bob and I just got back from the Pinnacle and Pulpit Rock.  We <br/>
were abel to find Silent Doug's restored letterboxes [though they <br/>
were not in offical Silent Doug Milan tupperware ;-) ] and plant a <br/>
new one, the "Pulpit Rock Observatory".  Clues will be posted to the <br/>
database soon!  The shortcuts we took were able to drop the roundtrip <br/>
distance to about 6-6.5 miles.  Careful though, there are serious <br/>
climbs and rocks.  Flip-flops would not work here!  ;-)  Don those <br/>
clodhoppers!<br/>
<br/>
Man, the Pinnacle and Pulpit Rock area was CROWDED today, more so <br/>
than I have ever seen up there.  Bob thinks it was the fact that it <br/>
was a Sunday and very nice weather after and prior to some very warm <br/>
weeks.  Be sure to check out the cairn in Silent Doug's clues for the <br/>
Pinnacle.  We think it may be an impromptu 9/11 memorial of some <br/>
sort.  Toss a rock on to make it grow!<br/>
<br/>
Have a great Sunday,<br/>

me! Waaaahhhaaaahhhaaaahaaaaa!(manical laugh) My fiendish plot of <br/>
planting a box in my own backyard is working perfectly! Soon I will <br/>
be king of all EXCHANGES!!!!!! Wait a minute....that means I don't <br/>
get to hunt them.....maybe I need to start another dastardly plot to <br/>
get them to hide microboxes in my garden....no, then I won't visit <br/>
all the beautiful places....and at the current rate of visitors it <br/>
will take me decades to even catch up much less pass any of the the <br/>
real oldtimer boxers in exchanges......oh well, at least I'm havin <br/>
fun and meeting some boxers.<br/>
The truth of it all is that our 1st, (and currently only posted <br/>
clues) plant is in our nature trail behind our studio home. See <br/>
the "Green Rose Labyrinth" in MD for details. Its a commercial space <br/>
with a public garden and so far we have actually been here for 4 of <br/>
the 6 stamps it's collected which is pretty cool, So even on wknds <br/>
when we don't get to hunt, (with MD RenFaire starting up soon that <br/>
will be every wknd) we get to sometimes get to meet and exchange <br/>
stamps. Lots of fun, we meet the "Garden Patch Family" this wknd. <br/>
Great little family, Grandmother, Mom, and 3 kids, 9, 3, and one a <br/>
babe in arms. We have been plesantly admiring their stamp at local <br/>
boxes, (which for info of those who feel embarassed by their <br/>
storebought stamp, is a STOREBOUGHT STAMP AND WE LOVE IT!) Great <br/>
littl group of scarecrows in a row! It was nice to put a face and <br/>
they said they had been boxing with the kids for over a year and <br/>
never meet anyone and exchanged. Strange, we've been boxing for just <br/>
a few months and we are atleast E10 or so,.....A HA! MY PLAN IS <br/>
WORKING AFTER ALL!!!!<br/>
Peaceful Trails,<br/>

Biking it can be done if you have very low gears, but you'd have to <br/>
take the LVAAS road up to the Pulpit Rock, come back down and then <br/>
take the regular trails or Furnace Creek shortcut to the Pinnacle and <br/>
come back down.  We did see a couple of adventurous bikers doing it <br/>
