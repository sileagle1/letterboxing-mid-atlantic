times that I can go are limited. So when I have time to go on a nice <br/>
hike with a new box... I have to go. I was mesmerized by the Zodiac <br/>
series... and yes. . .  a bit spooked. The theme kind of psyched me <br/>
out. I tried very hard to get someone to go with me... but none of <br/>
the usual suspects were availlable. So I went alone. No big deal. I <br/>
do it all the time right? Plus I knew the trail. I was at the trail <br/>
head very early. There were no cars and there is only one trail head. <br/>
No activity. It was a cold spring morning. I had the whole mountain <br/>
to myself. (or did I?)  About one mile up the trail... I stopped to <br/>
get rid of a little coffee... son of a bitch! . . . there was someone <br/>
coming up the trail behind me! About two hundred yards below hiking <br/>
at a very quick pace was a large white male... dressed all in black! <br/>
Black pants, black hooded jacket and sunglasses. I couldn't believe <br/>
what I was seeing. I thought it was the Zodiac himself... laying in <br/>
wait in the old mill ruins... just waiting for someone to come find <br/>
the letterbox. Well obviously I survived... but I hiked up that hill <br/>
for a half hour looking over my shoulder at the mysterious hooded <br/>
hiker coming up the hill. As I got toward the top I took a side trail <br/>
that I knew would loop back and allow me to get a good look. I re-<br/>
emerged on the main trail just as my "stalker" appeared. Turns out it <br/>
was just another hiker... enjoying a brisk morning hike. Nothing <br/>
more. I allowed him to pass, went on to find the box (First finder of <br/>
a Zodiac Box) then went about the rest of my day. But for thirty <br/>
minutes my imagination allowed me to hike with a serial killer coming <br/>
up the tril behind me.<br/>

my "stalker" was Zodiak the Letterboxer...just a guy out getting a <br/>
good hike in... but yes I did see his face and even talked him a bit. <br/>
(I may get on an elevator in an office building and not talk to <br/>
people ... but I feel inclined to give an appropriate friendly <br/>
greeting to a stranger I meet on a mountain top!)<br/>
<br/>
Yes this guy was mid late 20's but under the black hoodie he had <br/>
redish blond hair and freckles... <br/>
<br/>
So Bulldawg.... do you want to go to Mount Rogers with me in October? <br/>
I hear there are wild horses roaming meadows of rhododendrens! I'm <br/>
not going to post which date I'm going... because I don't want to set <br/>
myself up for ambush!!!<br/>

Zodiac's "Murder at Bull Run" Box I hiked alone. The <br/>

nice <br/>
&gt; hike with a new box... I have to go. I was mesmerized by the Zodiac <br/>
&gt; series... and yes. . . a bit spooked. The theme kind of psyched me <br/>
&gt; out. I tried very hard to get someone to go with me... but none of <br/>
&gt; the usual suspects were availlable. So I went alone. No big deal. I <br/>
&gt; do it all the time right? Plus I knew the trail. I was at the trail <br/>
&gt; head very early. There were no cars and there is only one trail <br/>
head. <br/>
&gt; No activity. It was a cold spring morning. I had the whole mountain <br/>
&gt; to myself. (or did I?) About one mile up the trail... I stopped to <br/>
&gt; get rid of a little coffee... son of a bitch! . . . there was <br/>
someone <br/>
&gt; coming up the trail behind me! About two hundred yards below hiking <br/>
&gt; at a very quick pace was a large white male... dressed all in <br/>
black! <br/>
&gt; Black pants, black hooded jacket and sunglasses. I couldn't believe <br/>
&gt; what I was seeing. I thought it was the Zodiac himself... laying in <br/>
&gt; wait in the old mill ruins... just waiting for someone to come find <br/>
&gt; the letterbox. Well obviously I survived... but I hiked up that <br/>
hill <br/>
&gt; for a half hour looking over my shoulder at the mysterious hooded <br/>
&gt; hiker coming up the hill. As I got toward the top I took a side <br/>
trail <br/>
&gt; that I knew would loop back and allow me to get a good look. I re-<br/>
&gt; emerged on the main trail just as my "stalker" appeared. Turns out <br/>
it <br/>
&gt; was just another hiker... enjoying a brisk morning hike. Nothing <br/>
&gt; more. I allowed him to pass, went on to find the box (First finder <br/>
of <br/>
&gt; a Zodiac Box) then went about the rest of my day. But for thirty <br/>
&gt; minutes my imagination allowed me to hike with a serial killer <br/>
coming <br/>
&gt; up the tril behind me.<br/>
