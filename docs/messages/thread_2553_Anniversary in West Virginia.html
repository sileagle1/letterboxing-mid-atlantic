                    <div id="ygrps-yiv-1709453967">It occurred to us last week that with one child at camp and another <br/>
on a church trip to Mexico that the three remaining teenagers at <br/>
home could manage on their own, so my husband and I drove to West <br/>
Virginia for a 3-day getaway to celebrate our 27th anniversary.  And <br/>
to please me, my noxer husband agreed to some letterboxing!<br/>
<br/>
Hah!  "Some" never satisfies an addict!  We ended up finding 13/15 <br/>
that we searched for, and my dh tracked down a few of those himself!<br/>
<br/>
We really appreciated the historical and geological sites that we <br/>
visited looking for the boxes, plus a series of 1 and 2 mile hikes <br/>
in absolutely gorgeous forests, plateaus, bogs, and meadows.<br/>
<br/>
Our very last box required a second stop and had my dh and I "spruce-<br/>
diving" up and down a rocky ridge for an hour, and just as we were <br/>
about to give up [again] because twilight was setting in, under the  <br/>
most unlikely of trees, there it was.  While I stamped in, dh <br/>
interpreted the clues from the end backwards, and, well, we really <br/>
disagreed with the first clue which sent us a half mile in the wrong <br/>
direction, but we choose to be forgiving in victory!<br/>
<br/>
I have a new anniversary digital camera, too, so I'll try to post a <br/>
photo...<br/>

to spend an anniversary ;)  My family has had a cabin in Pocahontas <br/>
Co. near Minnehaha Springs for the past 36 years (I'm almost 36, btw) <br/>
and we have spent family vacations there every year while my Dad was <br/>
alive.  After my grandfather passed away it was up to us to help <br/>
grandma go up once a month to keep the grass mowed, maintenance, etc.  <br/>
So needless to say, when I got married I insisted that we spend our <br/>
honeymoon at the cabin.  Now, every chance we get we spend our <br/>
anniversary there, and get in a little boxing ;)  Too bad I didn't <br/>
know about letterboxing when we got married -- at the time of year we <br/>
spend our honeymoon there nothing was open because it was before <br/>
Memorial Day!!  So hubby had to put up with me going to used book <br/>
stores ;)<br/>
