<div><strong><font color="#ff0000">********</font></strong>IN ORDER TO SEE PHOTOS IN CORRECT ORDER, CLICK FIRST ON THE ALBUM ENTITLED ALASKA THE LAST FRONTIER AND THEN ON ALASKA2.

<div>I wish I could have put all of them up but no one would ever speak to me again!!  LOL We have a LOT of pictures!! I tried to condense our journey from place and include the greatest scenery shots. I tried to give you a sense of our travels, the interesting, funny amd beautiful. I could have put up some more but I think less is better. A lot of the pics kind of loose something unless you were there. &lt;s&gt; Those of you who have been forced to sit through endless vacations shots will know what I mean. </div>
