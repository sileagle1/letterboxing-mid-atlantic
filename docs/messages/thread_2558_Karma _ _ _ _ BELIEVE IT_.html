                    <div id="ygrps-yiv-1850121005">So back in February I received a message from a boxer telling me <br/>
that my AM-2 box in Rhode Island had apparently been muggled.  All <br/>
they found was a soaking wet log book on the ground nearby.  I <br/>
placed the box in November and it hadn't even recorded a find yet.  <br/>
I was SO MAD!  So, when I got a chance, I recarved the stamp, put <br/>
together a new box and this past weekend I finally got a chance to <br/>
go up to RI and replant it, in a different location of course.  <br/>
<br/>
Thinking of how I found Sheba's Red Heron box launched into the <br/>
woods 30 feet from the site, I decided to return to the crime <br/>
scene.  I started walking out a spiral around the site to see what <br/>
may turn up.  About 20 feet out, I found the box bottom but nothing <br/>
turned up out to about 50 feet.  I'm walking back towards the site <br/>
and I see this rock the size of a piece of bread resting between the <br/>
roots of a tree.  It was in a typical location that you might see <br/>
some smaller boxes planted.  On a whim I looked behind the rock and <br/>
there it was . .  .  the stamp!  Some JACKASS had taken the time to <br/>
destroy parts of the stone wall I had hidden the box in, throw the <br/>
contents about in the woods, but then deliberatley hide the stamp in <br/>
the roots of a tree . . . ?  WTF?!!!  I really don't get people <br/>
sometimes.  <br/>
<br/>
Anyway . . . the point being, I must have done SOMETHING right along <br/>
the way to have the luck to find the stamp.  Karma . . . it's <br/>
watching you!</div>

I think it was your boxer's intuition kicking<br/>
in...there's just something about a rock that has been<br/>

<p>So back in February I received a message from a boxer telling me <br/>that 
  my AM-2 box in Rhode Island had apparently been muggled. All <br/>they found 
  was a soaking wet log book on the ground nearby. I <br/>placed the box in 
  November and it hadn't even recorded a find yet. <br/>I was SO MAD! So, when I 
  got a chance, I recarved the stamp, put <br/>together a new box and this past 
  weekend I finally got a chance to <br/>go up to RI and replant it, in a 
  different location of course. <br/><br/>Thinking of how I found Sheba's Red 
  Heron box launched into the <br/>woods 30 feet from the site, I decided to 
  return to the crime <br/>scene. I started walking out a spiral around the site 
  to see what <br/>may turn up. About 20 feet out, I found the box bottom but 
  nothing <br/>turned up out to about 50 feet. I'm walking back towards the site 
  <br/>and I see this rock the size of a piece of bread resting between the 
  <br/>roots of a tree. It was in a typical location that you might see <br/>some 
  smaller boxes planted. On a whim I looked behind the rock and <br/>there it was 
  . . . the stamp! Some JACKASS had taken the time to <br/>destroy parts of the 
  stone wall I had hidden the box in, throw the <br/>contents about in the woods, 
  but then deliberatley hide the stamp in <br/>the roots of a tree . . . ? 
  WTF?!!! I really don't get people <br/>sometimes. <br/><br/>Anyway . . . the 
  point being, I must have done SOMETHING right along <br/>the way to have the 
  luck to find the stamp. Karma . . . it's <br/>watching you!<br/><br/></p></div></blockquote></span></blockquote></html>

I did post clue updates saying that it had been muggled back around <br/>
February.  The same thing happened to me this past weekend.  Had clues for <br/>
some boxes in George Washington Park up in Gloscter, RI.  They had changed <br/>
the clues to one of the 5 boxes int eh series . . .  something I didn't <br/>
notice until after I went to their webpage to leave them a message.<br/>
<br/>
New clues for AM-2 will be posted within a couple weeks.  Work is busy and <br/>
I'm doing a lot of house hunting.  Stay tuned . . . .<br/>

Actually Dave and I just went in search of that box. We had an old printout <br/>
and didn't know the box was missing! We didn't see any of what you describe.<br/>
Have you updated the website with the new clues?<br/>
