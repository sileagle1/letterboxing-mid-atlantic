Paoli Library! I have a box there already!<br/>
Clues not too bad, fairly clever. Went for the box, huge container, very public place, inside <br/>
container log wrapped in and Acme bag.<br/>
I contacted the placer to let them know I was first finder. She responded the box was planted <br/>
as part of a teen program. It wasn't till after they placed the box that they found out there <br/>
was a box in the library.<br/>
For all the box was lacking they did carve the stamp. Although they did make the first time <br/>
carver's mistake of not reversing the image.</div>
