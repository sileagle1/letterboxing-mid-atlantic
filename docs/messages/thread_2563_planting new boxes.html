have just planted a series of 8 and one single in Truxton Park on <br/>
hilltop Road in Annapolis. The park has a nice view of spa creek and a <br/>
partial view of downtown Annapolis. Hope you will make it sown and find <br/>
our plants. Trying to populate Annapolis as no boxes were here, with <br/>
the exeption of the Bay Bridge / Sandy Point, woodthrush box and a <br/>
couplle within driving distance. So come on to Annapolis and see what's <br/>
here. Bring a fishing pole and or a picnic. <br/>
