&gt; Congratulations, sir.  A fine location.  I notice that it's only <br/>
about 17.5 miles from sweet, sweet beer . . . OK, maybe just <br/>
beer . . . .<br/>

was indeed called yesterday to be the pastor of<br/>

&gt; far from Ricketts Glen, or from Knoebel's. <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I'll start there on August 6. Quite exciting! I'm very grateful for<br/>
&gt; all the support and encouragement I've got from so many of you over<br/>
&gt; the past year or two. Thank you all so much!<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Maybe I'll carve a special personal traveler for any letterboxer who<br/>
