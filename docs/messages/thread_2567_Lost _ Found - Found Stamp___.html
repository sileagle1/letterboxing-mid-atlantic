State Park, I crossed the water into PA and did the box "Bucks <br/>
Covered Bridge Series #2 - Van Sant Bridge".  After stamping in and <br/>
re-hidng the box I went back up to the bridge and looked down as I <br/>
was about to cross back over to my car. In the middle of the path <br/>
that I had just walked on was a stamp...it was as clear as day from <br/>
above..even though I walked by it below without noticing it.  I went <br/>
down and retrieved it and it appears to possibly be someone's <br/>
signature stamp.  It is a red hat which is made out of the small <br/>
combination of letters "rh" and there are dozens of them which make <br/>
up the shape of the hat.  I have seen the name "Red Hat Boxers" <br/>
mentioned before - although I find no listing on LBNA or AQ. (Except <br/>
for one variant of the spelling on AQ that has only 1 plant logged).  <br/>
I did not look through the whole log in the box I had just stamped as <br/>
I was already tired after a long day and just glanced at it...but I <br/>
believe they had just stamped in days before me.  I was about to go <br/>
back down to the box to see if there was more info on the page they <br/>
stamped, but as luck would have it, a group of children w/Mom came <br/>
along and were hanging out and playing near the bridge. I waited <br/>
awhile by my car but they were going nowhere fast as the woman was <br/>
talking on her cellphone while the kids were running all over the <br/>
area (and also picking up rocks and tossing them in the area from <br/>
right near where I found the stamp...luckily I found it first).  So, <br/>
since my day was running late and my energy and water was low..I <br/>
headed off for the 1 hour drive back home.  The point of this post <br/>
should be obvious by now...is anyone famaliar with the owner of this <br/>
stamp, so that I can make contact and mail it back to them if they <br/>
would like it returned?  Any assistance would be appreciated for this <br/>
poor little lost stamp.<br/>

perhaps they started their own club....  We may never know the <br/>

&gt; &gt; &gt; Hello all, yesterday while doing some boxes in Washington <br/>
&gt; Crossing <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; State Park, I crossed the water into PA and did the box "Bucks <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; Covered Bridge Series #2 - Van Sant Bridge". After stamping in <br/>

&gt; went <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; down and retrieved it and it appears to possibly be someone's <br/>

&gt; &gt; &gt; for one variant of the spelling on AQ that has only 1 plant <br/>

Got 2 great boxes inside a museum, great urban type plants, the boxes were Tin Tin and Snowy and Cuthbertson. Another great box was the Sound Waves box at the wave organ. The wave organ is a stucture out on a jetty in the SF bay, there are no signs that even tell you it;s there until you are right on top of it. Great views of bridge and Alcatraz. Clues were a bit cryptic but thought I would just turn over a few rocks and find it. Found a geocache, some boxes had founf it and thought it was the box. An hout later no box, gave up. Talked to Princess Lea on the phone, she said the location was in the clues. Gave it another try the next day, as I was walking out on the jetty the clues made sense and I walked right to the box. What do I find in the box? A HH started in "02 by our very own DNA with lots of stamps from the locals, including Cyclonic. Haven't decided if I'll return it to the east coast or drop it off
