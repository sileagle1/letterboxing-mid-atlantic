<br/>
I had some excellent correspondence this week with a relatively new boxer who also <br/>
geocaches, psbales. They had attempted my Patuxent Confluence box but could not locate it, <br/>
and they kindly emailed me. A few days later they stopped by the park office for another <br/>
reason and noticed my letterbox sitting in the office. Once again they kindly emailed me. <br/>
<br/>
Yesterday I was able to retrieve the box from the office and have a nice conversation with the <br/>
park official who had picked it up. It seems like some folks had opened it up and strewn the <br/>
contents around. When the official, who was on trash detail, found it scattered all over the <br/>
place, he at first thought it was trash, but then realized what it was, and so kindly looked in <br/>
the general area for what parts he could salvage.<br/>
<br/>
Inside the box were the stamp and my "this is a letterbox" notice, but no logbook.<br/>
<br/>
I thanked this man profusely for his kindness! And I am deeply grateful to pbsales as well.<br/>
<br/>
All this to say that 1) Like Blanche DuBois I am dependent on (and thankful for) the kindness <br/>
of strangers, and 2) I am retiring the Patuxent Confluence for now.<br/>
