on the way up) and find two beauties in another location in Lancaster <br/>
County. Was solo since Black Swan had to work. I still am chuckling <br/>
over my misadventures of the day!<br/>
<br/>
Today we found one (just to get the boxin' fix) and did some check ups <br/>
on ours in Rocky Ridge. Awesome views today because of low humidity. <br/>
Wild life was abundant. Scared a few deer off and heard other rustles. <br/>
Great hike!<br/>

<br/>
I managed to get no boxing done.  Hung around the house today doing odds <br/>
and ends, this and that.  I did have a nice breakfast with Hikers and <br/>
Hounds yesterday, so I guess that can be letterbox related.<br/>

found one of LB's &amp; one of IV's and some wonderful raspberries in <br/>
between.  Fantastic!!!  Couldn't get at another couple of LB's for <br/>
various reasons (inappropriate legwear - i.e. shorts &amp; sandals - &amp; too <br/>
many muggles!!)  Our last search, not LB's, seemed to be in a tree <br/>
literally wrapped in poison ivy.  I cannot imagine not being allergic; <br/>
therefore, cannot conceive of how one would get at any box therein.  It <br/>
still gives me the shivers.  I hope the Purell works on the inadvertent <br/>
touches!  Allentown was a nice city - we'll certainly be back.  <br/>
<br/>
also, btw, when we were vacationing out in UT/CO earlier this month, we <br/>
had such a great experience in the Moab, UT area &amp; Colorado Springs.  I <br/>
wish we had gone online to try to make contact before we headed there.  <br/>
We were emailed by some of the planters after we logged our finds, but <br/>
had already headed home.  Kind of wish we had been able to meet up w/ <br/>
some of them.  Very friendly folks and absolutely amazing scenery.  Is <br/>
this what some of you more experienced boxers do when you travel?  <br/>

weddings are 3 day affairs, we didn't have much time for boxing.  We<br/>
did pick up a couple more of the boxes in the Highways of Warren<br/>

 The poison ivy is rampant in that area, so we didn't look that hard.<br/>

<br/>
I ate at Stoney's a few years ago and remember it as being a pretty good <br/>
experience.  I always seem to forget they are there, I will have to <br/>
return again.<br/>
<br/>
A shame you missed January Blossom, it is just a mile back up the road <br/>
at the mall, hidden in a store actually, that is open late.  But hey, <br/>
you can't get them all.  I managed to walk right past a box this weekend <br/>
and not even know it.  Just means another nice four mile hike again :-)<br/>
