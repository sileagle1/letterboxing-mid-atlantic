<br/>
We went to Smithville, NJ to box today and were 1 for 7!<br/>
<br/>
I don't think we ever had so many missing!<br/>
<br/>
Railroad Creek Fish<br/>
NJ Physiography 104 <br/>
Bicycle Rail Road <br/>
Double Ditch <br/>
Smith's Woods<br/>
<br/>
All missing but Physiography 104, which was recently replaced.<br/>
<br/>
Have these been missing a while? We were just wondering if maybe the <br/>
Smithville Historic Park didn't like them there and removed them? It <br/>
was weird that a place with so many boxes, is so empty of them now.<br/>
<br/>
The bicycle rail road box was replaced by a geocache!</div>

floated away (one of them I remember being planted under a bridge).<br/>

I wondered that when replacing 105, but with that huge field all roped <br/>
off for how many gazillion cars on weekends, I can't imagine them <br/>
getting bent out of shape over additional foot-traffic on the marked <br/>
trails.<br/>
<br/>
Then again, isn't this the same county where the Pirate boxes went <br/>
missing from a park down the road a piece??<br/>
