several people have written and stated that they would be looking for <br/>
this series. I have posted an update on the clues that #4 and #7 are <br/>
MIA. So soon.... obviously my choice of a good spot were not good <br/>
spots. I will be reacrving these and replacing but I may move the boxes <br/>
slightly to a better place but keep them in the same area... The others <br/>
seem to be fine so... Just wanted to let you all know and anyone who <br/>
might be coming this way that I will get these back out as soon as I am <br/>
able and will post when I have done so and remove the missing update <br/>
from the clues. <br/>
<br/>
Thank you ! <br/>
