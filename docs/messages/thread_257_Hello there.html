<div> </div>
<div>Just wanted to share our excitement. Andy Wilkes is the young man from Bristol England who emailed the list last March (I think) about exchanging images. I was able to get lot's of people's personal stamps for him and sent them to him. He thanks you all.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Also, Carvin' Carmen created Hobo Phil, who was at the LBMA Gathering in July, and we sent him (along with a T-Shirt and the images) over to Andy. Hobo Phil now has an official Dartmoor Lettering boxing ID number and is heading up to the moor with Andy on Monday! We are pretty darn excited and I thought I would share.</div>
