                    <div id="ygrps-yiv-861896501">I was feeling really blue this morning, probably a delayed response <br/>
to all the emotional upheaval with my daughter's accident [last week <br/>
she got hit by a car while riding her bike, 4 vertebral fractures, <br/>
but she's been released, is walking and DOING GREAT!].  Anyway, I <br/>
was just sitting like a blob this morning with absolutely no energy <br/>
to do anything.  Finally my husband coaxed me out for a twenty <br/>
minute walk.  He saw me glancing into the woods where I have a box <br/>
hidden.  He said why don't you check on it?  I hadn't looked since I <br/>
planted it back in the winter.  I sat on a bench and it was a real <br/>
treat to see the stamps and read the kind comments.  <br/>
<br/>
After we got home I perked up and took him up on his offer to drive <br/>
with me to letterbox this afternoon, which I hadn't felt up to <br/>
before [now that is really down in the dumps!]  There was an elusive <br/>
Box#3 in a series of five that was bugging me.  We hiked the three <br/>
mile loop and then this dear patient man spent TWO HOURS with me <br/>
combing the woods.  You know the drill--the clues don't seem to fit <br/>
the terrain, so basically you are just searching through the forest <br/>
for the final tree that might fit the description.  Well, two hours <br/>
later all I had found was a snake under a rock..eek...so we gave it <br/>
up and continued hiking on the loop.  And much much farther down the <br/>
trail, suddenly the clues began making sense, and OH HOW EASY it is <br/>
when you are in the right place deciphering clues!  <br/>
<br/>
We were the first to ever find that 3rd box, and then I rechecked <br/>
the fifth box in the series, and the First Finders Certificate was <br/>
still there, as everyone had left it for whoever it was who actually <br/>
had found all five.  And now that was me!  <br/>
<br/>
What a great pick-me-up this afternoon was, and what a great guy!!!<br/>

with the very patient Warrior77 who said it was worth it all to see <br/>
the big smile on my face!</div>
