                    <div id="ygrps-yiv-1254179388">A few days ago Whisper Foot mentioned that the Arborology series <br/>
originally planted by La Chola has been restored with new clues and <br/>
locations (and new carvings by La Chola!) Hats off to Whisper Foot of <br/>
the Historic Letterbox Restoration Group for her hard work.<br/>
<br/>
That reminded us in the HLRG of another La Chola box we recently <br/>
restored but forgot to tell you about---Pencil Pusher.<br/>
<br/>

boxnum=6260&amp;boxname=Pencil_Pusher<br/>
<br/>
This one retains both La Chola's original choice of a hiding place and <br/>
her interesting and cryptic clues. We changed only the very end of the <br/>
clues and located the box within two feet of the original placement. We <br/>
have recarved the stamp, based on the very kind jpg images sent to us <br/>
by (if I recall correctly) Tempus Fugit.<br/>
<br/>
We hope you will enjoy this restored box, another blast from the past.<br/>
