<br/>
FROM: MR JOHN PUJEH<br/>
PHONE: +229-8675309 (LETTERBOX REPUBLIC)<br/>
EMAIL: <a href="mailto:xxxx@..." rel="nofollow" target="_blank">xxxx@...</a><br/>
<br/>
I am MR JOHN PUJEH from SLOBOVIA, a Country in an undisclosed <br/>
location. My father is MR MOMOH PUJEH, former MINISTER of <br/>
LETTERBOXING and COMMUNICATIONS and one time DEPUTY FINANCE MINISTER <br/>
in Slobovia. My father and mother were arrested by the government of <br/>
my Country and put in detention since 28/09/2001. My parents were <br/>
accused of keeping large quantity of LETTERBOXES in the house, and <br/>
also privately hiding large quantity of LETTERBOXES abroad. You can <br/>
verify this from SLOBOVIAN EMBASSY in your country. <br/>
<br/>
I escaped to a hide out in PENNSYLVANIA COMMONWEALTH, a State in <br/>
America with 1 Letterboxes containing about 1 stamp, a log book and <br/>
Forty Six Million virtual U.S. dollars (USv$46,000,000.00).  I kept <br/>
the boxes in a SECURITY &amp; TRUST COMPANY in ALLENTOWN Capital of <br/>
LEHIGH REPUBLIC. For my safety and that of the boxes, I did not let <br/>
the company know that the boxes contain a stamp and a log book. I <br/>
told them that the boxes contain FAMILY TREASURE. <br/>
<br/>
I cannot move about freely now. I need Your help urgently for both <br/>
SAFE STAMPING and LOGGING of this letterbox in your logbook. You are <br/>
one of the three email contacts given to me by a Cyber Cafe' operator <br/>
on my request for a letterboxing contact. She did not tell me your <br/>
name or country of origin. Though I did not tell her why I needed the <br/>
contact of any letterboxer. <br/>
<br/>
Because of the urgent and confidential nature of this business, you <br/>
are advised to keep everything secret for now.  if you are interested <br/>
in doing this business with me, kindly find this mini-letterbox and <br/>
stamp in. When stamping, include your trail name and personal stamp <br/>
for easy verification.  From the Bridge of Bogert, continue 60 deg on <br/>
the trail of the South Bank until you find the last planet.  At tree <br/>
at 115 deg brings you closer, find from there a crossing point at 80 <br/>
deg.  Across this step across and you shall be rewarded behind a <br/>
stone of light tan along the bottom of the wall of stone. Thanks for <br/>
your anticipated [cooperation]. <br/>
<br/>
Yours faithfully,<br/>

working on narrowing down some mystery (or otherwise challenging) boxes, so <br/>
we got a good workout on the trails nonetheless. Here's what we found:<br/>
<br/>
Giant Peach<br/>
Hungry Termites<br/>
Jump for Joy<br/>
Catch the Wind<br/>
Great Blue Heron (where we picked up the Happy Duck Hitchhiker)<br/>
Who Is the Author? (all 6)<br/>
<br/>
All were in good shape<br/>
<br/>
I hit two milestones today -- ending the day exactly at F400, and reaching <br/>
PFX500 (<a href="http://alum.wpi.edu/~p_miner/Letterboxes.html#pfxclubs)" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://alum.wpi.edu/~p_miner/Letterboxes.html#pfxclubs)</a> on the <br/>
day's second letterbox.<br/>
<br/>
The day wasn't all good, though -- I got stung by a yellow jacket or bee at <br/>
the last box in the Who Is the Author series as I was putting the box back <br/>
in place. There may be a nest nearby or even in the box's hiding place, so <br/>
others should use caution there.<br/>

I was immediately suspicious of this when I read it.<br/>
I don't know you that well, but I smelled a polecat somewhere in the woods.<br/>
<br/>
Maybe I'll try to find that one on Monday if I get a minute.<br/>
<br/>
Hey, BTW, I carved a black capped chickadee on Friday (using Carmen's<br/>
tracing paper technique).  Came out pretty good if I may say so.<br/>
I am leaving Tuesday (back Thursday) for business travel and again next week<br/>
Tuesday through Friday.  Somehow we need to hook up for lunch to plant in<br/>
the Reimert Sanctuary.<br/>
<br/>
Keep in touch on this.<br/>
