You could always plant a decoy box for the mouse patrol to hunt that <br/>

Thanks for the advice all, I wil heed it well.  I may contact Natty off-list for some tips and tricks.<br/>
<br/>
Sameera- hopeflly they'll still be there when you and your family get there.<br/>
<br/>
I like the advice about including the article.  It'l be tough in a micro, but I'll give it a shot.<br/>
<br/>
I'll probably take a couple different boxes in, some magnetics, film canisters, pill bottles.  That way I'l have something for wherever I wanna plant.<br/>
<br/>
I forget what issue this was in the magazine, but I believe somone posted a link to the ad on this list.  Just do a search for 'suburban.'<br/>
<br/>
As far as me announcing my intentions publicly, 4suits, they can't really keep tabs on everything, can they? I mean, wait, what is that chanting outside?!?!<br/>

<br/>
It's been YEARS since I've been to Disney World, but if it hasn't <br/>
changed, Tom Sawyer Island is practically the only place in the park <br/>
that's still a little "wild" - I remember we were able to sneak out <br/>
behind the shack and into the woods a little bit there.  Perhaps <br/>
while you're there, you should give that a look as a possible <br/>
placement site!<br/>

&gt; If you do plant a box or two, I recommend you include a copy of the <br/>
Family Fun article (or at least the title and magazine issue date) <br/>
about LB and also info that it is owned by Disney, and a note that <br/>
therefore you think Disney has "sanctioned" letterboxing.  That way <br/>
if the mouseketeer security folks find it, they'll PERHAPS see the <br/>
message.<br/>

&gt; Subject: [lbma] Disney Invasion <br/>
&gt; To: <a href="mailto:lbma@yahoogroups.com" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">lbma@yahoogroups.com</a> <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; So, I managed to whangle a free trip to Orlando out of my company <br/>
&gt; &gt; in early September. It includes a trip to Disney World. <br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; Now, Family Fun magazine (owned by Disney) is notorious for <br/>
&gt; &gt; proselytizing our hobby, but won't allow any boxes in their park. <br/>
&gt; &gt; So I plan to plant one or two. <br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; I really could care less about the ethics on this one, I think <br/>
&gt; &gt; they crossed the line with the Suburban ad. I would just like <br/>
&gt; &gt; some imput from you, LBMA'ers, who are most esteemed and steeped <br/>
&gt; &gt; in LB lore. <br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; Should I plant it or just drop the idea? <br/>
&gt; &gt; -and- <br/>
&gt; &gt; If I am to plant, how to make it unfindable (or nearly so) by <br/>
&gt; &gt; crack Disney police? <br/>

would last more than a week. It has to be the most manicured place <br/>
on earth. I have heard of boxes outside the parks, but still on D. <br/>
area, like hotel land, that would be both interesting and D <br/>
specific. <br/>
<br/>
Besides that, I would personally magnet or velcro just a small stamp <br/>
only, no log, in a likely to be undisturbed place near and <br/>
commemorating the Pirates o. t. C. Seems appropriate, no? <br/>
