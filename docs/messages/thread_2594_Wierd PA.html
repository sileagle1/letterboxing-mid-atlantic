&gt; &gt; &gt; deserted trail in a local park when as we<br/>
&gt; crested<br/>
&gt; &gt; a hill we came upon a<br/>
&gt; &gt; large structure. It <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; would appear it was a home made log cabin. It<br/>
&gt; was<br/>
&gt; &gt; large maybe 15 feet<br/>
&gt; &gt; long and with several <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; rooms. It was not a square or rectangle but more<br/>
&gt; &gt; free form. <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; Mambo was a little freaked out(so was I, but<br/>
&gt; &gt; didn't want to alarm son). I<br/>
&gt; &gt; was afaid we had <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; stumbled on a secret drug hideawy or drinking<br/>
&gt; &gt; hangout. Mambo was afaid it<br/>
&gt; &gt; was a homeless <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; persons house(do homeless people have homes?)<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; We were way out at the highest elevation in the<br/>
&gt; &gt; park and far from any<br/>
&gt; &gt; road or trail head. <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; There was not alot of trash around, a little<br/>
&gt; &gt; broken glass. I did plant a<br/>
&gt; &gt; box not too far away, I <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; planted it before we saw the structure.<br/>
