Currently, I have 8 of the 26 letters needed. <br/><br/>Each stamp incorporated the letter into a letterbox themed image. Basically, an "alphabet book" on letterboxing. Some of the carvings are simple, others very elaborate. Also, they are all sizes up to 4"X6".<br/><br/>The Massanutten Trail runs in a loop in the Shenandoah Valley, and would be an excellent place to plant these.<br/><br/>More info on the trail here:<br/><a href="http://www.americantrails.org/nationalrecreationtrails/trailNRT/Massanutten-VA.html" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><font color="#1e66ae">http://www.american trails.org/ nationalrecreati ontrails/ trailNRT/ Massanutten- VA.html</font></a><br/><br/>I'm looking for carvers for the other letters. I currently have: D, J, L, M, Q, R, Y and Z.  (UPDATE: A, B, C and P have also been claimed now.)<br/><br/>You'll get credit as the carver--I'll do the hike (during the Fall and Winter), place the boxes and write the clues. I'll also take care of the logbook and container. The trail is almost in my backyard, so these won't be abandoned boxes.<br/><br/>Anyone interested? or have any questions?<br/><br/>Thanks,<br/>FamilyMan<br/></div></div><br/>
