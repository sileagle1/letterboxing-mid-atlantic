internet search, but will certainly be adding it to the backpack <br/>
tonight.  The backpack is beginning to look more like a travelling <br/>
medical kit.  With the abundant poison ivy in this region it may be a <br/>
good idea for others to pick up some of this wonderful lotion.<br/>

                    <div id="ygrps-yiv-1758268627"><div>With you so susceptible to poison ivy also consider the physical things you can do to prevent it.  Like wearing long pants, understanding that you can get it from petting a dog, and you can get it from touching the outside of clothes that came in contact.  I have heard of some people who carefully peel off their clothes after being in the woods and wash them right away.   The problem is it is an oil that can get on stuff and can then transfer around.  I think there are more such hints out there.</div>

</span></blockquote>It's made by the same folks as, yep, TecNu....<br/>
And TecNu also gets the resin off of clothing, but they never say <br/>
how much to use. I've just dumped it on like a prewash where I think <br/>
it's needed (like cuffs of jeans), spread it around, let it sit and <br/>
then thrown it in the wash, and it seems to work.<br/>
It's also good for getting pine pitch off of chain saws, but that's <br/>
another story...<br/>
