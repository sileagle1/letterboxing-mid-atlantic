Loose mountain lion a rare sight in Jersey <br/>
<br/>
Mahwah police confirm sighting near pond<br/>
<br/>
A mountain lion, a species of large cat that has not been seen in New <br/>
Jersey for more than 200 years, is being sought in Mahwah after <br/>
police officers and other witnesses saw it hunting geese and lounging <br/>
around a pond yesterday. <br/>
<br/>
Unsure whether the animal escaped from a private compound, was let <br/>
loose or is an amazing natural phenomenon, police called in the state <br/>
Division of Fish and Wildlife after confronting the cat about 3:15 <br/>
p.m. and watching it run into a forested area. State conservation <br/>
officers are monitoring the area on Route 17 where employees at a <br/>
Federal Express building first reported seeing the cougar earlier <br/>
this month.</div>
