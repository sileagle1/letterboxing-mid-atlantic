Very interesting.  Looks like each library did their own clues, some are <br/>
simple, others are more naritive, all look to be pretty easy.  May have <br/>

Well after a lttle scurrying around the box was found.<br/>
Inside were several commercial stamps. Oh well. We<br/>
were the only real boxers to have visited. I got the<br/>

will drop her a little note.<br/>
Just on the oft chance there was something different<br/>
at the Paoli library we ventured up the road. I was<br/>
actualy a little afraid they were using my box as this<br/>
library"s box. The library's box was just about 2 feet<br/>
from my box and no one from the library box had logged<br/>
into mine.<br/>

letterbox series. She has never been boxing. Here is the e-mail from her.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 Hi, Miz Scarlet!  Thanks for noticing our letterboxing project!  I've<br/>
never letterboxed personally, but I just might start now.  I had heard<br/>
about letterboxing and geo-caches in various ways and thought it was a<br/>
perfect fit for our Summer Reading Club theme -- Get a Clue.  With a<br/>
little tweaking, some poetic license and some unfortunate delays, this<br/>
is what we came up with.  The kids seem to be having fun with it.  I'm<br/>
planning to write up an article for a library publication, so we'll see<br/>
if we can spread the word a little further.  Thanks for your interest!<br/>
-- Jeanne		<br/>
<br/>
I sent her one back and asked her to contact me before she does anything else. Don't want to <br/>
start the pblicity vs no publicity thing again but I'm just not comfortable with this. i know we <br/>
will have some livley disscussion about this on sat.</div>

You are correct. Get a Clue is the National Summer Reading program for Libraries sponsored I believe by the ALA. My wife is the Children's Librarian in Lambertville, NJ and has done a huge amount of programming through the Get a CLue program. Each year there is a national theme and they have workshops as well as a binder of ideas. <br/>
<br/>
A Library Letterbox was one of the suggested activities particularly for teen readers. I personally think it is a great idea for this theme. I read over the suggestions in the binder and they all pretty much followed what I have learned on these boards. I have to check but I think it also recommended checking out LBNA and atlasquest FAQ's before planting. Unfortunately, I did not have the time to plant one for her so she did not have a box for the theme but will eventually:)<br/>
<br/>
Anyway just a little background for you.<br/>
