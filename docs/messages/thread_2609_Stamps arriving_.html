MSTRWNDL (TENN) &amp; MRS DGLVRS (Michigan). The theme has attracted some<br/>
attention from carvers we have not seen in NoVa... can't wait to see<br/>
what else is coming (You letterboxers are amazing people!) Expecting<br/>
more from here in Virginia the Carolinas, Texas and 2 or 3 from PA....<br/>
I was hoping to get a West Va entry... but have not heard (PI?)... and<br/>
if anybody sees Dr Hawley Griffin... I would be honored to feature one<br/>
of his amazing carvings! Thanks for volunteering... it's going to be a<br/>
fun event!</div>

for 0pt Nibs and MSTRWNDL replied and made me 2. He's now the <br/>
official "nib squeezer"- it's quite a funny thread! I've also seen a <br/>
few of his carvings in the Albums section of AQ- I can't wait to see <br/>
what he's done for the SWC. <br/>
Gallant- a msg at 1:30am? Do you have flex time on Friday's?? <br/>

If the pub crawl isn;t your thing we have two family friendly gathers coming up, Knoebels in Sept and Tyler "The Music Never Stopped" in Dec.
