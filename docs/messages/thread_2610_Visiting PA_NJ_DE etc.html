<div><font face="Arial" size="2">There aren't a lot of drive-bys in Northern 
Delaware, but Lil' Red Racer is always good.  Ditto for Don't Panic!, which 
is within sight of I-95.  Just Passin' Through is very close I-95, but 
requires a short walk, as do all of the Rockwood Park boxes.  Rockwood has 
fun clues, if I do say so myself, but three of the five carves are done by 
kids.  The Yummy!  box is the best carve in that park and a nice box, 
too.  There is at least one Delaware mystery that requires no hiking, 
is a couple of miles from a major highway and can be solved 
before you come by doing some web searching, but I'll not tell any more about 
that!</font></div>

I'm thinking Sunday evening may be the best time for a "how-de-do" as <br/>
Mrs Jiggs and the Jigglets want to spend Mon in Philly, so timings will <br/>
be pretty fluid. LMK what you think.  I think someones mentioned <br/>
they're from or near Bensalem so may have a good idea for a meeting <br/>
spot...<br/>

the way to Hawley, PA on the 18th.  Probably around mid-day ish.  <br/>
Perhaps the old paths will cross.<br/>
<br/>
Contact me offline and perhaps we can set something up.<br/>
<br/>
Sadly, along the route you seem to be chosing, there are very few <br/>
driveby's except for a few by John Pujeh in Allentown, Zuflucht Haus <br/>
in Emmaus and the Laubach Park Blackberries SE of Allentown.  <br/>
Everything else pretty much requires a walk of varying duration.<br/>

<br/>
If you are spending some time in Bensalem we must get together for some <br/>
boxing.  Perhaps breakfast one morning.  I am in Bristol and you are <br/>
more then welcome to come on by for some breakfast or lunch, there are <br/>
some very nice boxes in the area (an no, not all are mine ;-)  I am sure <br/>
we can get a small group together one morning to greet you, like Sheba <br/>
and Team Radetoan.<br/>
<br/>
If you and the Jiglets are going to be in Downtown Philadelphia I would <br/>
suggest searching this list for a few WOM boxes, including Freedom Trail <br/>
#1 and #2 and Chaos at the Zoo.  FT #1 maybe missing, but it was dark <br/>
when I went looking again for it and simply may not have been able to <br/>
see it.<br/>
<br/>
Stop by the Bucks County Visitor's Center in Bensalem and say hello to <br/>
my mother (Janet, she will be in the new Peddler's Village location on <br/>
Monday, and is off Wednesday), and take a look around, you may be <br/>
surprised what you find.  They have all sorts of information on things <br/>
to do in the area, as well as all the local State Park Trail maps, the <br/>
one for Tyler may be very useful  if you wish to tackle the 40+ boxes there.<br/>

left.  There is a little used trail the moves along the ridge.  Maybe <br/>
100 feet in you should find the boulder that the box is hidden under.  <br/>
Here is a picture of the boulder:<br/>

<br/>
The park has no map or information on the pothole there (very <br/>
disappointing really) so be sure to check out the park's website before <br/>
you go to learn about what you are actually looking at:<br/>

&gt; &gt; There's a RedHat box in Archbald Pothole S. P.  Which I still<br/>
think is <br/>
&gt; &gt; near there.  There are sketchy clues in one of the messages on this <br/>
&gt; &gt; list if you're interested, also Cyclonic &amp; Pink Panther found it &amp; <br/>
&gt; &gt; might have taken notes if they thought about it at the time....<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; *//*<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; OK, from the pothole you go up the hill behind it and at the top veer <br/>
&gt; left.  There is a little used trail the moves along the ridge.  Maybe <br/>
&gt; 100 feet in you should find the boulder that the box is hidden under.  <br/>
&gt; Here is a picture of the boulder:<br/>

&gt; <br/>
&gt; The park has no map or information on the pothole there (very <br/>
&gt; disappointing really) so be sure to check out the park's website before <br/>
&gt; you go to learn about what you are actually looking at:<br/>

<br/>
The cassette tape is in the under the passenger seat. Or did HnH burn <br/>
that with Tony Tony Chopper at FC in a burninator experiment?<br/>
<br/>
My version of clues: Up the trail behind Pothole. Veer right on small <br/>
trail. (After checking the open fields in the distance. "Listen" to <br/>
man say "Don't reach under rocks, I hear snakes". Hear woman say "But <br/>
why, I found it?" Laugh and giggle. Stamp in. Repeat.<br/>
<br/>
Do look up the park. I was grateful Nathan had done research and <br/>
could explain the Pothole to me. It was cool. It is a shame there is <br/>
not even a sign or board there at the Park explaining the <br/>
significance of the Pothole.<br/>
