a log book is full, do you take it and replace with another new logbook <br/>
(then contact owner so you can mail it to them)? This was not the case <br/>
with any log books but one was pretty close. Also, if I swap out <br/>
logbooks, what if the planter has a beautiful hand-made one and mine is <br/>
all generic? So question- swap or leave?<br/>
<br/>
Second Question:<br/>
One box was swapped with Geocache stuff- they even logged it (I know, <br/>
it broke my heart too). It kind of made me laugh though, the note said <br/>
they loved the stamp so they are leaving two mini-stamps in its place. <br/>
Now with this box, do I take it so I can mail it to the owner, or just <br/>
leave it? In this case I left it. The geocache is less than 5 ft away <br/>
and I'd hate for a future letterboxer to go hunting and walk away <br/>
without finding the letterbox and instead gets some geocache box.<br/>

Anywho, these are my two questions. Anyone have an answer? (Oh, if this <br/>

You leave the logbook, notify the owner of the box that it's full or almost<br/>
full, whatever the case. It's their responsibility to replace it. Or not.<br/>
If you know that they live far away, you could offer to mail it to them and<br/>

<br/>
The geocachers TOOK the original stamp and left two in it's place??!! Let<br/>
the owner of the box know what happened. That sucks. <br/>
<br/>
This is why geocachers are our idiot, distant relatives. Taking a stamp is<br/>
a big NONO. <br/>

discover where the swap was made. It sounded like a family when <br/>
searching, they had 2 little boys; they loved the stamp and thought <br/>
they should leave a few in its place. So again, cute, but. . . I <br/>
really wanted the real stamp. Besides, the geocache was planted well <br/>
after the letterbox. I found the geo first (and did look inside- what <br/>
crap! Cereal bx toys, handy wipes!, stickers, stuff you throw out <br/>
when you are cleaning that drawer that we all have that stuff just <br/>
gets thrown into but we never get rid of the things in it). <br/>
After a few minutes I found the Letterbox. Inside were several notes <br/>
saying it's not the geocache- keep looking, etc. But, some folks <br/>
don't read everything in a box (I do- in case there's a bonus). <br/>

&gt; The logbook thing happens alot. I try to carry extra paer or even <br/>
3x5 card logs in my pack for this reason. If the book is full and <br/>
there is enough room for both, I just add the new blank logbook, if <br/>
there's not enough room for both I will replace withte blank and <br/>
contact the placer for an address to return their original to. Either <br/>
way contact the placer.<br/>

&gt; Okay, so I am out today boxing (of course) and had a few questions. <br/>
If <br/>
&gt; a log book is full, do you take it and replace with another new <br/>
logbook <br/>
&gt; (then contact owner so you can mail it to them)? This was not the <br/>
case <br/>
&gt; with any log books but one was pretty close. Also, if I swap out <br/>
&gt; logbooks, what if the planter has a beautiful hand-made one and <br/>
mine is <br/>
&gt; all generic? So question- swap or leave?<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Second Question:<br/>
&gt; One box was swapped with Geocache stuff- they even logged it (I <br/>
know, <br/>
&gt; it broke my heart too). It kind of made me laugh though, the note <br/>
said <br/>
&gt; they loved the stamp so they are leaving two mini-stamps in its <br/>
place. <br/>
&gt; Now with this box, do I take it so I can mail it to the owner, or <br/>
just <br/>
&gt; leave it? In this case I left it. The geocache is less than 5 ft <br/>
away <br/>
&gt; and I'd hate for a future letterboxer to go hunting and walk away <br/>
&gt; without finding the letterbox and instead gets some geocache box.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Anywho, these are my two questions. Anyone have an answer? (Oh, if <br/>
this <br/>
&gt; turns out to be a flame war- SORRY FOR ASKING! I just want to do <br/>
right <br/>
&gt; in the eyes of the majority). <br/>

 Welllllll, no it's not "cute". You don't take a stamp from a box. Period. Family or not, cute kids or not. Can you imagine how you would feel if you spent hours carving a stamp, and some of us do just that, and then someone took it because they thought it was cute? And left some kind of crap or commercial stamp in it's place? That stamp will probably wind up under some kid's bed trapped in dust bunnies. <br/><br/>It's something you just <em>do not do.</em> You don't take a stamp from a letterbox.

                    <div id="ygrps-yiv-1019327862">I agree completely w/not taking stamps. The folks that took the stamp <br/>
though thought it was a geocache 'trinket' and didn't know any <br/>
better. Also, I truly do feel horrible for the carver and planter- <br/>
They're really great and nice- I've written them back and forth a few <br/>
times- I hated telling them what happened. <br/>
My very first stamp, which was going to be my signature stamp and is <br/>
now a personal traveler, snapped and broke in the corner (1/3 of the <br/>
stamp broke off). It's too big for a sig. stamp anyway and was pretty <br/>
bad, but still, I was crushed. I tried gluing it and adding a backing <br/>
so it works, but how long will it last? No idea- This was my first <br/>
stamp though so hopefully it'll last a bit longer. <br/>
Bottom line, I've dried out wet boxes, replace a busted box (it took <br/>
2 weeks until I got back out there, but it got done), I've replaced <br/>
countless baggies, I write everyone after boxes are found and let <br/>
them know the condition, I leave no TRASH (see main board), wipe <br/>
backs of stamps after stamping in(with unscented wipes), plant better <br/>
than found, even replant where it was supposed to be- 1 was close but <br/>
not where it was supposed to be- and let the owner know just in <br/>
case. . .I really am trying my best to do this great hobby justice. I <br/>
don't want to be one of those boxers that some might roll their eyes <br/>
or shake their heads at. I understand your last email as anger <br/>
towards the geocachers and not me- I just hope you and other <br/>
understand too that I don't agree with what they did but I do see why <br/>
they did it.<br/>

Too funny! I would have if I wasn't worried some hero-type wouldn't <br/>
come bounding out of the trees trying to find out if something was <br/>
wrong. I wrote down the exact message the geocachers wrote, date, and <br/>
log name- plan to check the geo sites after this and email- it was in <br/>
May when it was switched. I am hopeful though- I'd love to be the <br/>
hero in this story and save the stamp!<br/>

together, someone's gonna have to move or this will continue to <br/>
happen.  That's up to the placer, though.<br/>

&gt;           Okay, so I am out today boxing (of course) and had a few <br/>
questions. If <br/>
&gt; a log book is full, do you take it and replace with another new <br/>
logbook <br/>
&gt; (then contact owner so you can mail it to them)? This was not the <br/>
case <br/>
&gt; with any log books but one was pretty close. Also, if I swap out <br/>
&gt; logbooks, what if the planter has a beautiful hand-made one and <br/>
mine is <br/>
&gt; all generic? So question- swap or leave?<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Second Question:<br/>
&gt; One box was swapped with Geocache stuff- they even logged it (I <br/>
know, <br/>
&gt; it broke my heart too). It kind of made me laugh though, the note <br/>
said <br/>
&gt; they loved the stamp so they are leaving two mini-stamps in its <br/>
place. <br/>
&gt; Now with this box, do I take it so I can mail it to the owner, or <br/>
just <br/>
&gt; leave it? In this case I left it. The geocache is less than 5 ft <br/>
away <br/>
&gt; and I'd hate for a future letterboxer to go hunting and walk away <br/>
&gt; without finding the letterbox and instead gets some geocache box.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Anywho, these are my two questions. Anyone have an answer? (Oh, if <br/>
this <br/>
&gt; turns out to be a flame war- SORRY FOR ASKING! I just want to do <br/>
right <br/>
&gt; in the eyes of the majority). <br/>

&gt;<br/>
&gt; I agree completely w/not taking stamps. The folks that took the stamp <br/>
&gt; though thought it was a geocache 'trinket' and didn't know any <br/>
&gt; better. Also, I truly do feel horrible for the carver and planter- <br/>
&gt; They're really great and nice- I've written them back and forth a few <br/>
&gt; times- I hated telling them what happened. <br/>
&gt; My very first stamp, which was going to be my signature stamp and is <br/>
&gt; now a personal traveler, snapped and broke in the corner (1/3 of the <br/>
&gt; stamp broke off). It's too big for a sig. stamp anyway and was pretty <br/>
&gt; bad, but still, I was crushed. I tried gluing it and adding a backing <br/>
&gt; so it works, but how long will it last? No idea- This was my first <br/>
&gt; stamp though so hopefully it'll last a bit longer. <br/>
&gt; Bottom line, I've dried out wet boxes, replace a busted box (it took <br/>
&gt; 2 weeks until I got back out there, but it got done), I've replaced <br/>
&gt; countless baggies, I write everyone after boxes are found and let <br/>
&gt; them know the condition, I leave no TRASH (see main board), wipe <br/>
&gt; backs of stamps after stamping in(with unscented wipes), plant better <br/>
&gt; than found, even replant where it was supposed to be- 1 was close but <br/>
&gt; not where it was supposed to be- and let the owner know just in <br/>
&gt; case. . .I really am trying my best to do this great hobby justice. I <br/>
&gt; don't want to be one of those boxers that some might roll their eyes <br/>
&gt; or shake their heads at. I understand your last email as anger <br/>
&gt; towards the geocachers and not me- I just hope you and other <br/>
&gt; understand too that I don't agree with what they did but I do see why <br/>
&gt; they did it.<br/>

&gt; &gt; Welllllll, no it's not "cute". You don't take a stamp from a box. <br/>
&gt; Period. Family or not, cute kids or not. Can you imagine how you <br/>
&gt; would feel if you spent hours carving a stamp, and some of us do just <br/>
&gt; that, and then someone took it because they thought it was cute? And <br/>
&gt; left some kind of crap or commercial stamp in it's place? That stamp <br/>
&gt; will probably wind up under some kid's bed trapped in dust bunnies. <br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; It's something you just do not do. You don't take a stamp from a <br/>
&gt; letterbox. This is something I for one take very seriously, and I <br/>
&gt; think other boxers do as well. I appreciate that you ask these <br/>
&gt; questions. Lots of people just start boxing and don't bother to find <br/>
&gt; out anything. <br/>

logging their finds on-line.  You or the planter simply need to <br/>
create a user ID on the geocache site, find the listing for the <br/>
nearby cache, and try to determine who the "guilty" parties are.  <br/>
They may well still have the stamp and would probably be happy to <br/>
return it if the situation were explained to them!<br/>
<br/>
Here's the link to their official site to get you started, or to pass <br/>
on the the placer:  <a href="http://www.geocaching.com/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.geocaching.com/</a><br/>
