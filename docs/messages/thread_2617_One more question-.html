&gt; &gt; Ca't help here, I don't log finds. I just like to stumble aoubt in <br/>
&gt; the woods, occasionally find a box and stamp it into my logbook. I <br/>
&gt; don't count. But there are lots of folks here who do so they can <br/>
&gt; assist. Honestly, just do what you feel like doing.  No one will ever <br/>
&gt; ask you to verify anything. Which is why I have 2million finds I <br/>
&gt; think....<br/>

She came home smelling of sweat, other dog or dogs (smelled a little like a beagle/dachsund mix? Or perhaps one of each?) and of course...beer. That can only mean she was off letterboxing without me again. The man and I are quite upset with her. She never called to check in to see if I was okay and came traipsing in when it was dark and late. The man reminded her that she does have a dog who loves her and worries when she doesn't check in (although he mis-pronounced dog, sounded like mouse or souse or something).</div> <div> </div> <div>I have no one but myself to blame. She was paying far too much attention to her red tabby with the idiotic name of Gus, so I decided a little play acting was in order and pretended to limp to get some hugs and sympathy. Next thing I know she shoves a baby aspirin down my throat and says "You stay home and rest honey, we'll do
 something together when your feeling better" and out the door she goes. I barked and jumped to show her I was just kidding but I believe she chose to ignore my miraculous recovery.</div> <div> </div> <div>I hope she didn't like those new sandals she just bought too awfully much....they sure tasted good!  <br/></div> <div>DWD<br/><b><i>JuneMcAllister &lt;nfmoon@...&gt;</i></b> wrote:</div> <blockquote><span title="qreply"> <blockquote class="ygrps-yiv-1768555494replbq" style="PADDING-LEFT:5px;MARGIN-LEFT:5px;BORDER-LEFT:#1010ff 2px solid;"> <div id="ygrps-yiv-1768555494ygrp-text"> <div>Dude??? !! lol <br/><br/>missmoon<br/><br/>&gt; [Original Message]<br/>&gt; From: Lightnin Bug &lt;<a href="mailto:rpboehme%40yahoo.com" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">rpboehme@yahoo. com</a>&gt;<br/>&gt; To: &lt;<a href="mailto:lbma%40yahoogroups.com" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">lbma@yahoogroups. com</a>&gt;<br/>&gt; Date: 8/12/2007 5:42:27 PM<br/>&gt; Subject: [lbma] Re: One more question-<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Dude, you're going all main list on us. ;-)<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; "No cooties for you!" :-P<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; LB<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; --- In <a href="mailto:lbma%40yahoogroups.com" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">lbma@yahoogroups. com</a>, "JuneMcAllister" &lt;nfmoon@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; you and wanda. heh <br/>&gt; &gt; <br/>&gt; &gt; <br/>&gt; &gt; ----- Original Message ----- <br/>&gt; &gt; From: Hikers and Hounds <br/>&gt; &gt; To: <a href="mailto:lbma%40yahoogroups.com" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">lbma@yahoogroups. com</a><br/>&gt; &gt; Sent: 8/12/2007 4:19:17 PM <br/>&gt; &gt; Subject: Re: [lbma] One more question-<br/>&gt; &gt; <br/>&gt; &gt; <br/>&gt; &gt; Ca't help here, I don't log finds.
