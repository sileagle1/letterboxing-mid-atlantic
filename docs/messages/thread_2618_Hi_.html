                    <div id="ygrps-yiv-1653930618">Just wanted to take a moment to introduce myself. I live in Delaware <br/>
and have been letterboxing for about a year and a half. I also <br/>
geocache. <br/>
<br/>
Not in defense of geocachers that take stamps, just maybe an <br/>
explanation. These may also be the same geocachers that other <br/>
geocachers complain about. They are new to the sport, unaware of <br/>
letterboxing and not really paying attention to the rules. They can <br/>
also leave trash in the box and not hide it properly. In otherwords, <br/>
don't dump all geocachers into one catagory. Trust me, we are really <br/>
nice people. Yes, there are a few bad apples, probably in both <br/>
sports. So ease up or you'll make me sad. <br/>
<br/>
I geocache because there are a lot around me. I letterbox because I <br/>
like to hike in the woods. Both are treasure hunts. I really enjoy <br/>
both equally. <br/>
<br/>
There is an issue of where you place a box. If you want to safe guard <br/>
your box, join geocaching.com and watch the placement of boxes near <br/>
yours. It's very easy to do. There are maps, one that can bring up <br/>
all the geocaches in an area. You can get an idea of how close they <br/>
are to your box and whether you need to check on it more often. Also <br/>
gives you a quick way of locating a geocacher that takes your stamp. <br/>
Nearly all geocachers log in. You could also email me and I would <br/>
check the area for you. <br/>
<br/>
I know there are letterboxers here in Delaware but I haven't met any <br/>
yet. I did try to get a little help from someone about one of his <br/>
boxes, but his response was not very helpful. Do letterboxers help <br/>
when someone has trouble with clues or is that just not done? Just <br/>
wondering. I haven't tried asking anyone else, now I just put it in a <br/>
list of "forget about it, maybe someday". Really, that's my heading. <br/>
As for logging my finds, I really do that for myself, to keep track <br/>
of what I've done and what I need to do. Sometimes I email the owner <br/>
when I find a box, I know I should but just don't always think of it.<br/>
<br/>
Perhaps I can get to an event. I'll be on the lookout. <br/>

happen.<br/>
Don't forget PA is not that far awa and there are a<br/>
few gathers comming up.<br/>
As for geo-cachers vs. boxers, I think we need to<br/>
learn about each other. We use the same resources,<br/>
meaning parks. It shouldn't be us againt them.<br/>
As for placers some will respond and some won't. I<br/>
always respond even if it's only to say keep trying.<br/>

I live in Delaware <br/>and have been letterboxing for about a year and a half. I also <br/>geocache. <br/><br/>Not in defense of geocachers that take stamps, just maybe an <br/>explanation. These may also be the same geocachers that other <br/>geocachers complain about. They are new to the sport, unaware of <br/>letterboxing and not really paying attention to the rules. They can <br/>also leave trash in the box and not hide it properly. In otherwords, <br/>don't dump all geocachers into one catagory. Trust me, we are really <br/>nice people. Yes, there are a few bad apples, probably in both <br/>sports. So
 ease up or you'll make me sad. <br/><br/>I geocache because there are a lot around me. I letterbox because I <br/>like to hike in the woods. Both are treasure hunts. I really enjoy <br/>both equally. <br/><br/>There is an issue of where you place a box. If you want to safe guard <br/>your box, join geocaching.com and watch the placement of boxes near <br/>yours. It's very easy to do. There are maps, one that can bring up <br/>all the geocaches in an area. You can get an idea of how close they <br/>are to your box and whether you need to check on it more often. Also <br/>gives you a quick way of locating a geocacher that takes your stamp. <br/>Nearly all geocachers log in. You could also email me and I would <br/>check the area for you. <br/><br/>I know there are letterboxers here in Delaware but I haven't met any <br/>yet. I did try to get a little help from someone about one of his <br/>boxes, but his response was not very helpful. Do letterboxers help <br/>when someone has trouble with
 clues or is that just not done? Just <br/>wondering. I haven't tried asking anyone else, now I just put it in a <br/>list of "forget about it, maybe someday". Really, that's my heading. <br/>As for logging my finds, I really do that for myself, to keep track <br/>of what I've done and what I need to do. Sometimes I email the owner <br/>when I find a box, I know I should but just don't always think of it.<br/><br/>Perhaps I can get to an event. I'll be on the lookout. <br/><br/>jillalexandria <br/><br/></div></div></blockquote><br/><p>
