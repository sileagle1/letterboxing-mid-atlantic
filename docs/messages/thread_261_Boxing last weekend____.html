River Trail II.<br/>
<br/>
Kayak is an easy jaunt into the woods that left none of the smokers <br/>
gasping or clutching their side.<br/>
<br/>
Yough River Trail II, However, is another story.<br/>
<br/>
The clues can be found in the Letterbox Basement group.<br/>
<br/>
Find some place to rent a bike - it will go much better for you.<br/>
<br/>
We drove as close as we could and ended up walking a mile downhill <br/>
and a mile flat.<br/>
<br/>
Then a mile flat back then started the mile trek uphill and hitched a <br/>
ride with a bus that carries rafters up the hill.<br/>
<br/>
The box is fine - but only about 5 people have stamped in before us <br/>
and it's been there for 2 years.  The stamp is okay - and a 5 mile <br/>
bike ride along the trail would be very pleasant.  It's a flat gravel <br/>
path that goes along the river.<br/>
