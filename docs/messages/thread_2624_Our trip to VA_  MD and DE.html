Jamestown this time! We spent Friday at Busch Gardens (very hot <br/>
temperatures!). Then Saturday we went down to the Jamestown Village <br/>
area. Very neat setup. No letterboxes but I did get acouple of <br/>
elongated pennies. The next morning we headed for NJ by way of <br/>
Hampton and the Eastern Shore. We decided to get breakfast at Marker <br/>
20 and met the planter and her group out side the restaurant. We were <br/>
about to go back to the car for the clue sheet, when PWalker noticed <br/>
the LBMA patch on my fanny-pack! We got an exchange a very good <br/>
breakfast and a Letterbox! Not only that she told us that the Blue <br/>
Skies Gallery was just around the corner. Got that one,too. On to the <br/>
bridge/tunnel and the Eastern Shore boxes. We were running out of <br/>
travel time so we limited our searches to Crucified Crab, YinYang and <br/>
Sunset. Picked up 2 more HH's! On to Maryland State Crustacean and <br/>
another HH! Wow, 9 stamps in 1 day! We haven't had #'s like that <br/>
since Dave's been on Active Duty! Especially HH's, they've been few <br/>
and far between lately - guess we have to carve some more.<br/>
Dave has an actual Leave scheduled, so we're going north this time. <br/>
At least two of our boxes need maintenance. Perhaps we'll find more <br/>
HH's!<br/>
See you on the trail!<br/>
