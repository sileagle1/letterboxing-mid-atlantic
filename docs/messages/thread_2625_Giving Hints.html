I know there are letterboxers here in Delaware but I haven't met any <br/>
yet. I did try to get a little help from someone about one of his <br/>
boxes, but his response was not very helpful. Do letterboxers help <br/>
when someone has trouble with clues or is that just not done<br/>

&gt; I really do agree and would never want it handed to me. But as you <br/>

&gt; for. Did not want the location of the box. Yes, this one is tricky. <br/>
&gt; But I'm not in this to be frustrated. So after a half dozen tries and <br/>
&gt; no find, obviously I'm not going to find it without that hint. What <br/>

Our challenge is with those who email and expect a less than 24 hour <br/>
notice with exact directions to a box that has cryptic clues <br/>
(sometimes not so cryptic too).  Some are map-challenged, and no <br/>
matter what help we give, they never find it. Fortunately, this <br/>
hasn't happened too much.<br/>
<br/>
We have found it incredibly helpful to have friendly alumni LBers <br/>
who routinely find our boxes.  If they can find it without much <br/>

clues make sense and the box can be found.  We haven't done any <br/>
extremely difficult mystery boxes yet, but I am sure we will.<br/>
