Letterboxing withdrawal is ended! Gwenllian and I were able to hit <br/>
both Graeme Park boxes in the hour between meeting and party on Sat., <br/>
then went on to take my sister-in-law with us to Who is the Author? <br/>
after the party. We didn't have as much time as hoped for, so we <br/>
weren't able to get up to Peace Valley, but we really enjoyed the Who <br/>
is the Author Series. I think we have another boxer in our ranks, <br/>
too! SIL loved it and wants to go again.<br/>
<br/>
Our weekend of boxing is not over! As soon as I get off work, we are <br/>
taking off to (finally) pick up The Watcher! Should be a beautiful <br/>
afternoon to be outside and we are really looking forward to finding <br/>
this one!<br/>
<br/>
Happy boxing, everyone!<br/>
