quick environmental activism:<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
As many of you know, a 45-acre land parcel known as the âShyrock <br/>
propertyâ, situated between the terminus of the Struble Trail and <br/>
the Marsh Creek dam in Downingtown, was sold to a developer about two <br/>
years ago.  Since that time, the owner has fenced the property and <br/>
felled trees along the end of the Struble Trail to prevent âthe <br/>
publicâ from accessing his property.  As you know, the ownersâ <br/>
actions have prevented access on the Brandywine Trail from Marsh <br/>
Creek State Park to the Struble Trail at Dorlanâs Mill Road.<br/>
<br/>
In the meantime the developer has been in numerous battles with <br/>
township and state officials in efforts to get his project underway.  <br/>
The township and our state representatives have blocked progress in <br/>
this regard to the point that now the developer has put the land on <br/>
the market for sale.<br/>
<br/>
This email is to ask you to write, call, fax, or email our officials <br/>
urging them to purchase this land and annex it to Marsh Creek State <br/>
Park, to preserve it for public use, before some other developer <br/>
comes along to buy the parcel.<br/>
<br/>
This is an urgent request.  Please take a few minutes to contact one <br/>
or all of the officials listed below, and anyone else you think <br/>
appropriate, to make our voices heard to ensure that this land will <br/>
continue to be available for our use and for generations to come.<br/>
