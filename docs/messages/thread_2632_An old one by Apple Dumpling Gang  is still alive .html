Gang, "South Mountain Trinity."  The logbook was nearing the pulp <br/>
stage so I took the whole thing home and dried it out the best I <br/>
could.  Many of the stamps are obliterated, but most of the notes have <br/>
survived in this 2002 logbook.  So if you're near Gathland State Park <br/>
in Maryland looking for something else that is terrific, one box of <br/>
this historic series is now back in place and still alive with some <br/>
new ziplocks.  Great stamp!  I'm sure Box #1 is long long gone, and I <br/>
certainly looked for Box #3 and couldn't find a trace [last mentioned <br/>
to be found in 2005].<br/>
<br/>
And btw, you can find Box #2 for sure, but you're going to have to <br/>
think where certain things would have been five years ago, because <br/>
some things have changed...<br/>
<br/>
But if "I" can find it, so can you!<br/>

</span></blockquote>Whoa, what a flashback. This is the series where Chuck decided there <br/>
was more to letterboxing than chauffering Clair de Lune and I from hike <br/>
to hike and holding the umbrella to keep us dry as we stamped in on a <br/>
sodden New Years Day 2003. One look at Sarah's excellent carvings and <br/>
Dead Duck Chuck was hatched. I carved him a sig stamp and his first <br/>
true find was Scarab's Ant Castle Tree in Sarasota on Jan. 25th.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for the memories. I celebrated my 5-year lb anniversary last <br/>
month.<br/>
