Thanks to all who responded to our request for clues etc. If all goes <br/>
well, we'll be able to meet up with a least a few of you<br/>
<br/>
We're looking forward to trying those DE/DC boxes!<br/>

Hopefully we can get together, although Mrs Jiggs is eying the casino <br/>
right next door...:)<br/>

having trouble accessing it lately but the gather is moving forward!  We have about 30<br/>
stamps in or coming in. (more are always welcome!)  The historical society and many<br/>
shopkeepers are excited about taking part and the Castle B&amp;B has a Murder Mystery Dinner<br/>
theatre lined up for anyone interested in an evening event.  <br/>
<br/>
Gather food will be some halloween treats and snackage as well as chili to combat any<br/>
cold weather.  <br/>
<br/>
I know its a trek but I hope to see lots of you make it out there!  If anyone needs help<br/>
with hotels or arrangements please feel free to email  justplaingeorge AT yahoo.com.  The<br/>
Castle B&amp;B still has one room available.  Right now I think the place is all<br/>
letterboxers. :)<br/>
<br/>
Also, I was recently told that a letterboxing murder mystery I'd written was accepted<br/>
into an anthology coming out probably around January.  It's called Chesapeake Crimes III.<br/>

Shell<br/>
Knights of Columbo<br/>

Went 0 for 3 on boxes today.. Flat Tire's Whitney Point and PA rest <br/>
Stop boxes are missing and presumed toast, as is Cyclonic's Challenge <br/>
box in Pittston. Was going to try for Silent Doug's series of three (2 <br/>
still there??) in Scranton tonite, but the way the day went and the <br/>
lack of a response from him when I queried whether the boxes were <br/>
still there, I figured discretion took the better part of valour.<br/>
<br/>
Soooo.. we'll be at the Holiday Inn in Bensalem tomorrow around 6 ish. <br/>
Was hoping to pick up the two park boxes in Bensalem at the very <br/>
least...<br/>
<br/>
Please pass it on  or leave a message with the hotel for John Gauthier <br/>
(that's me, though I go by Pete... Canadian thing, eh? :)<br/>
<br/>
Cheers, Jiggs<br/>
