pinnacle/pulpit rock hike-- i had a crazy week, and wasn't online <br/>
until today.  I went to NYC on Sunday, so I would not have been able <br/>
to go anyway.  Hope you had fun!  Now I have three more boxes to <br/>
find!!  <br/>
I spent saturday letterboxing with my dad, brother and nephew-- <br/>
here's what we found:<br/>
Hungry Termites  (where we picked up the Crazy Duck HH)<br/>
Jump for Joy<br/>
Great Blue Heron (where we picked up the Tired Polar Bear HH)<br/>
<br/>
While we were out stampin' up, the creator of the box "the cichlid <br/>
guy" found us.  He was just out checking his box, at we just happened <br/>
to be there.  Nice guy and great exchange stamp!! And Ryan if you <br/>
need someone to adopt your box, let me know. <br/>
<br/>
On Sunday, before the trip-- I was able to do a little boxing in <br/>
Allentown. Dad and I found:<br/>
<br/>
The rose garden (picked up the flying squirrel HH)<br/>
pass-set-spike<br/>
<br/>
Dad went on to find, without me :( -<br/>
rodale fitness park<br/>
pool wildlife sanctuary (2 stamps) and he found a HH there too! <br/>
(can't remember which one though)<br/>
<br/>
So all in all it was F12 X1-- another good weekend.<br/>

Not a problem at all.  Eagle Bob and I figured that you were out of <br/>
town or some such.  Glad you guys could find the Allentown boxes and <br/>
had fun, and now there is a new one placed by a mysterious man on the <br/>
run from authorities in his homeland....<br/>
<br/>
There may be other challenges awaiting.  Mount Minsi is another <br/>
tougher hike with a couple boxes (maybe three) atop it.<br/>
