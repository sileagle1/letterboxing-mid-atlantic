Last week I was letterboxing in Fox Mill District Park, aka Fred <br/>
Crabtree Park in Reston. I found a letterbox (not the one I was looking <br/>
for)- it was in a black container and clear top and written on the top <br/>
was "Letterbox #1- Sprouting from the Ground". Inside was a foam-style <br/>
stamp and a soaked log book. It may have been planted in Jan 2006; <br/>
someone logged the find at that time: "Grizzly". <br/>
I've checked AQ and Lbx.org for this box or the box finder, nothing. <br/>
Anyone heard of this box? I found it by sheer luck- it was in a pile of <br/>
bark and wood from a stump that was ground down recently. <br/>
Just curious about the stamp- anyone have any info on it or have you <br/>
found this stamp?</div>
