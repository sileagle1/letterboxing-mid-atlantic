<div><font face="Arial" size="2">The brood and I were planning an outing and I'd

It's a Wanda &amp; Pete mystery box series - apparently, there are Mts. <br/>
Misery in 3 different states and W&amp;P have placed a box on each.  You <br/>
have to figure out where they are and which clue goes with which <br/>
mountain.<br/>

mentioned the Wanda and Pete box, but there are others as well.  Look <br/>
for clues for the following:<br/>
<br/>
Mount Misery (yes, this is a second one)<br/>
Treason!<br/>
Another Covered Bridge<br/>
Shall We Dance<br/>
<br/>
All of these boxes are within 500 feet of each other at the top of the <br/>
"mountain."<br/>
<br/>
The box with the statue picture is Baron Von Steuben, and sadly, it has <br/>
gone missing.  There are plans to replace it.  The clue can be found here:<br/>

<br/>
Good luck, it is a really nice hike with some terrific boxes at the end.<br/>
