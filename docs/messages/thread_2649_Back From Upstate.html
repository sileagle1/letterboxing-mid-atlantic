<div><font size="2">I made the trek up to the annual WNY gathering this weekend and had a pretty cool time. The Chestridge County Park in Orchard Park NY is a totally cool and huge park, with lots of boxes, both oldish and new. I wish it was closer. </font></div>

<div>I enjoying seeing several people I hadn't seen in a while and saw ::::lots:::::  and :::lots::::: of people who looked really new. I didn't hang around for the night boxing because it's a long drive back, almost always made longer by traffic foul-ups. But I had a good weekend in the far western regions of the Empire State. I could have gone over into Canada, eh? </div>
