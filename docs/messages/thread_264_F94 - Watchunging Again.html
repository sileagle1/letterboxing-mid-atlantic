And your number was way off.<br/>
I have learned that if there is a spot in NJ that deserves a box, it <br/>
probably already has one, but the odds are about 1 in 5 that it's a <br/>
mystery box (and probably a PCLG box). Which sometimes isn't <br/>
noticed, so regular boxes get planted there too. I know of 5 parks <br/>
with one of each, 1 with two of each, 1 with two regulars and one <br/>
mystery, 1 with two regulars and three mysteries, and my favorite- 1 <br/>
has both a state and a national mystery. The agony of "Wait! I know <br/>
where that is... and I was JUST THERE!"<br/>
And of course there could be more duplication where I haven't <br/>
cracked the clue yet.<br/>

post the clues, a series of unfortunate incidents as well as the plans I <br/>
had in mind for a more interesting clue. Finally, I tossed it all aside <br/>
since the box had been sitting in the park all that time, completely <br/>
clueless, and threw together the zen minimalist clue version instead.<br/>
<br/>
Jennifer and I had been lamenting our recent lack of box planting recently <br/>
(though we did restore four "heritage" boxes, so that should count for <br/>
something), but we have plans in place (and even some boxes ready to go <br/>
that I've been carrying around waiting for the right location to jump out <br/>
at us), so sometime after we get back from our trip to CT this weekend we <br/>
will start planting again. Or maybe we'll wait until it's too cold to <br/>
letterbox this winter. Or maybe I'll be better able to focus on new boxes <br/>
after I get to F500... Or maybe....<br/>

little harder to crack, longer to hike, trickier to find. I have a <br/>
PCLG mystery box on my kitchen counter to replace as soon as I get a <br/>
copy of the original stamp image. It hadn't been found in over two <br/>
years when I got it, but what a feeling of conquest to get that <br/>
thing!<br/>

&gt; Sounds like a good idea for a series. :) <br/>

There's the infamous/mysterious lemony snicket boxes (at least I <br/>
THINK they're boxes - in CA?) and now this popped up today:<br/>

But I think your idea of a SERIES would be an even better twist on <br/>
the phrase. What if everybody did a stamp on their most "unfortunate <br/>
incident" while letterboxing? Thinking back over people's posts - <br/>
there's a lot of funny stuff out there. <br/>

stamps, and there's at least one other that I remember seeing somewhere <br/>
else in the US.<br/>

But there's probably room for several Harry Potter series, so I wouldn't be <br/>
too discouraged.<br/>
