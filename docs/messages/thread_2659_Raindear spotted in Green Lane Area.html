Haven't been very active the last few years.<br/>
Trying to make a living (with marginal success).<br/>
Anyway, got around to some major maintenance work this weekend.<br/>
The following are back in action.<br/>
<br/>
All in Green Lane Park (somewhere)<br/>
Red Maple.<br/>
Caber Toss and Peaceable Kingdom (both part of Introduction to Boxing <br/>
Series).<br/>
Little Lady Bug<br/>
<br/>
I have most of my Perkiomen Trail set recarved (all six) and hope to <br/>
get them replaced this weekend too (or as soon as I can).<br/>
<br/>
I also have a set on a private camp grounds that I am planning to pull <br/>
and move to a public venue.  That would be another 6-7 boxes.<br/>
Watch the news.<br/>
Happy Trails.<br/>

<br/>
Glad to see you back in action.  I would love it if you could make it up <br/>
to Knoebels, but would understand if you did not being such short <br/>
notice.  I do hope to see you around soon.<br/>

Thanks for the "welcome back".<br/>
Not sure if I missed Knoebles already or not.<br/>
My kids love that place.<br/>
But every time I plant a box there, it loats away.<br/>
<br/>
I need to check the calendar for gathers, maybe I can make one this <br/>
fall.  <br/>
<br/>
Is this a Leap Year coming up again?<br/>
Guess so.  That last one I did was in 2004.(I still have the stamp-in <br/>
poster board)<br/>
I'd be up for it, (with some help) only Feb 29 falls on a Friday.<br/>
<br/>
I don't check this LBMA email every day, so if you really want to get <br/>
in touch, send one to my comcast address directly.<br/>
<br/>
Hope to see you on the trails!<br/>
