Eric is the real mystery box hound. Problem is . . . he keeps solving <br/>
ones that are too far away! I enjoy tinkering with the mysteries when <br/>
I know I've no hope of getting outside. I thought The Watcher was <br/>
really hard - many, many leaps of imagination to figure it out! Eric <br/>
tends to "think out of the box" - good for solving mysteries, not <br/>
good for basic road navigation! (Ouch, that will be a nice pinch when <br/>
he reads this!)</div>
