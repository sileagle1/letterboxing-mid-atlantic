but thought we'd extend the invite just the same :)<br/>
<br/>
Well, summer has unofficially made its grand exit, with the kids<br/>
here in ON and NY returning to school tomorrow.<br/>
<br/>
That also means that we're less than 4 weeks away from our Box ON!<br/>
gathering here in Belleville.<br/>
<br/>
I have had notes from a few boxers having to bow out of attending<br/>
for various reasons, so if possible, I'd like to get an update as to<br/>
whether you're planning on attending, or even thinking about it, so<br/>
I can better forecast attendance, food, etc.<br/>
<br/>
Regardless, this still promises to be a more intimate gathering than<br/>
most...perfect for first timers and more experienced boxers alike.<br/>
<br/>
So, please drop us a line, either here or privately, and for those<br/>
on AQ, please update your intent on the events calendar.<br/>
<br/>
See you soon, Jiggs</div>
