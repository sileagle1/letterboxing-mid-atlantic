I hit quite a few boxes in Ridley Creek SP this weekend.  Some of the <br/>
best stamps I'm seen to date, albeit in my short 3 year span boxing.  <br/>
I did however record my first on-trail exchange.  Couple of guys <br/>
(Party Pig and another who's name escapes me.  Had a bunch of #'s and <br/>
letters) all the way from Oneida, NY!!!  <br/>
<br/>
Mizscarlet &amp; Missmoon - I would direct this to you firstb/c I saw it <br/>
in your Casablanca, Frankly My Dear and Scarlet Pimpernel boxes . . . <br/>
what is the tool you use to carve out the straight lines that give <br/>
your stamps that great detail?  It seems to be some kind of double-<br/>
edged wedge toolthat you push along?<br/>
<br/>
If anyone else knows what I'm talking about, can you please tell me:<br/>
A) What is ti called?<br/>
B) Where can I get one?<br/>

the #5, all my carving is done with a #1 speedball carving tool. I still<br/>
use the one I got in my original carving tool kit I got when I first<br/>
started. They should be at any large art store or online. I think you get 5<br/>
or 6 tools, I forget. <br/>
<br/>
I know someone who has made her #1 even smaller by heating it with a flame<br/>
and gently bending it inward as it softened up. I tried doing it with a<br/>
pair of pliers and no heat but didn't like the result. It seemed to drag. I<br/>
haven't tried the heat method yet. <br/>
<br/>
I also do all my carving with a magnifying lamp. Can't do squat without it.<br/>
And yes, you do push it, not pull. You gouge the line out. Glad you liked<br/>
them!! <br/>

<div>To each his own about the speedball vs. the Staedler. If someone asks me about methods and tools, especially a newbie, I always tell them that they will hear all kinds of advice and methods from different people and just have to find the one that works best for them. Some people swear by Mastercarve. I hate the stuff. </div>
<div> </div>
<div>UHHHH...............and.......... ACK.......I didn't know it was a speciality exacto either. Now I have to get one. I always thought it was a regular one also. </div>
