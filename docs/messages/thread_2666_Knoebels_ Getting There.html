Knoebels, here are several ways you can do it.<br/>
<br/>
 From New York/ New England area<br/>
- Get yourself to I-89 west<br/>
- Take exit 241 for Rt 11 south<br/>
- Turn left onto Rt 487 South<br/>
- You follow Rt 487 to the park.  Watch for signs, as the road makes <br/>
several turns in Catawissa, including turning right at a Y after the <br/>
town that is easy to miss.  The campground is after you get to the park.<br/>
<br/>
 From the West<br/>
- Take I-80 East to exit 524 and take Rt 54 South<br/>
- Follow Rt 54 to Elysburg<br/>
- Turn left onto Rt 487 in Eylsburg<br/>
- This will take you right to the park.  The campground is before you <br/>
get to the park.<br/>
<br/>
 From The Harrisburg/Lancaster area<br/>
- Take I-81 North to exit 116<br/>
- Turn left onto Rt 901 North<br/>
- Turn left onto Rt 54 North (If you are going to dinner Friday night, <br/>
turn right here to go into Ashland)<br/>
- Turn Right onto Rt 487 North<br/>
- This will take you right to the park.  The campground is before you <br/>
get to the park.<br/>
<br/>
 From Baltimore Washington<br/>
- Take I-83 North to Harrisburg and follow the Harrisburg Directions above.<br/>
<br/>
 From Philadelphia<br/>
There are several different ways to take<br/>
Quick route<br/>
- Take the Northeast Extension to exit 95<br/>
- Go straight at the light and onto I-80 West<br/>
- Follow directions for New York/New England<br/>
<br/>
Scenic Route (Take if you are going to dinner Friday)<br/>
- Take Rt 422 West to Rt 222 North<br/>
- Exit for Rt 61 North<br/>
- Follow Rt 61 to Ashland (watch for several turns, they are well marked)<br/>
- Go through Ashland and stay straight onto Rt 54<br/>
- Follow directions for Harrisburg/Lancaster<br/>
<br/>
Going from the park to Devitto's<br/>
- From the park or campground, turn left onto Rt 487 South<br/>
- Turn left onto Rt 54 South<br/>
- This will take you into Ashland.  Devitto's is on the right just <br/>
before the end of town.<br/>
<br/>
I think that should cover it.  Email me if anymore directions are needed.<br/>

Thanks for the concise directions. Greatly appreciated! What, no GPS <br/>
co-ordinates? ;-)<br/>
<br/>
Can't wait to see you all. Leaving right after work on Friday and <br/>
hope to make it for dinner. Lancaster traffic is a bear though on <br/>
Fridays so don't wait for me! If I don't catch you there, will see <br/>
ya'll at the campground.<br/>

Just think of it as trying to follow one of Mizscarlet's clues ;-)<br/>

Also, for those that may be thinking about it, do not take I-78 from <br/>
Allentown to get to Rt 61 in Hamburg, it is construction nightmare.<br/>

anywhere near the Turnpike and the Harrisburg East exit.<br/>
