I don't consider you an outcast at all. 3 posts in 3 months is not a <br/>
lot. Not all posts here are responded to. Some are but are responded <br/>
to off list. <br/>
<br/>
I personally enjoy your humor, but as this summer job kicks my ass, I <br/>
find I don't have energy anymore to reply to each and every post and <br/>
each and every email that I'd like to. <br/>
<br/>
Don't take it personally..at least from my end. I was actually <br/>
wondering the other day where you've been hiding, because I do enjoy <br/>
your humor very much.<br/>

But seriously, I chuckle at your posts,  but then again I have a theatrical <br/>
background myself. You shouldn't let your obtuse -- er, I mean, offbeat &lt;g&gt; <br/>
-- sense of humor get in the way of participating.<br/>

Are you going to update your "Just Flying Through" clue to indicate that <br/>

<div>What the heck are you talking about???? You are NOT a pariah Oh Queen of the Dead Lemurs! I look forward to your posts as much as I do Poison Ivy's and Lady Prisspot. I love that you stir up the pot. Perhaps there's just not as much pot stirring to do here 'cause we pretty much get long with each other! But you are not a pariah and I know that you know not all posts get replied to. I posted the other day about my traveller in England, Hobo Phil. I was very excited and couldn't wait to share with my homies and no one responed. Oh well, it just didn't tickle anyone's typing bone. So maybe that's all it is. But you keep on posting but I wold stop the nose picking thing in public...might scare away any folks wanting to do an exchange...eeew!</div>
