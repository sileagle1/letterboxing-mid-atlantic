</span></blockquote>It was fantastic.  I hope to do a thorough follow up on my blog in the <br/>
next day or two, but I must say I am amazed. <br/>
<br/>
Thanks to everyone that came out.  There were an amazing amount of folks <br/>
for a gathering that has so few boxes. <br/>
<br/>
Thanks to JBZfarm for the wonderful boxes they planted.  The stamps are <br/>
spectacular.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks to everyone that camped.  We had a huge turnout for the camp, <br/>
which means one thing, I have to set it up better next year (and bring <br/>
more lights!)  If you have not camped at this or any of our gatherings, <br/>
you are really missing out.  It is one thing that I think really sets us <br/>
apart, our camp outs are a great time for everyone.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks to everyone that cleaned up afterwards, great job!<br/>
<br/>
I think you can expect more of the same next year, only a better <br/>
pavilion and some better site placement. <br/>
<br/>
So pencil in September 13th 2008 for the forth installment!<br/>

A big thank you to Nathan for setting up this fun event!  We were so<br/>
glad to re-connect with some dear friends and very happy to meet some<br/>
new ones. This is one event that is already on our calendar for next<br/>
year.  <br/>
<br/>
Thank you to everyone who found and replaced our boxes.  Rainbow Girl<br/>
survived!  That is quite a feat, knowing its placement and the<br/>
traffic.    While The Lighthouse was muggled, we were glad that 3 of<br/>
the 4 made it through the day.  We very much appreciate the care that<br/>
was taken by many of you in replacing these high trafficked boxes that<br/>
required such stealth.  We hope you enjoyed being sneaky.  For us it<br/>
was great fun as we knew where we could go in the park to find boxers.<br/>
 We peeked more than once to see who was stamping in.  It was a real<br/>
treat that is rarely experienced on the trail. <br/>
<br/>
Thanks for sharing in the fun.</div>
