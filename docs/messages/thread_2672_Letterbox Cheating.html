13,000 or whatever she's at now. <br/>

&gt; Perhaps a sentence at the beginning of the listing saying something <br/>
&gt; like "this was previously listed elsewhere" might make those people <br/>
&gt; feel better and leave you alone.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I do keep track of my finds on AQ, but you know, that's just for me.  <br/>

the ribbon only counts boxes you find out in the wild, not event boxes or 
hitchhikers.

I don't remember; I read it a long time ago.

I think that's right, though, because I keep an Excel spreadsheet of what 
I've found (yeah, I'm a NERD) and I don't count anything but boxes I find out in 
the wild, not hitchhikers, travelers, etc, and it's pretty close to my AQ 
count.  My AQ count is actually lower, because I'm sure I missed inputting a box 
or two here or there.

I don't really care if people inflate their F counts.  I mean, what does that 
get you?  I feel kind of bad for the people who feel the need to do that, 
actually.  I know what my count is, approximately.  I don't really pay attention 
to anyone else's, because I'm only competing with myself.

Which brings to mind, I know someone in another part of the country who<br/>

they are just garbage, no thought given to the box, stamp or location. It's<br/>

&gt; &gt; &gt; Subject: [lbma] Letterbox Cheating<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; I recently posted to LBNA some of the boxes I have mentioned <br/>
&gt; here, where<br/>
&gt; &gt; the clues <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; themselves are hidden.  I have gotten two responses from those <br/>
&gt; postings<br/>
&gt; &gt; suggesting that I <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; was listing boxes with plant dates going back to 2005 so that <br/>
&gt; people<br/>
&gt; &gt; could pump up their F <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; count.<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; I'm curious.  I don't keep track of my PFX etc. count.  Is there <br/>
&gt; much of<br/>
&gt; &gt; that kind of cheating <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; going on?  Fake F's?  Bogus P's?    And if so,  why would you <br/>
&gt; cheat in a<br/>
&gt; &gt; game where nobody <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; keeps score - except yourself?<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; If you have some insight, pray share it with me, please.<br/>

<div><br/></div><font size="2"><pre><font face="arial,helvetica">I think that if you read the FAQ on Atlas Quest, it says that the F-count on 
the ribbon only counts boxes you find out in the wild, not event boxes or 
hitchhikers.

I don't remember; I read it a long time ago.

I think that's right, though, because I keep an Excel spreadsheet of what 
I've found (yeah, I'm a NERD) and I don't count anything but boxes I find out in 
the wild, not hitchhikers, travelers, etc, and it's pretty close to my AQ 
count.  My AQ count is actually lower, because I'm sure I missed inputting a box 
or two here or there.

I don't really care if people inflate their F counts.  I mean, what does that 
get you?  I feel kind of bad for the people who feel the need to do that, 
actually.  I know what my count is, approximately.  I don't really pay attention 
to anyone else's, because I'm only competing with myself.

Anyone who bosts about their F count like that...

To me, it's kind of like the guy on the highway that feels the need to drive 
the biggest car and bully everyone else on the road... the guy who has to have 
a HUGE dog and a REALLY big remote control.

Compensating for another insecurity.

<p>Actually there is a certain amount of cheating going on. Event boxes 
  are<br/>listed on AQ as regular boxes , as one example. People count postals 
  and<br/>personal travelers, HHs on tables at events as finds in their own 
  logbooks<br/>even if AQ doesn't. I recently removed quite a number of "finds" 
  from AQ<br/>of event boxes, after checking with my conscious. But all those 
  other<br/>people who stamped into those same boxes and listed them as finds 
  didn't<br/>have that problem. And I don't even know why it's become this big 
  thing to<br/>keep count on AQ, but I do it. I get a kick out of seeing them all 
  listed,<br/>such as they are. What can I say? <br/><br/>As for the complainers, 
  they fall into the catagory of get a life in my<br/>opinion, and if that gets 
  back to anyone who did the complaining and you<br/>have a problem with it, feel 
  free to e-mail me at any time. But be<br/>advised, anyone who comes into my 
  mailbox uninvited and gives me a hard<br/>time is not received well, if you get 
  my drift. Don't sweat it. Any large<br/>group contains a certain amount of 
  jerks and we have certainly have our<br/>share. Just the fact that it bothers 
  them pretty much says it all about how<br/>they look at the hobby, and what do 
  you care what they think? <br/><br/>MissMoon<br/><br/>&gt; [Original
