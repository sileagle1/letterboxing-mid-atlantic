battery-powered magnetic LED light signs promoting one of their shows that shut down big <br/>
parts of Boston for most of the day - I got calls from 2 non-letterboxing friends who know I <br/>
have this weird hobby where I hide things in cities.  They wanted to know if the strange <br/>
boxes the Boston police found might be mine.<br/>
<br/>
I of course replied, "I dunno.  Could be."  One of those friends works in TV  and passed the <br/>
info to a news producer who called and wanted to interview me about letterboxing.</div>
