Thanks for the info, Leabhar. We might have been the ones to discover
this - we intended to hit NN Park earlier this summer, but ended up
getting distracted by VB and BullDawg's gather there. Glad to hear
you'll be rehabbing the boxes. I wish we had images to offer, but you
could check with QOCMike who's been boxing in the area for a number of
years and so might have these images.<br/>
