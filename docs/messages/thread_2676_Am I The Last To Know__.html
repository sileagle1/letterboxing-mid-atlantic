 For some reason this discussion of quality and cheating brings this to mind.............someone just told me about the theft of a very large number of boxes, mostly in Connecticut. I forget when it happened. Am I the last one to hear about this? Is it old news? That's a damn shame. <br/><br/>MissMoon<br/><br/><br/></html></div>

many boxes that is little comfort to those whose boxes were taken. <br/>
There was a lot of discussion about it on other boards, many other <br/>
boxes and clues were pulled to protect them, and some offers to <br/>
recarve and rehide boxes. It was good to see the community circle <br/>
the wagons and support each other. <br/>
<br/>
In the end someone said our mantra should be "Replant!" They can't <br/>
keep us down. And most agreed. Many have been replanted and/or <br/>
reposted.<br/>
