                    <div id="ygrps-yiv-188982675">Otis is dead on correct.  Another thing is to ponder the clue concept <br/>
or structure first, then create the stamp to match that.  Some ideas <br/>
just pop into your head when cutting the lawn or some such.  The box <br/>
location becomes secondary as far as that is concerned, just that it <br/>
be appropriate for hiding a mystery box due to the theme of the clue <br/>
or in a spot that is unusual or scenic for whatever reason.<br/>
<br/>
In the end, there are many ways to make things mysterious.  From <br/>
simple substitution ciphers to the field of semiotics (look it up on <br/>
Wikipedia), something that good old mapsurfer employs in most of his <br/>
great eevil works.<br/>

<br/>
To add a bit, I think that the answer to this question is really to <br/>
listen to yourself - what interests you? - and then to tune into <br/>
those ideas or activities or places or whatever.  We've based boxes <br/>
on a cool local ghost story, a former WWII army base, a park in my <br/>
hometown, some beers that we like, etc.  Sometimes the inspiration is <br/>
what annoys you - whatever stirs a reaction can be the basis for a <br/>
box, and in that is the some of the artistry in letterboxing.<br/>
<br/>
I think that the box and clues and location should share a context.  <br/>
If you want me to walk a few miles for your box, that's cool - but <br/>
don't have me take 5 laps around a borough park - instead, put the <br/>
box in large park and give me a tour.  Better yet, take me to your <br/>
favorite part of the park and plant a stamp that represents it.<br/>
<br/>
That's the inspirational part but, being said, be silly if you want <br/>
to be silly.  <br/>

focused on location and creative stamps, but our mystery clues aren't<br/>
too tough. One of my favorites is "Lost Lobster" sung to the tune of<br/>
"Rock Lobster" for you 80s fans. We've found some too, of course, but<br/>
I wanted to come up with something different/new and you've all given<br/>
me some inspiration on what I need to look for and do.  Thanks so much!<br/>

I doubt I will ever solve those math ones LB.  I'll have to employ PA<br/>

<p>On occasion I've had a box theme and a park in mind that I've never<br/>been 
  to. Gotten trail map(s) online and researched area history or<br/>points of 
  note. Actually written the clue before I've even left the<br/>house up to the 
  point of actually placement. Get to park, follow my<br/>'clue', then add the 
  final degrees, sling-shot tree, SPOR or SPOS.<br/><br/>Those are probably the 
  only ones that make it to LB.org because I<br/>haven't lost my notes after 
  unpacking suitcase.<br/><br/>sewsowbizzy<br/><br/>--- In <a href="mailto:lbma%40yahoogroups.com" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">lbma@yahoogroups. com</a>, "jbzfarm"

somebody a nice hike?  Doesn't matter what your box, stamp or clue is.  They will enjoy <br/>
the hike.  I have series that I have designed based on location.  I have boxes that I have <br/>
designed based on clues and puzzles.  Mostly, my work takes me to interesting places all <br/>
over the country.  I like to leave boxes behind.  So I find a place to hide and try to work up <br/>
an interesting clue later.<br/>
Sometimes, I prefer the creativity forced on me by happenstance than days of elaborate <br/>
planning.<br/>

PS:  Mostly I like messing with Cyclonic, though.<br/>

&gt; One method:  Think of a stamp you're interested in, then think of a logical place where <br/>
that person/place/thing "belongs."  (Or, think of a great place to put a box and carve a <br/>
stamp that has something to do with the history or geography of that place.)  Then think <br/>
up a story about your stamp.  As you picture the story in your mind, match plot points up <br/>
to landmarks along the way to the stamp.<br/>
&gt;    <br/>
&gt;   That Games magazine may also help.  Even if you don't use the same puzzles, it helps <br/>
to start thinking about other ways to create puzzles.<br/>
&gt;    <br/>
&gt;   If there's another hobby you're involved in, think about whether it has recognized <br/>
conventions that might be useful for building a clue - something that isn't readily obvious <br/>
to everyone, but that becomes clear once you realize what the clue is all about.<br/>
&gt;    <br/>
&gt;   The most important thing to do is to trust your instincts.  If it seems to you like <br/>
something that works, it does.  <br/>
&gt;    <br/>
&gt;   If you hit a wall, take a break.  Don't surround yourself with yourself.  Move on back <br/>
two squares.<br/>
