	Just up the street from Ben Franklin you will find a building that houses an institution he <br/>
founded which spread to every city and town in the country.  This stamp represents <br/>
something Franklin invented to give the people in that building less to do.<br/>
<br/>
	One block away is a box placed by the people of another institution founded by Dr. <br/>
Franklin which also spread to every city and town.  You, of all people, should know  where to <br/>
look.</div>

Do not retrieve or replace unless you can do so stealthily.<br/>
Have an excuse.<br/>
Drop your keys.<br/>
Tie your shoes.<br/>
You do not need to go on private/controlled property to get this box.<br/>
If you need a place to stamp in, there's always the Starbucks.</div>
