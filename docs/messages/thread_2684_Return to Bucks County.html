Plan on planting one box and finding at least one. Plan on doing the <br/>
newest one in Peace Valley Park and hopefuly some in Tyler Park that <br/>
are new since we left. Today Teapot found box # 500 and Eagle got his <br/>
on 8/19/07. CT has boxes just about everywhere you look. We just have <br/>
not been as active since moving. Time to turn things around and get out <br/>
more often. We have been able to continue with at least one box a <br/>
month. <br/>
