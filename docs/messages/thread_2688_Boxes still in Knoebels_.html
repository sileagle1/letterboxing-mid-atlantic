We might be camping this weekend near Knoebels, and I was looking into <br/>
the boxes there. Are there any leftover from the gathering? I've found <br/>
about 5 posted on LBNA/AQ. Just wondering :)<br/>

Thanks,<br/>

</span></blockquote>Last I knew the Lighthouse box is gone, and possibly the Phoenix, but <br/>
the others are in place, as far as I know.  Knoebels Grove is under a <br/>
pile of gravel.  It may still be there, but bring a shovel to get it out.<br/>
<br/>
As far as area boxes, both your Ashland boxes are in decent shape.  <br/>
Mother could use a new box, the old one is cracked.  But it was dry.  <br/>
Piece-a Pizza has a new box and log and looks great, so stop in and say <br/>
hi to Tom and his wife.<br/>
<br/>
We did not check on the box in Centralia.<br/>
<br/>
Waiting is in fine shape in Danville<br/>
<br/>
Pineknotter Nuptials looked good in Sunbury, and be sure to get up and g <br/>
et Hey Mose as well, neat clues, but not as neat as the clues for the <br/>
mystery box in the same park.  Those boxes looked good as well.<br/>
<br/>
Hope that helps, and have fun.  Hope you don't get the ride nazi on the <br/>
Flyers and can get some good snapping in :-)<br/>
