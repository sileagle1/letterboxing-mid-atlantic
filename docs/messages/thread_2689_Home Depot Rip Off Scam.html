<br/>
Over the last month I became a victim of a clever scam while shopping <br/>
at Home Depot in Smoketown Plaza.  Simply going out to get supplies <br/>
has turned out to be quite traumatic.  Don't be naive enough to think <br/>
it couldn't happen to you or your friends.<br/>
<br/>
Here's how the scam works:  Two seriously good-looking 20-21 year-old <br/>
girls come over to your car as you are packing your purchases into <br/>
the trunk.  They both start wiping your windshield with a rag and <br/>
Windex, with their breasts almost falling out of their skimpy shirts. <br/>
It is impossible not to look.<br/>
<br/>
When you thank them and offer them a tip, they say "no" and instead <br/>
ask you for a ride to another Home Depot or Lowe's.  You agree and <br/>
they get in the back seat.<br/>
<br/>
On the way, they start undressing.  Then one of them climbs over into <br/>
the front seat and starts crawling all over you, while the other one <br/>
steals your wallet.  <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I had my wallet stolen August 4th, 9th, 10th, twice on the 15th, <br/>
17th, 20th, &amp; 24th.  Also September 1st, 3rd, 16th and am going after <br/>
work today.<br/>
<br/>
Please be careful.</div>
