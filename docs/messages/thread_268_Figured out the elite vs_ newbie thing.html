1998-oh,2000ish - promotion by EMS &amp; other outdoorsy-type places and <br/>
publications. Hikers and other outdoorsy-types go back out to the <br/>
woods with rubber stamps added to their compasses.<br/>
2000ish-2004 - various articles appear in the Family outing/things <br/>

the woods in said regions, compasses in hands.<br/>
2004 - article appears in Time magazine<br/>
<br/>
The demographics keep expanding.<br/>
Not seeking flames; I just had an "Ah-Hah!" moment last night <br/>
talking about LB with a neighbor when I found myself mentioning the <br/>
two very different magazines in rapid succession. It ties into Wanda <br/>
telling me at a gathering last summer that when she started it was <br/>
much more a "Mensa-like" thing to crack clues.<br/>
<br/>
So, newbies - get out there and read Smithsonian.<br/>
(kidding kidding kidding.... I love newbies - they give me more <br/>
boxes to find....)<br/>

doubt we'll see many flames.<br/>
<br/>
That kind of reminds me of a saying we used to say back in college...<br/>
<br/>
"No matter how good you think you are at something, there is always<br/>
somebody better at it!"<br/>
<br/>
So, US elitists have something to chew on when they consider the UK<br/>
scene.<br/>
<br/>
So, any guesses who the Ã¼ber boxer of all is. It certainly aint me<br/>
and that person probably resides across the pond!<br/>
