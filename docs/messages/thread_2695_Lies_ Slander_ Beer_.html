                <div class="message-content">
                    <div id="ygrps-yiv-1701478188"><div>Okay, I see know what they say about an idle mind being the devils toolbox, or is it idle hands, or the devil is idle because he can't find his tools....</div> <div> </div> <div>Whatever, anyway I did NOT set England on fire because it's too wet and wouldn't catch! There were a couple of small fires on the moor while I was there but I had absolutely nothing to do with them and I have several pubs full of my new friends who will swear to it!</div> <div> </div> <div>I refuse to be held responsible for the piece of bridge that fell on Andys car. If his people weren't so tiny they would have a better sense of scale and would know how to build bridges that trucks, sorry Lorries, can actually fit under!</div> <div> </div> <div>And I do believe there were a few pints of Dartmoor Jail Ale left at the Plume of Feathers when I left, but I did drink one of the bottles I bought as a souvenir for my son (shhh...he'll never know)</div> <div> </div>
<div>All dogs in Devon and Cornwall got a nice friendly hello from me and no, I do NOT speak with a redneck accent. It's just that's the only accent Andy knows how to do. Much like my spot-on English accent that I learned from Dick Van Dyke in Mary Poppins. But according to Andy no one talks like that, nor uses the word "Guvna" and England is not a nation of happy-go-lucky chimney sweeps. Who knew? I was also stunned to learn that there is no such thing as a Ministry of Silly Walks. I feel that Disney and Monty Python have mis-lead me.</div> <div> </div> <div>SO no fires, left a few drops of beer. I did manage to write a new song while I was there and Clueless (Jennifer) worked up the choreography for me. It's an autobiographical little ditty that I wrote after my first day on the Moor:</div> <div> </div> <div>Well I tore my pants and my ass is hanging out, </div> <div>My ass is hanging out, my ass is hanging out.</div> <div>Oh I tore my pants and my ass is
 hanging out so I look mighty "cheeky" today!</div> <div> </div> <div>As you can imagine, it's a quite a hit all over southwestern England. But after a little duct tape I was still able to go to the pub and play trivia with my crew. We tied for second place! We would have won first but were distracted when Sherlock Holmes walked by our table. I kid you not.</div> <div> </div> <div>Judy and I also managed to land temp jobs as receptionists in a tattoo shop and so now I have gainful employment waiting for me when Dude and I emigrate!</div> <div> </div> <div>Andy is now an official Red Hat Boy Toy and I realized on our way home from New Hampshire that both of our Boy Toys live in Bristol! Nathan in Bristol, PA USA and Andy in Bristol, England. It was meant to be. Andy, Nathan knows your pain as he gets to have us around all of the time!</div> <div> </div> <div>As soon as I figure out how I will post some pictures in the photos file.</div>
<div> </div> <div>I am happy to be home with Dude, he missed me so much he stopped eating. But I sure do wish I was still in England. I feel like I left a part of me there and can't wait to go back.</div> <div> </div> <div>H&amp;H</div><p>
