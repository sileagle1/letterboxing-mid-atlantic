 not exactly sure of where to look.<br/>Mony Loop - State #2 - didn't even try for this one, after 3 hours roaming around, my back wouldn't let me go any further..<br/><br/><b><i>sewsowbizzy &lt;sowbiz@...&gt;</i></b> wrote:<blockquote><span title="qreply"> <blockquote class="ygrps-yiv-500761522replbq" style="border-left:2px solid rgb(16, 16, 255);margin-left:5px;padding-left:5px;"> <div id="ygrps-yiv-500761522ygrp-text"> <div>Boxes were not pulled by me (ssb) - and hopefully their park rangers<br/> have better things to do than gather them up just because the<br/> applications are expiring.<br/> <br/> Had to head home early because I left my PZ Cut supply in NH and I<br/> have stamps to be carved!!<br/> <br/> I'll post again when I make plans to pull them -- with a few days notice.<br/> Judy<br/>

 on this one.  Plus I had no idea what Kruger's knuckles looked like.  Had to ask my daughter when I got home.  Pretty sure was at the right place, but not exactly sure of where to look.<br/>Mony Loop - State #2 - didn't even try for this one, after 3 hours roaming around, my back wouldn't let me go any further..<br/></div></div> <div style="CLEAR:both;FONT-SIZE:1px;COLOR:#fff;">.</div><img height="1" src="http://geo.yahoo.com/serv?s=97359714/grpId=12213842/grpspId=1705065786/msgId=14967/stime=1191430948/nc1=4767086/nc2=4507179/nc3=4699083" width="1"/> <br/><span style="
