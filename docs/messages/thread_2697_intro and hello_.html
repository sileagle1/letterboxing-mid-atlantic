                    <div id="ygrps-yiv-370014622">Hi! My name is Victor, and my gf &amp; I are new letterboxers. My trail <br/>
name is Ratinabox and hers is Abita. We live in Montgomery County, <br/>
MD, bordering Washington DC. We started letterboxing about a month <br/>
ago (intersting story behind that, but I'll save it for another <br/>
post); we've already found six boxes on five sets of clues (one was <br/>
a two-box clue), and just last Saturday we found our first <br/>
hitchhiker.<br/>
<br/>
(To say we were excited was putting it mildly. If I could do <br/>
backflips, I probably wouldn't have. Ground wasn't really <br/>
level 'round there.)<br/>
<br/>
She's eager to plant our first box; we've already scouted out some <br/>
locations and are looking for two more places to plant them, since <br/>
she's decided on a three-box clue. It's a clever theme so I don't <br/>
blame her, but the place we want to hide them is around a community <br/>
lake, and I fear the chance of vandalism is rather high.<br/>
<br/>
I hope I can learn a lot from the more experienced 'boxers on this <br/>
list...and that I hope you don't mind hearing from a new letterboxer <br/>
every now and then.<br/>
