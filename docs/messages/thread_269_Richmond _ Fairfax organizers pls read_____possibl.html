<br/>
I am in the process of trying to find a date for our 2nd annual <br/>
letterbox gathering in southern NJ.  <br/>
<br/>
Last year it was on October 26, this year I was hoping for October <br/>
23rd but now I see that date is taken for the Richmond gathering.  <br/>
Could someone please tell me when you plan on holding the Fairfax <br/>
gathering?  I would hate to coincide with either city.  Maybe I will <br/>
try for the end of September instead of late October (as many people <br/>
were busy preparing for the upcoming holiday events).<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
For any one who attended last years "Jersey Devil" gathering last <br/>
October, do you have a preference as to where you would like to have <br/>
this one.  Did you all mind travelling "that" far for it?  Would you <br/>
like to see something a little closer to civilization?  Just putting <br/>
this question out there, I really enjoyed the location last year and <br/>
thought it was fitting for the theme of the gathering.  <br/>
<br/>
Since they do have camping facilities at the site of last years <br/>
gathering: tent sites, group tent sites, rv sites, and cabins (but I <br/>
think those are already booked) maybe we could have a camping weekend <br/>
just like they did in PA in July.  Just putting the feelers out on <br/>
this one.  I've created a poll for this so please vote.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Thanks  <br/>
<br/>

steer clear of that weekend.<br/>
<br/>
Oh, and 9/18 and 10/17 and the weekends of 9/25-26 and 10/23-24 won't work <br/>
for us....<br/>

Don't forget about Daylight Savings Time ending. Last year we met on <br/>
the first weekend of "shorter" days, and I felt like we'd lost a <br/>
whole hour of hunting time. (Of course if we'd stopped talking and <br/>
left the gazebo sooner, it would have helped, too!)<br/>

folks to vote on their available weekends, rather than posting such <br/>

you set it up that way.  Then pick the weekend with the most hits.  <br/>
Post the opening of the poll and how long it will be open (give it at <br/>
least 3 wks - vacations etc) and post reminders each week.<br/>
<br/>
When you do decide on the dates block them out on the CALENDAR and <br/>
include the Post No or other location for getting all the pertinent <br/>
info.  <br/>

Am I getting too organized for this group?<br/>

quickly!<br/>
