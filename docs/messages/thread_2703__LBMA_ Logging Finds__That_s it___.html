<div>I've been in that position before. I was geocaching and hit two caches on 
one side of the White Clay Creek. The third was on the other side. Why not? The 
creek isn't very deep or wide. So I crossed, it was deeper than I expected. My 
cotton khakis were soaked, no big deal. As I raised my foot to the root of the 
tree, bank was high, I heard the rip. I walked the path back thankful that I was 
on the less used side of the creek. Went back another day for the cache. 
Interesting though, by the time I got back to my car, about a mile hike. I was 
in a pretty good mood. Guess it was the deer, rabbits and beaver that did it. 
It's for adventures like this that I go out letterboxing and geocaching. </div>

<div>I've been in that position before. I was geocaching and hit two caches on one side of the White Clay Creek. The third was on the other side. Why not? The creek isn't very deep or wide. So I crossed, it was deeper than I expected. My cotton khakis were soaked, no big deal. As I raised my foot to the root of the tree, bank was high, I heard the rip. I walked the path back thankful that I was on the less used side of the creek. Went back another day for the cache. Interesting though, by the time I got back to my car, about a mile hike. I was in a pretty good mood. Guess it was the deer, rabbits and beaver that did it. It's for adventures like this that I go out letterboxing and geocaching. </div>
