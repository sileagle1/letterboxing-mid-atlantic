available online LB.org or AQ) -- and I must say walking a few streets<br/>
around the Pavilion (9201 Center Street)is very quaint.  GR has picked<br/>
a great location for a crawl.<br/>
<br/>
Glad to see the GREEN will be attending!!<br/>

                    <div id="ygrps-yiv-2043664129">thanks to my bud, Gallant Rogue.  I expected a real laid back event <br/>
with not much work to do on our part to solve clues etc, but this <br/>
laid back event was nothing of the sort.  There were some great <br/>
stamps, great clues, and great newbies to meet.<br/>
<br/>
not sure how he had the time to make this happen in the short <br/>
timespan, but kudos to him and all the carvers that helped make this <br/>
civil war theme event work.<br/>
<br/>
I must also thank my team, of me and my wife, and newbie WinPax.  SHe <br/>
is a great person, that we all welcome to this great hobby.  Thanks <br/>
for the talk, the friendship, the medicine, and just for being you.  <br/>
In addition, I must thank my greatest of friend Brian and Lori of <br/>
TGD.  I truely love them, and this event woulkd have lacked without <br/>
them.  Greta to see you guys, and continue our great, growing bond. <br/>
Go Rebel Raiders.<br/>
<br/>
I met some GREAT newbies, and the highlight of that was a group of 3 <br/>
little gal, names the "3 Detectives"..they were too cute.<br/>
<br/>
Also wanna thanks the locals that I have grown to know over the <br/>
years, for making this area a great, tight area of boxers, that i <br/>
truely appreciate...and call my friends.  I a lucky to be in an area <br/>
with such a core group.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks again to GR....<br/>
<br/>
love ya bro</div>

<br/>
GR wrote some challenging clues and the distance/routing really kept<br/>
the teams apart so we weren't on top of each other.  Great Logistics.<br/>
<br/>
I echo KoC's question -- please post the box names and carvers.<br/>
<br/>
It was a pleasure meeting new team member DragonLady (who was the only<br/>
one to guess my new PT -- albeit I did give her more than 3 guesses)-<br/>
and the Castle Keepers are great fun team members to have.<br/>

time. I felt very welcomed by this group of friendly people and I will <br/>
definitely be back for another event. I was so charged that I went out <br/>
to Riverbend Park on Sunday for six more boxes! Thanks to Gallant <br/>
Rogue for setting up such a fun event and to the Artillery Company for <br/>
being awesome teammates. I shall have to get a new logbook now, all <br/>
these new stamps have filled it up.<br/>
