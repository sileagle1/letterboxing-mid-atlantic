<br/>
I am in the process of trying to find a date for our 2nd annual <br/>
letterbox gathering in southern NJ.  <br/>
<br/>
Last year it was on October 26, this year I was hoping for October <br/>
23rd but now I see that date is taken for the Richmond gathering.  <br/>
Could someone please tell me when you plan on holding the Fairfax <br/>
gathering?  I would hate to coincide with either city.  Maybe I will <br/>
try for the end of September instead of late October (as many people <br/>
were busy preparing for the upcoming holiday events).<br/>

<br/>
For any one who attended last years "Jersey Devil" gathering last <br/>
October, do you have a preference as to where you would like to have <br/>
this one.  Did you all mind travelling "that" far for it?  Would you <br/>
like to see something a little closer to civilization?  Just putting <br/>
this question out there, I really enjoyed the location last year and <br/>
thought it was fitting for the theme of the gathering.  <br/>
<br/>
Since they do have camping facilities at the site of last years <br/>
gathering: tent sites, group tent sites, rv sites, and cabins (but I <br/>
think those are already booked) maybe we could have a camping weekend <br/>
just like they did in PA in July.  Just putting the feelers out on <br/>
this one.  I've created a poll for this so please vote.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Thanks  <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Bzzzz,<br/>
