Valley where there are MILES of trails, overlooks, and scenery.  I have <br/>
been looking into this for some time, and am posting to look for <br/>
inerest and dates.<br/>
<br/>
I would like to get 1-2 cabins.  One cabin is in the $550 range for the <br/>
weekend and has 3 bedroms, game room, family room firepit and kitchen, <br/>
etc.  Along with this we can set up campsites and tents.<br/>
<br/>
I was thinking early spring to avoid the extreme heat.<br/>
<br/>
If interest is here, i will post a poll with dates etc.  <br/>
<br/>
and yes, I will have surprises....dont i always?</div>
