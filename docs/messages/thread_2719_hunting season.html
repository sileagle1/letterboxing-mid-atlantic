<div><font face="Arial" size="2">Deer and dove season started September 1 in 
Delaware.  We went out to the canal a few weeks ago and were startled by a 
guy in camo with a cross-bow, in the only bush in the middle of a barren, 
200-yard wide sand pit.  I think he only made his presence known because we 
were making a ton of noise and scaring away his quarry.  He warned us that 
we should think about going away because it might be easy for us to get shot by 
a stray bit of ammo, but somehow I think that as we were out in the open, loud 
and obvious and he was so well hidden that we didn't see him until he said 
something right next to us, that it was not our safety he was concerned 
about.</font></div>

                    <div id="ygrps-yiv-21523403">Speaking of hunting season here's a morbid little tale that vaugely relates. About 2 years ago <br/>
a dear friend's father who had Alzhiemer's disease wandered away from home. He was in bed <br/>
next to his wife and when she woke up he was gone. They seached the area for days then <br/>
expanded the seach to cover Philly to Baltimore. Police were called in missing person papers <br/>
were filed ect. ect. , he was not to found. That is until yesterday when a hunter found some <br/>
remains about a mile from his house.<br/>
I often wondered about comming upon somthing like this while searching a bit off trail. <br/>
Hiking with the some of the RHLB's we came upon a women's blouse just off trail. It wasn't <br/>
something one would wear hiking and it kinda made the hair on the back of my neck rise a <br/>
bit.</div>

are not as isolated, the population density makes anything possible right be hind the next <br/>
tree.  I remember going after a box in downtown Atlanta.  The variety and type of filth in <br/>
conjunction with other cast off items such as children's clothing make you shudder.</div>

&gt; &gt; Also to chime in about hunters, IV and I ran into<br/>
&gt; &gt; some hunters <br/>
&gt; &gt; recently in a PA SGL.  He was was going to try out<br/>
&gt; &gt; his new gun on a <br/>
&gt; &gt; nearby SGL rifle range, so I asked him if anything<br/>
&gt; &gt; was in season.  <br/>
&gt; &gt; His response was "Only crows, but nobody want to eat<br/>
&gt; &gt; them anyway!"  <br/>
&gt; &gt; Our hunter was a lot more polite than yours.  <br/>

&gt; &gt; &gt; Okay, I'm a little late (but Sept was too hot<br/>
&gt; &gt; anyway).  Rozebud and <br/>
&gt; &gt; I <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; ran into 2 hunters in STL, one w/ a bow the other<br/>
&gt; &gt; w/ a gun.  <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; The hunter kinda has a point.  Shot has to go<br/>
&gt; &gt; somewhere and it <br/>
&gt; &gt; doesn't <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; all hit the quarry.  I'm sure you were fine in the<br/>
&gt; &gt; field but I'd be <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; more concerned in the woods.  <br/>

&gt; &gt; &gt; He warned us that we should think about going away<br/>
&gt; &gt; because it might <br/>
&gt; &gt; be <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; easy for us to get shot by a stray bit of ammo,<br/>
&gt; &gt; but somehow I think <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; that as we were out in the open, loud and obvious<br/>
&gt; &gt; and he was so <br/>
&gt; &gt; well <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; hidden that we didn't see him until he said<br/>
&gt; &gt; something right next to <br/>
&gt; &gt; us, <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; that it was not our safety he was concerned about.<br/>
