                    <div id="ygrps-yiv-898875750">I agree with MizS - MasterCarve is crummy and toooo thick - takes up<br/>
valuable log book space.  <br/>
I have found at my local ACMoore they have some 4x6 pink stuff on the<br/>
shelf and I run in every week with my 40% coupon and scoop up a piece<br/>
at $5.49-40%.  And oh how nice it was for carving again.  Albeit white<br/>
PZ is only 1% less enjoyable<br/>
<br/>
If you are using a laser printer (toner not ink) then try transferring<br/>
with Acetone (I use a can from HomeDepot not nail polish remover that<br/>
has other oily ingredients).  Print, lay rightside down, lightly rub<br/>
with tissue wetted with Acetone.  Too much may smear image - but then<br/>
just wipe rubber clean and try again with new printed page/image.<br/>
<br/>
Absent the Acetone -- like when flying - I use the No.2 soft pencil<br/>
method but I just print on bond, run the pencil around the lines, flip<br/>
and rub.<br/>
<br/>
Both of these methods have the printed image flipped right side down<br/>
on the material so Instant Reversal of text -- no backwards letters --<br/>
now if I could only learn to speal.<br/>

order and no plans to order Douggerware in the immediate future.<br/>
<br/>
I had contacted  the company that makes the Douggerware - and the even rarer Douggerware <br/>
Jr. in the 3 and 2 cup size - about buying a case lot.  I never followed up since I bought <br/>
decon containers.  If there is an interest out there, my company could order a case lot to split <br/>
up.<br/>

Any takers?</div>

work, for a fundraising event involving alcohol - if you were old <br/>
enough and paid admission, we stamped our logo on the back of your <br/>
hand.  PR person wanted to send out for the stamp, and I was <br/>
like "No!  Let me carve it!"  I brought my little craft iron to work, <br/>
laser-printed the logo, hit it with the iron and got...a mess.<br/>
<br/>
Fortunately, the mess is only stuck to the paper, so I flipped the <br/>
rubber over and did it again, the old-fashioned way.<br/>
<br/>
Perhaps MasterCarve would be ok with a lower-temp setting on the <br/>
iron, but the craft iron has no temperature settings, just on/off.<br/>
