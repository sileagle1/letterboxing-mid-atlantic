points to whom remembers what it says)?<br/>
<br/>
Does it serve purpose, but to shield the balding pate from summer's <br/>
rays or protect it from winters cold breezes?<br/>
<br/>
Well, yesterday it did.  Twas walking back from a short saunter at <br/>
Green Lane Park in Raindear Country, when some breeze caught an Oak <br/>
Tree during what must be a mast year (lotsa fruit compared to other <br/>
years).  As the acorns came running down I thought "I wonder how <br/>
much protection this slimy old hat provide if I would get hit on the <br/>
bean?"<br/>
<br/>
Well, my question was soon answered.  Thwock!  An acorn of unknown <br/>
size and origin hit me on the left side of my hat covered head.  <br/>
While it smarted a little, I think the old slimy did add another <br/>
layer of protection to the old noggin!  So, you can add <br/>
acorn/hickory nut protector to sunblock and windscreen to the <br/>
purposes of the slimy old hat.  Although, I think the ubiquitous and <br/>
much more massive black walnut may be a bit much for its defenses.  <br/>
Not as prim as Cyclonic's fine fedora, yet also not a hat of red, <br/>
but a slimy hat worn with pride.<br/>
<br/>
No clue was written into this silly post and Jenny's area code is <br/>
610, natch.<br/>

Leafcutters and I were hiking in an area prone to Black Walnut <br/>
trees.  While we were reading the kiosk map, a huge Walnut smashed to <br/>
the ground not 4 inches from my head- scared the living crap out of <br/>
me!  Thinking about hiking with a construction hat :) Lotus<br/>
