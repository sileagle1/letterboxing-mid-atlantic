from Western NY), I thought I'd let you know about our Hallowed<br/>
Grounds Tour on the 20th of October. We're doing a driving tour of the<br/>
some of the famous and not so famous cemeteries in Orleans County, NY<br/>
that'll end on our (The Sprite &amp; the Highlander's) doorstep. The clues<br/>
are finally done and are posted on our website. Either click on the<br/>
website at the event page here:<br/>
<a href="http://www.atlasquest.com/events/event.html?gEventId=453" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.atlasquest.com/events/event.html?gEventId=453</a><br/>
<br/>
or go to the AQ page for the boxes and the clue link will take you<br/>
right to it:<br/>

<br/>
Again, if you can make it out our way, it promises to be a fruitful<br/>
venture. There's 31 stamps in the series, plus several on the wa that<br/>
you can grab to make an even 40 or more. Plus, you'll get to climb up<br/>
inside a spooky stone tower and hang out in the Highlander's Halloween<br/>
decoration explosion at our place! Just sign up so we know you're<br/>
coming and we'll give you our home number in case you get lost. I<br/>
uploaded the map to a page as well, but if you want a better view, get<br/>
a Western NY Region map from Mapworks...it's the best!<br/>
<br/>
Hope to see some new (and familiar) joining us! <br/>

The (spooky) Sprite &amp; the (haunted) Highlander<br/>
<br/>
P.S.--The boxes are permanent, but the event stamp that will make the<br/>
whole set of stamps complete will ONLY be around on the weekend of the<br/>
20th!</div>
