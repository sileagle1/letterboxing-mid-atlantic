is recommended, lest ye wear Blaze Orange.  Even state laws will not <br/>
prevent the hardened poacher, but you are less likely to run into one <br/>
on Sunday.<br/>
<br/>
I would give the entire circuit about 5-6 hours (if including Pulpit <br/>
Rock).  It is a 8-9 mile round trip, has 1000 ft elevation gain and <br/>
when on the ridge line, is very rocky (makes French Creek look <br/>
paved).  Bring a lunch and if it is warm, bring a LOT of water.  I <br/>
recommend a couple quarts at least.  It is a wonderful hike, for thos <br/>
eso inclined (yes, I am a hiking masochist in the eyes of some).<br/>
<br/>
Cold front is coming this week.  Will it be cold enough to drive those <br/>
venomous biters underground, I am not sure.<br/>
<br/>
Hoep this helps,<br/>

Rock and the Pinnacle and in the last 1/2 mile to the Pinnacle along <br/>
the ridge line are all fixed in place, though just as numerous.  It <br/>
should be an easier hike in terms of comparing rocky with loose <br/>
rocky.  There is the larger elevation gain, though.<br/>
<br/>
There even is an impromptu monument in the vicinity of the Pinnacle <br/>
where people have placed rocks that they have gathered in an effort <br/>
to appease the gods of PA Rocky Trails (hopeign that the rocks will <br/>
be smitten and paved over).  It is a pile of rocks some 15 ft high <br/>
that hikers keep adding to.  Well, it was 15 ft high in 2004,and it <br/>
may be bigger now.  Talk about your SPOR.<br/>

&gt; &gt; view. Had lunch near the large cairn mentioned! There are some <br/>
&gt; other <br/>
&gt; &gt; boxes nearby too - If my middle aged mind remembers correctly.<br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; Prepare for the slithering friends (I think it was around this <br/>
time <br/>
&gt; &gt; when we did that hike). First time I met a Rattler on trail -<br/>
&gt; &gt; literally face to face. And now why I carry a snake bite kit in <br/>
my <br/>
&gt; &gt; backpack. My heart still pounds when I think of the encounter...<br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; I can share the whole boring story next time I see ya!<br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; Punk Panther<br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; All day hike and absolutely worth the journey!<br/>

&gt; &gt; &gt;    <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;   Any suggestions as to how much time to budget to make it back <br/>

                    <div id="ygrps-yiv-1728425222">Excellent report!  One of my favorite Pinnacle tales I like to tell <br/>
involves a large group of Mennonites.  We were up there one day on a <br/>
particularly clear August day (A cold front had come through a day or <br/>
so earlier) and one of the gentlemen and I were talking about how <br/>
clear everything was (you could see the mountains in NJ about 50 <br/>
miles east - they were blue that day).  He pointed to a small shiny <br/>
spot across the great valley to an area south of Kutztown on the <br/>
upslope of the Reading priong (FYI - South Mountain in Allentown and <br/>
Mt. Penn in Reading) and said "You see that shiny spot?  That is my <br/>
barn.  I got a new roof made out of aluminum and I can see if from <br/>
all the way up here!"  My guess is that the barn was about 12 miles <br/>
away, but it was very cool to see that the gentleman was vey proud of <br/>
it.<br/>
<br/>
Happy trails,<br/>
