massive affair, and takes no more then simply getting together at a <br/>
local restaurant.  I think some folks go way overboard when it comes to <br/>
getherings when it does not have to be that way.  Just put out the word <br/>
and people will show up.<br/>
<br/>
Heck, we had a dozen folks at Issac Newton's this past Sat with just <br/>
putting out the word that morning.<br/>
