 boxing in the Glorious South, and then we will stay the night at your girlfriend's, and then we will do some more boxing in the morning before we head back so you can go to work.  And at some point in there we are going to have a drink at Stack's House, because after 3 years of looking at the clues, I FINALLY know where it is."<br/><br/>"Actually, that's not a bad plan," he said (sounding much relieved).  "Schizokeet &amp; I are going to Great Adventure the day before, we can swing by &amp; pick you up.  And while we're down that way, we'll take a trip back to Bulldawg's box, because I'm pretty sure I know how to get into the logbook now....  How's 7AM sound?"<br/><br/>                                      *   *   *   *   *

 with a shopping bag to visit Old Town Manassas.<br/><br/>What fun!  We enjoyed following the clues, finding the clever locations, then--no stealth needed, just pick up the box &amp; pop it into the bag.  At the pubs we told the bartenders that we were the cleanup crew.  The bookstore decided to keep theirs, so we stamped in &amp; then did a little shopping....  then back to Becky's to sit around her table with our loot.  What a variety of beautifully crafted boxes-- kudos to the carvers!<br/><br/>Judy arrived and we handed over our booty, then the four of us went out to dinner.  At Stack's House!  I was a little worried when Judy ordered a letterbox along with her meal and the waitress didn't seem to know what that was, but after a slight delay it was located &amp; brought to our table.   How cool to see the stamps from years ago.  Another 'boxing goal
 achieved....<br/><br/>                                      *   *   *   *   *   *<br/><br/>The next day we weren't in much of a hurry to go home.  After Becky left for work, Nathan &amp; I took a walk down the trail to get the Bluemont Junction box.  It was a little farther than we'd figured, so we weren't sure we would have time for anything else.  But some inspired parking brought us within reach of the Ghost Castle of East Church Falls--a very satisfying find to finish up with!<br/><br/>So I was sorry to miss the pub crawl, but I have to say I had some terrific boxing  down south that weekend anyway!  Hope to get back there soon....<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/> <p>
