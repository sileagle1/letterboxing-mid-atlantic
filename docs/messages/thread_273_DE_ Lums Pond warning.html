Apparently, the Lums Pond staff has removed all geocaches hiden in <br/>
the park. This is what was posted to each of the cache logs:<br/>
<br/>
" August 3 by LumsPondStaff (0 found)<br/>
The staff at Lums Pond State park is asking that all Geocaches are <br/>
removed from the park. Our park is extremely environmentally <br/>
sensitive, and we fear that going off trail will compromise that <br/>
environment. We have to be responsible stewards, and this activity <br/>
can create unwanted trails and damage. We are asking that you remove <br/>
the cache within two weeks. "<br/>
<br/>
I don't know if they view letterboxes the same way was geocaches, but <br/>
my hunch is that they do.<br/>

large "hide-a-key" rocks within arms reach of the trail would be less <br/>

not that i'm a pessimist, however, once the News Journal publishes <br/>

they probably already know about letterboxing and hoping it will go <br/>

letterboxes.<br/>
<br/>
it is not out of the question that a mandate is sent to all of DE <br/>

<div> </div>
<div>I have always thought geocaching more potentially environmentally damaging then letterboxing.  I do both.  </div>
<div> </div>
<div>In geocaching the GPS only leads you to withing about 30 feet or more of the location.  From there you often find yourself tromping all over, turning over every log and rock, to find the darned thing.  I read of one method called the "spiral search".  </div>
<div> </div>
<div>I prefere in letterboxing where the clues may be clever, or mysterious, but usually once you get to the right place you're told pretty precisely where it is.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>In reality nature recovers quickly from visitors.  </div>
<div> </div>
<div>Park rangers would prefer that the park be a museum.  That people stay out and only observe from the sidelines.  But though we may go off trail we are not snowmobilers, dirt motorbikers or even mountain bikers.  As a class letterboxers clean up more trash and attract more positive nature appreciation than many other park users.  </div>
<div> </div>
<div>The park managers should recognize that this is hard to stop and it is better to join them then beat them.  If they establish clear rules for permissions and placement, we would follow them, and they would have more control over caching and boxing than they do now.  </div>
