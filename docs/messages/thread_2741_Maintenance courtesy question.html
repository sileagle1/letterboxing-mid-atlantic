Fortunately, everything was intact and in good shape (which was a <br/>
great relief to us--the carvings are stunning!) Apparently, whatever <br/>

As a matter of course, we carry extra bags with us should we see <br/>
some in bad shape along the way. But what about boxes? Would it be <br/>
considered rude if we replaced a box we felt had been chewed so <br/>

&gt;<br/>
&gt; And how about those well meaning boxers who want to take the extra <br/>
&gt; inner bags intended to double bag the log and put them on the outside <br/>
&gt; of the letterbox? I'm surprised when I find veteran boxers taking a <br/>
&gt; perfectly good freezer grade tupperware box and putting it inside a <br/>

&gt; &gt; (hint hint), as long as they told me about it.  I've had some take <br/>
&gt; the<br/>
&gt; &gt; box home!!  But that should only be in dire situations and only if <br/>
&gt; it<br/>
&gt; &gt; will be put back within a stated period (2-3 wks) so the clues could<br/>

&gt; Saturday <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; was no different, and we went straight, more or less, from box 1 <br/>
&gt; to <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; box 3, skipping box 2 (which we bactracked and found later). It <br/>
&gt; was <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; still a very enjoyable hike. Just ask my legs.<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; We got to box three, and as we looked toward the fallen tree that <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; should have hidden the box, we could see that the box had been <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; vandalized. The top &amp; bottom of the box and its contents were <br/>
&gt; spread <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; out near the tree and we feared the worst.<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; Fortunately, everything was intact and in good shape (which was a <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; great relief to us--the carvings are stunning!) Apparently, <br/>
&gt; whatever <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; woodland creature decided to open the box thought a logbook and <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; stamp weren't worth eating. <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; (We don't think it was a human vandal, because I can't think of <br/>
&gt; any <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; humans that would leave teethmarks like that, except for maybe <br/>
&gt; Bat <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; Boy, and last I heard he was up in New York somewhere.) <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; The box was in pretty good shape, if you ignore the teethmarks, <br/>
&gt; and <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; after stamping in we replaced everything and hid the box with a <br/>
&gt; big <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; (BIG!) rock on top of it. I'll tell you about Abita digging up <br/>
&gt; that <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; rock later.<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; When Abita logged the find in AQ, she included a note to the <br/>
&gt; planter <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; stating we had found the box in that shape. In the reply, the <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; planter indicated she had planned to do a check on her boxes next <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; month but did this need maintenance now? We've replied it <br/>
&gt; doesn't; <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; the box sealed up well. Heck, even the bags were in good shape.<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; As a matter of course, we carry extra bags with us should we see <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; some in bad shape along the way. But what about boxes? Would it <br/>
&gt; be <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; considered rude if we replaced a box we felt had been chewed so <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; badly by an animal (or damaged some other way) that it was no <br/>
&gt; longer <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; watertight, or should we just inform the planter and let them <br/>
&gt; take <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; care of it?<br/>

<br/>
 About 15 baggies for logbooks and stamps.<br/>
 A bunch of papaer towels for drying off salvagable innards.<br/>
 A fair bit of paper for fashioning a replacement logbook (usually <br/>
some sheets from a Jeff Foxworthy calendar).<br/>
 A spare box sometimes.<br/>
<br/>
Sometimes, we need to consider a box so trashed that we recover what <br/>
we can and contact the owner.  We did that for the "Luck Be Lady" <br/>
box near Harrisburg in early July, who was grateful to get their <br/>
logbook back.<br/>
<br/>
Box repairs are a given, any boxer worth their salt carries a kit.<br/>

know the mess we found and how we tried to improve the situation (not<br/>
adding another bag to the outside of the box if it is a water tight<br/>
box).  It is then up to them as to whether they want to replace the<br/>
outside bag.  We normally carry, bags, logbooks, decon and paper<br/>
towels.  The situation is sticky when someone uses a pencil box that<br/>
has a gaping slit in the back in its design and then puts that box in<br/>
a plastic bag.  It is only a matter of time until the entire contents<br/>
are wet.  It seems that when school starts we see more of these leaky<br/>
containers being used.<br/>
<br/>
I have to admit, the best boxers are those that contact us with<br/>
specific information about the status of our boxes after they have<br/>
found them.  We are very grateful to those that send an email<br/>
regarding the contents of the box.  Recently we received a delightful<br/>
one from Froggy JG who found two of our boxes that were previously<br/>
reported missing.  These were only 2 in a series of 6 that he found<br/>
and he gave us an in-depth report on each find. This was particularly<br/>
meaningful to us because we would have had to carve out a full weekend<br/>
to replace those boxes that were reported missing (not to mention the<br/>
time taken to re-carve).  I think it is just as important to<br/>
acknowledge the status of a box if it is in fine shape as it is to<br/>
email details about a missing/wet/destroyed box.  I find it difficult<br/>
to truly know if a box is missing because someone emails and tells us<br/>
so.  I have had numerous emails with one person who explains the<br/>
details of where they were, what they did, where they looked and they<br/>
are in the right area and can't find the box.  We go out, and there it<br/>
is, just as we left it.  <br/>

box than to have one on the outside.  The zip-locs on the outside get torn

&gt; &gt; Yup, that's it.  Prices vary considerably from $2.75 - .75 cents.  We<br/>
&gt; &gt; found the cheapest in Lewistown, PA the Posse's original hometown.<br/>

of a <br/>

not effective outdoor protection as we have seen many instances of<br/>
muddy and sloppy boxes harboring moldy ilk on the outside due to a<br/>

&gt; You've been lucky.  It's your choice what you want to do with your<br/>

&gt; &gt; I have tried to explain to some of my boxing<br/>
&gt; friends that the bag <br/>
&gt; on the outside is pointless - but some just won't<br/>
&gt; listen. I do try <br/>

&gt; it's just extra <br/>
&gt; bags and log books - which I have stood by several<br/>
&gt; boxes for several <br/>
&gt; minutes trying to decide if I should leave the full<br/>
&gt; (or damaged) <br/>
&gt; logbook and just put another in or if I should take<br/>
&gt; the full or <br/>
&gt; damaged one and mail it back to the placer. Usually<br/>
&gt; if they are wet <br/>
&gt; I will take them with me and mail them back to the<br/>

&gt; they belong too - after drying them out of course.<br/>

  was no different, and we went straight, more or less, from box 1 <br/>to 
  <br/>&gt; &gt; box 3, skipping box 2 (which we bactracked and found later). It 
  <br/>was <br/>&gt; &gt; still a very enjoyable hike. Just ask my legs.<br/>&gt; 
  &gt; <br/>&gt; &gt; We got to box three, and as we looked toward the fallen 
  tree that <br/>&gt; &gt; should have hidden the box, we could see that the box 
  had been <br/>&gt; &gt; vandalized. The top &amp; bottom of the box and its 
  contents were <br/>spread <br/>&gt; &gt; out near the tree and we feared the 
  worst.<br/>&gt; &gt; <br/>&gt; &gt; Fortunately, everything was intact and in 
  good shape (which was a <br/>&gt; &gt; great relief to us--the carvings are 
  stunning!) Apparently, <br/>whatever <br/>&gt; &gt; woodland creature decided to 
  open the box thought a logbook and <br/>&gt; &gt; stamp weren't worth eating. 
  <br/>&gt; &gt; <br/>&gt; &gt; (We don't think it was a human vandal, because I 
  can't think of <br/>any <br/>&gt; &gt; humans that would leave teethmarks like 
  that, except for maybe <br/>Bat <br/>&gt; &gt; Boy, and last I heard he was up 
  in New York somewhere.) <br/>&gt; &gt; <br/>&gt; &gt; The box was in pretty good 
  shape, if you ignore the teethmarks, <br/>and <br/>&gt; &gt; after stamping in 
  we replaced everything and hid the box with a <br/>big <br/>&gt; &gt; (BIG!) 
  rock on top of it. I'll tell you about Abita digging up <br/>that <br/>&gt; &gt; 
  rock later.<br/>&gt; &gt; <br/>&gt; &gt; When Abita logged the find in AQ, she 
  included a note to the <br/>planter <br/>&gt; &gt; stating we had found the box 
  in that shape. In the reply, the <br/>&gt; &gt; planter indicated she had 
  planned to do a check on her boxes next <br/>&gt; &gt; month but did this need 
  maintenance now? We've replied it <br/>doesn't; <br/>&gt; &gt; the box sealed up 
  well. Heck, even the bags were in good shape.<br/>&gt; &gt; <br/>&gt; &gt; As a 
  matter of course, we carry extra bags with us should we see <br/>&gt; &gt; some 
  in bad shape along the way. But what about boxes? Would it <br/>be <br/>&gt; 
  &gt; considered rude if we replaced a box we felt had been chewed so <br/>&gt; 
  &gt; badly by an animal (or damaged some other way) that it was no <br/>longer
