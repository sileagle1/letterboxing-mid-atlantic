Saturday, 10/19-20, 7-10 PM each night.<br/>
<br/>
We work on this event all year and thousands of volunteer hours go <br/>
into it.  Syner will be on the trail, scaring folks - reckon that I'm <br/>
too ugly for scaring and so I'm behind the scenes.<br/>
<br/>
I have a traveler, of course - Haunted Trail Runner - as an incentive <br/>
for letterboxers.  I will actually carry it during the trail but will <br/>
keep it handy through the December gather at Tyler for anyone who <br/>
comes to the HT.  We'll basically take your word that you came but it <br/>
would be great to trade the stamp for feedback on the trail.<br/>
<br/>
The cost is $10.00 per person and we don't recommend it for folks <br/>
younger than 12.<br/>
