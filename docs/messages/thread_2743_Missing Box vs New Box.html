still answering e-mail or interested in any way.<br/>
<br/>
The problem comes when the planter disappears. Rich and I both have <br/>
planted homage boxes using the original clues and themes and gave <br/>
credit to the originators. I think that is okay.<br/>

our dearly departed Victory LB was also a baggie. I don't assume anymore. If it
