boxers (most who I had not met yet) and meeting you and your family. <br/>
Thanks so much for coming out that day, even though you were under the <br/>
weather. <br/>
I can't wait until the great minds of you and 'X' cook up another box- <br/>
I'll be there in a NY minute! And 'X', if you see this post- we are <br/>
already planning a trip to NC next spring to hunt the boxes we missed <br/>
in September!<br/>
