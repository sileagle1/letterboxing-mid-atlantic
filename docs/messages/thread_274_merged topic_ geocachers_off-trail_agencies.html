Yes, we are very much the same as geocachers, in that we go out and <br/>
play hide-and-seek in the woods with Tupperware (or whatever that <br/>
brand was Doug recommended). And so we should pull together in our <br/>
PR attempts with park folk.<br/>
BUT, my fear is that by emphasizing the sameness, we don't <br/>
communicate the DIFFERENCE between the hobbies, and the difference <br/>
is what makes letterboxing gentler on the environment than <br/>
geocaching, and potentially more acceptible to the powers-that-be. <br/>
To say it in the words of a whiny child,"Why should WE be kicked out <br/>
when THEY did the damage?"<br/>
The difference that must be emphasized is this:<br/>
A geocache clue says, "The cache is here, at (x,y); please use the <br/>
trail over here."<br/>
A letterbox clue says "Take this trail this far, turn here, turn <br/>
there and look."<br/>
We HAVE to take the trail because we don't know where we're trying <br/>
to get to. A good planter will choose a trail avoiding environmental <br/>
damage, so even the careless finder is led along a "safe" path. A <br/>
good geocache planter will do the same, of course, but since the <br/>
finder knows exactly where he's going and has a gadget in his hand <br/>
with a big arrow saying, "It's over there," he doesn't HAVE to.<br/>
