<div><font face="Arial" size="2">That was a great day!</font></div>
<div><font face="Arial" size="2">We saw the major sights of downtown and left 
letterboxing until another trip, especially since we came in by train from 
Trenton and all the boxes are on the outskirts of town - it seems! But there is 
so much history to take in and I took way too many pictures!</font></div>
<div><font face="Arial" size="2">After the Liberty Bell and Independence Hall we 
made our way down to Carpenter's Hall and then on to the City Tavern for a well 
deserved libation and dinner. Train travel does have its perks! We'll have to 
catch the carriage rides next time - they stop running between 4PM and 6PM  
- wussies. What's a little rush hour traffic! ;)</font></div>

<div>A litte late posting this but Wednesday it was my pleasure to greet the

  my lunch hour eating cheesesteaks in my favorite little park across from
