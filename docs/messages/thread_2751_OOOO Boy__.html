<br/>
Every year we do the scavenger hunt with the Make a Wish Foundation.  It's a fun way to<br/>
spend the day roaming Baltimore, finding answers and doing a few silly things for points.<br/>
 Last year we had to pull a team member around a park on a sled.  Anyway - it's for a<br/>
great cause - lots of fun and they'd like more hunters!  See below.  This year we have<br/>
entrance fees into museuems and after the hunt theres also complimentary appetizers at<br/>
Outback.  Here's the website and the info is below.<br/>

<br/>
If anyone wants to join our team email me off list at <a href="mailto:justplaingeorge@..." rel="nofollow" target="_blank">justplaingeorge@...</a> tonight!!<br/>
 Or if you start your own team please say the Knights of Columbo referred you.  We get<br/>
points for that. :)<br/>

Message from Make a Wish:  Good morning Scavenger Hunters.  We look forward to seeing you<br/>
tomorrow, at the Museum of Industry on Key Highway, for check-in between 8 and 8:30. <br/>
There will be coffee, juice and bagels.  <br/>
<br/>
All team captains should have received the confirmation packet previously for<br/>
distribution to their team members.  In case you didnÂ’t get one, please see attached.<br/>
<br/>
This year we have an enthusiastic, yet small field of participants, so if you have any<br/>
family or friends that want to participate, have them fax in their forms today, no late<br/>
fees.  We hear the weather is supposed to be marvelous.<br/>
<br/>
