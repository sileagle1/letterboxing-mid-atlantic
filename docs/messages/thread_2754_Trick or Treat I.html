                    <div id="ygrps-yiv-1142068486">It was common in urban graveyards in days past, when the cemetary ran out of space, to dig <br/>
up the older family plots and consolidate the bones, making room for new family members. <br/>
Despite the grisly work, propriety was always observed.  Families were buried together, <br/>
husbands and wives and children with grandparents and great-grandparents.<br/>
<br/>
And then came the modern era.  Churches, under economic stress would sell off property to <br/>
fund repairs to aging buildings.  Or modern inventions, like the automobile, would require <br/>
that land be re-purposed for things like parking lots.  Often, churchyard graves would need <br/>
to be moved. Sometimes they would be moved and reburied without regard.  Coffins would <br/>
be moved en masse and reinterred as a group, familes separated for eternity.  The older <br/>
graves, really just piles of bones now, mixed up and buried in a pile; some here, some there.<br/>
<br/>
Now  if a spirit was still tied to this world through some accident or oversight or madness, <br/>
imagine their dismay at having their last mortal remains treated so casually.  Imagine the <br/>
wrath of an angry spirit when its power is at its peak on Halloween night.<br/>

                    <div id="ygrps-yiv-342961710">In this era of everyday evil - evil that is so commonplace as to be mundane - it is difficult to <br/>
gauge those things of days past which could make a soul bond itself to a location for eternity <br/>
and forego paradise.  When children can take up arms to slaughter their classmates with the <br/>
ease of battle-hardened vets, it is hard for the modern mind to imagine the spirit of a little <br/>
girl clinging to this earth because of a lost item like a toy or mirror.  And yet, there are often <br/>
simple - not horrific - reasons behind many of our local haunts.<br/>
<br/>
When one sees white-clothed men and women walking through suburban woods, when one <br/>
hears screams, we are tempted to look for a grisly reason for the haunting: a death by <br/>
disease or murder or suicide.  There are stories, for example, of a suicide in the nearby barn, <br/>
now an art center, but there are no records - no indication of anything of the kind happening <br/>
there.  Sometimes when confronted with the supernatural, people seek a reason and finding <br/>
no reason, make one up.<br/>
<br/>
All we know for sure is that there have been multiple, independent sightings of unnatural <br/>
beings walking through the woods, and screams with no apparent origin.  Beyond that, we <br/>
know nothing.  But then, if you see ghostly figures walking through the woods at night and <br/>
hear their screams, do you really need a reason to be afraid?  Very, very afraid...?<br/>

                    <div id="ygrps-yiv-1274580148">In 1957 Timothy McIlvain was an 8 year-old boy living just outside Philadelphia.  He didn't <br/>
go to school.  Deaf children didn't go to public school in those days and most people <br/>
could not afford private schools or tutors.<br/>
<br/>
Like many kids in the days before "stranger danger," Timothy would leave home in the <br/>
morning and explore his world all day long.  He would play in the creek.  He would walk <br/>
through the woods.  He would also play on the railroad tracks.  <br/>
<br/>
Of course, Timmy never heard the train coming when it struck him from behind and rolled <br/>
over him, severing his legs and his head from his body.  His head, it is believed, must have <br/>
rolled into the drainage ditch and washed away.  It was weeks before the rest of his body <br/>
was discovered and months before it was identified.<br/>
<br/>
The area changed.  Houses were built.  A typical suburban neighborhood grew.  In the <br/>
1970's the railroad tracks were removed leaving the raised bed and the path behind the <br/>
houses.  But the train still runs.   Residents along the line still awaken to the sound of the <br/>
whistle and the train still shakes the houses a bit as it passes.  Children who grew up in <br/>
the area have all played with someone who has played with the little deaf boy who often <br/>
hangs out where the railroad used to run. <br/>
<br/>
In the 1980's tragedy struck the quiet neighborhood when a local boy committed suicide <br/>
in his garage.  That boy was last seen playing basketball at a net on the street by the <br/>
entrance to the old railroad track path.  He was playing with a younger boy who looked out <br/>
of place in his old fashioned clothes.<br/>

                    <div id="ygrps-yiv-1243312221">In centuries past, the mentally ill were believed to be possessed by demons.   They were <br/>
treated in the only way available: exorcism.  Is it possible that today we believe the <br/>
possessed are mentally ill and treat them with drugs and therapy?   Is mental illness and <br/>
satanic possession the same thing?<br/>
<br/>
Imagine the plight of the mentally ill in the 19th century.  Convinced by hundreds of years <br/>
of custom and tradition that they are possessed by demons, but denied the release of <br/>
exorcism by the new science of psychology.  Confined in asylums in brutal living <br/>
conditions, subjected to experimental "treatments," the insane or possessed are left to die <br/>
slow quiet deaths in isolation when the treatments fail. <br/>
<br/>
Imagine being convinced that you are possessed by a demon.  What does the afterlife hold <br/>
for you?  An eternity of torture at the deepest level of Hell?  Convinced of this fact, what <br/>
reason would your spirit have to leave this world when death finally comes?  Given the <br/>
horrific conditions of asylum life, could some souls believe that already inhabit the <br/>
Netherworld?<br/>
<br/>
Most of the area people know about building 17.  Stories have been passed down through <br/>
generations about the things that went on inside its walls.  But the worst stories, the most <br/>
chilling tales are the stories of things that have occurred since the building was closed <br/>
down and boarded up.   Because, as many who have unadvisedly explored inside will tell <br/>
you, it has not been completely abandoned.  There are still things inside.  Things that may <br/>
be just looking for some company.<br/>

And for the record, it's a NON-event.  [There is even a Non-Event stamp.  I'm not sure but I <br/>
think it actually deducts one from your P F X E F T F B Y O B count if you take the stamp.  I <br/>
need to get a ruling first.]<br/>
<br/>
And I don't know how "big" it will be.  It's 4 boxes on a Wednesday in October.  I'm expecting <br/>
2 people and some relatives.  The stamps are pretty cool, though.... if I do say so myself.  <br/>
Wait, I always say so myself...<br/>

It was real close at one point, while scrounging around Building 17 <br/>
we were accosted by the night watchman!  He came flying over the <br/>
grass in his SUV, and immediately started the harangue about what are <br/>
you doing here, yadda yadda.  I tried to play it off that I lost my <br/>
keys earlier in the day and we were just out looking for them but I <br/>
don't think he bought it.  He kept prattling on that we shouldn't be <br/>
near the building and if we were trying to get inside we would fall <br/>
right through the floor.  It was comical, and I kept saying we are <br/>
just looking for my keys.  We were kindly asked to leave BEFORE we <br/>
found the box.  It took all we had not to go back to try it again.  I <br/>
think Celtic Cat may try it again tomorrow.  <br/>
<br/>
Natty, we had a great time!  The stamps were stunning and the places <br/>
were indeed quite creepy especially after dark.  What a great way to <br/>
spend Halloween, I had such a good time.  We weren't able to figure <br/>
out the non-event stamp, had an idea but drove around looking for a <br/>
where-wolf but alas nothing.  <br/>
<br/>
Thank you so much for this non-event, we had a blast!  I am sure <br/>
Celtic Cat can add to the commentary.<br/>

me out...) and always thought that building looked cool so I was <br/>
thrilled to get a good look at it.<br/>
<br/>
Of course, the security officer was starting his rounds as we pulled <br/>
in and we drove right by him, then turned toward 17 but this did not <br/>
interest him at all - this was around 3 PM.<br/>
<br/>
There's a lot of visitors and administrative traffic during the <br/>
day.  At night, it's pretty hard to disguise vehicle headlights - if <br/>
anyone wants to try this again tonight, I'd suggest (1) bring bail <br/>
money and (2) enter Gate 5 on foot and walk toward Building 17 - <br/>
slower but much less obvious.<br/>
<br/>
One more handy hint - generally, there is a shift change at 10 or 11 <br/>
PM so you'd encounter different officers.<br/>

&gt; Of course, the security officer was starting his rounds as we pulled <br/>
&gt; in and we drove right by him, then turned toward 17 but this did not <br/>
&gt; interest him at all - this was around 3 PM.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; There's a lot of visitors and administrative traffic during the <br/>
&gt; day.  At night, it's pretty hard to disguise vehicle headlights - if <br/>
&gt; anyone wants to try this again tonight, I'd suggest (1) bring bail <br/>
&gt; money and (2) enter Gate 5 on foot and walk toward Building 17 - <br/>
&gt; slower but much less obvious.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; One more handy hint - generally, there is a shift change at 10 or 11 <br/>
&gt; PM so you'd encounter different officers.<br/>

behind the building from the street that I can get even my fat butt through.<br/>
