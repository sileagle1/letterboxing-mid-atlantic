<div>I'm pretty sure the answer to this question is no but just in case I've missed something I thought I'd ask. I was checking some boxes for a boxing visitor today and the reply I got from someone on their lbna box (not listed on AQ) was that it was trashed a long time ago and they sure *hoped* it was "still listed on the inactive list"??? </div>
<div>Huh? Uh......is there some list I've missed? I told them I didn't know about an inactive list and that maybe they should update the clues on lbna to say it's missing and not going to be replaced. I think they are the 'placed one box and moved on to another hobby kind of "boxer"'. I can't find any other boxes by them in NY and they are not on AQ, so......</div>

<div>Yeah, I know about the basement. It didn't sound like they meant that. I looked there but it wasn't in a search. The posts aren't just the name of a box so it seems like it would take a lot of looking to try and find it. Oh well. </div>
