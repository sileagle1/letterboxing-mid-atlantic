                    <div id="ygrps-yiv-578367530">Howdy Everyone,<br/>
<br/>
I'm 1/6 of Hart x6. We live in Illinois on the boarder of Iowa in <br/>
what is known as the Quad Cities.<br/>
<br/>
We've been boxing for 11 months now, generally in the Illinois/Iowa <br/>
area. This past June we drove 2,700 miles to Oregon and back to visit <br/>
with my folks -- it was our first long haul vacation with the <br/>
knowledge of letterboxing, that really helped break up the trip.<br/>
<br/>
We have 4 kids. Skeeter age 5, Bug-a-Boo age 3 and twins who will be <br/>
2 in January. Skeeter and Bug-a-Boo are our little hikers, they love <br/>
to box and their only complaint is, "Daddy, I get bored when we don't <br/>
find the letterbox."<br/>
<br/>
Anyhow, the reason we joined this board is that sometime next year <br/>
(probably late August) we will be making a family trip to the East <br/>
Coast and spend most of our time in WV, VA &amp; NC. <br/>
<br/>
I want to take the next several months to get to know you guys over <br/>
the board, because I enjoy finding boxes much more when I have some <br/>
sense of who placed it (even if its just name recognition).<br/>
<br/>
I will probably have a few boxes to place while out there, so I may <br/>
recruit some helpful tips on a park or something where we could hide <br/>
a box. Also, once we nail down the itinerary some, I will probably <br/>
ask some advice on boxes to find.<br/>
<br/>
But that is all months in the future. I just wanted to say, "hey" and <br/>
I look forward to getting to know you.<br/>
<br/>

When you get your route and dates planned, let us know -- maybe you<br/>
will find you can meet some faces to go with the trail names.<br/>

<div>Thanks sewsowbizzy,</div>
<div> </div>
<div>I did see that NC was in a different group, that's why I apologized for the 
cross post (My message has to first go through a moderator in the SE 
group).</div>
<div> </div>
<div>While driving the other night, my wife was looking at the Atlas thinking of 
routes we would drive. I said I really wanted to go to Richmond (as my ancestor 
was held at Belle Isle prison during the Civil War) so she started reading a few 
of the town names from WV to Richmond. As soon as she said "Appomatox Court 
House" I proclaimed, "THAT'S IT" that will be our route (as I am a HUGE Civil 
War buff).</div>
<div> </div>
<div>We hope to meet whoever we can while we are there, so we will keep you 
posted :-)</div>
