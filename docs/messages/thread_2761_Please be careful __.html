gather, what with 6 days a week mail delivery.  I was especially sorry to
be missing this haunting---<span style="text-decoration:underline;">until</span> I came across the following in the Dead Letter
archives.  Postmarked from <span class="ygrps-yiv-268816468yshortcuts">Mount Savage MD</span>
1907 the envelope had obviously gotten wet as the ink for the addressee had
become illegible.<br/>
<br/>
The contents appears to be a newspaper article, but no indication of who it was
intended for or who sent it.  Anyone staying at The Castle in <span class="ygrps-yiv-268816468yshortcuts">Mount Savage</span>, or even meeting there, should take care
and at the very least do not venture out alone.  Here is what was written.<br/>
</span></i><span style="font-size:11pt;font-family:Arial;">*******************</span></p>
<p class="ygrps-yiv-268816468MsoNormal"><span class="ygrps-yiv-268816468yshortcuts"><span style="font-size:11pt;font-family:Arial;">Jack the Ripper</span></span><span style="font-size:11pt;font-family:Arial;"> is the popular name of the unknown killer who terrorized <span class="ygrps-yiv-268816468yshortcuts">London</span> 
between August and November of 1888. (He was also called the <i>Whitechapel
Murderer</i>, after the city district where he operated.) The exact details of
the case are uncertain: five women are generally considered to be definite
victims of the Ripper, though there may have been more or less. All were
strangled and then had their throats cut, and many were further mutilated with
a "surgeon's skill".</span></p><p class="ygrps-yiv-268816468MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:11pt;font-family:Arial;">The
nickname <span class="ygrps-yiv-268816468yshortcuts">Jack the Ripper</span> came from the signature
on a letter sent to a news agency during the rampage. Just when the London
Police thought they were closing in on the identity and close to an arrest. The
killings stopped as abruptly as they began. London police were unable to solve the case
or find a firm suspect. The case was closed officially in 1892, but the
mysterious anonymity of the killer has kept the case in the public eye ever
since. Some close to the investigation say the Whitechapel Murderer relocated
to America 
where he may have had business interests and opportunity to return to the
shadows.</span></p>
<p class="ygrps-yiv-268816468MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:11pt;font-family:Arial;">In December
of 1888 Alexander Thompson accepted the position of as company doctor for the
British owned Mt Savage Enameled Brick Company. Dr. Thompson bought "The
Castle" overlooking Mt Savage and made it his home for the next nineteen years.</span></p>
<p class="ygrps-yiv-268816468MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:11pt;font-family:Arial;">In January
of 1889 a series of mysterious and vicious murders began to occur in the
otherwise quiet villages of <span class="ygrps-yiv-268816468yshortcuts">Western
 Maryland</span> . Mt Savage, Frostburg, <span class="ygrps-yiv-268816468yshortcuts">Cumberland</span> and just across the Pennsylvania border at Wellersburg Pennsylvania . The details of these heinous
crimes were not released but victims were found at the Mt Savage iron works,
clay and coal mines, brick-works, railroad tracks and even near Old Row. The
local newspapers nicknamed the killer "The Savage Fiend" after the area where
he seemed to be operating. The publicity seemed to cause the murders to cease
in <span class="ygrps-yiv-268816468yshortcuts">Mt Savage</span> and increase in the other towns and
villages, but the Savage Fiend nickname stuck.</span></p>
<p class="ygrps-yiv-268816468MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:11pt;font-family:Arial;">The
killings were sporadic and there were no clues to the killer's identity until
eighteen years passed. While patrolling the brick works, a night watchman came
face to face with the Fiend himself. Darkness and a face covered in blood
prevented positive identification. The Fiend was found crouching over his
latest victim still clutching a bloody knife. The Fiend was startled and
immediately fled but the watchman gave chase and shouted for help.
He chased the Fiend thru the village banging on doors and windows along
the way to sound the alarm; "It's the fiend it's the fiend!" he called out as
he ran up the hill to the Castle walls where he lost the trail. The fiend
seemed to have vanished in thin air at the Castle owned by Dr. Thompson.</span></p>
<p class="ygrps-yiv-268816468MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:11pt;font-family:Arial;">Dr.
Thompson immediately became a prime suspect. But he was never again seen. 
When police arrived they found a note saying he had returned to England  
"on business " and was never seen again. The local newspapers had a
field day and all but convicted him in their pages. In all, there were 33
unsolved murders in the <span class="ygrps-yiv-268816468yshortcuts">Western Maryland</span> Villages
between 1889-1907.</span></p>
<p class="ygrps-yiv-268816468MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:11pt;font-family:Arial;">Unable to
contact Dr. Thompson, the Castle was eventually seized for back taxes and auctioned
off by the town council. Found among Doctor Thompson's possessions were
many surgical blades. Police were shocked to find many cards, letters and
photographs of Whitechapel.</span></p>
<p class="ygrps-yiv-268816468MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:11pt;font-family:Arial;">News of the
auction and amazing Whitechapel connection were widely publicized. October 27
1907 the local newspaper received an ominous letter written in Dr. Thompson's
hand, cursing the town for the loss of his property and vowed; " that he if it
took 100 years he would he would return to Mt Savage and to take back what was
his!" It was mockingly signed  "the Savage Fiend". </span></p>
