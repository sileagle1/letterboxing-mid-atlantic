<br/>
This Sunday afternoon (from around 2-4), I will be at the Lehigh <br/>
Valley Zoo in Schnecksville, PA for Boo at the Zoo. Boo at the Zoo is <br/>
a really fun annual event at the zoo with trick-or-treating around <br/>
the zoo, crafts, and, of course, great animals to observe all <br/>
weekend. I will be teaching and selling fall themed origami in my <br/>
other role as the Origami Wizard.<br/>
<br/>
I will be planting my two origami themed boxes on the hiking trails <br/>
surrounding the zoo if the weather cooperates this weekend. I already <br/>
planted a box at the zoo's playground:<br/>

<br/>
On Sunday, I will have a new box that you can find only if you meet <br/>
me as the Origami Wizard. HINT: My little assistant is rather round <br/>
and furry! If you want to find another stamp, you can ask Luvable <br/>
Panda (or me if she isn't available) for her new panda personal <br/>
traveler. This will be a regular personal traveler, so do your <br/>
research - the clues will be posted on Thursday afternoon. Also, keep <br/>
your eye out for a part of the zoo logo that is going to be released <br/>
as a HH.<br/>
