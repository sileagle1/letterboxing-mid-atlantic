                    <div id="ygrps-yiv-68967939">KoC did a fantastic job putting this together.  The stamps were great<br/>
feats of carving and the clues were very creative - and tricky.  But<br/>
the best trick and treat was how they managed to stop the rain and<br/>
bring out the sun for Saturday!!!  The leaves were even blazing hot.<br/>
<br/>
Having folks stay at the Castle and its Cottage was perfect. The<br/>
grounds were very conducive to planting.  After the fact I learned the<br/>
interior also held its secrets.  <br/>
<br/>
Thanks to all the folks who completed the Mayhem Mischief and joined<br/>
us  in the Cottage for 'beverages'.   <br/>
<br/>
I understand Shell does have the Haunted Frostburg Event Stamp - it<br/>
was cooling off in the cooler!!  Apparently a result of hasty pick up<br/>
and exit from the Library.  <br/>
<br/>
I had a blast!!<br/>

Back to the topic, thanks Shell for a great event.  An amazing amount of <br/>
work and preporation went into this event, and you have no idea how much <br/>
it is apreciated.  The location was wonderful, and Mt. Savage was just <br/>
such a cool little town.<br/>
<br/>
I will be uploading some of my photos shortly as well.<br/>
