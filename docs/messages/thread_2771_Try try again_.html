and was picked up by some kids or a critter.  I'm always put my boxes<br/>
too close to water!!  or on a slope!!<br/>
<br/>
Did you cover your LnL with camo duct tape (carefull, the newer tape<br/>
is more like plastic tape and doesn't tear or stick very well.  It<br/>
looks like oak leaves and the old looks darker) or just use black duct<br/>
tape.  I leave the bottom untaped because inside the box I have the<br/>
"You have found a letterbox, not a geocache - Please do not remove"<br/>
notice printed up and taped -facing out- to the bottom -- so if it is<br/>
found it won't be mistaken for trash, a bomb, or a drug drop.<br/>
<br/>
Good luck with your next plant and the one after and the one after...<br/>

really soon also. Next one nearby lasted about two years or so. Better<br/>
hiding comes with experience. Good luck. <br/>

We are going to give the box one more shot, and try to find a more <br/>
secure hiding place while still keeping it aimed at kids. (Little <br/>
