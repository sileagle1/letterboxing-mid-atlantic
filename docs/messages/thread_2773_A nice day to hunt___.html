much ..but kept up boxing in between.  Just recently I had the chance <br/>
to go boxing with Rick_in_Boca.  We hadn't gone in awhile so it was <br/>
good to meet up again.  We decided to hunt some PCLG treasure.  To <br/>
sum it up, we found the box, "Uprising" which was still in place <br/>
since 2002 and in good shape.  Good clues (make you think) on that <br/>
one.  We were only about the 6th or so to find it.  Last finders were <br/>
early in 2006 - I think it was A.Cahilly.  We also recently looked <br/>
for "Huts".  The box had not been logged on LBNA since 2004 as being <br/>
found.  We seemed to have found the spot -(another good clue set) it <br/>
matched up well to the directions and lo &amp; behold we found a <br/>
box...with its top chewed off by some sort of animal...with plastic <br/>
bag remnants but no stamp or log or anything else.  Most remanants <br/>
were covered in leaves so we spent some time checking around the spot <br/>
for any contents scattered about - but none other were found. We are <br/>
considering rejuvenating the box for future finders.... but of course <br/>
that is always a topic of debate among some people.....and just came <br/>
up on AQ again where I basically jumped back into the same (martian <br/>
maggot)conversation that took place here back in the Spring.  I had <br/>
been conversing with Brian of PCLG a few months back and was in the <br/>
process of waiting for him to decide which of their boxes I could <br/>
adopt (since as many know the group disbanded and moved away).  He <br/>
was receptive and then......the conversations stopped.  I have no way <br/>
of knowing for what reason.  Tried again recently to contact him but <br/>
have still not heard back.  So the boxes remain un-adopted by me.  I <br/>
will not attempt to adopt without permission.....not getting stuck in <br/>
that hornets nest...but as the boxes survive (if they do) I will help <br/>
to maintain whenever I am in the area(s).  Getting back to "Huts", <br/>
both Rick and I really want to maintain that great box with clues as <br/>
is..... so we'll see how it goes.  I'll defer more to him on this one <br/>
as he's been down this bumpy road before...  Hope to meet up with <br/>
more of you on the trails some time.   -John</div>

After all this time we won't get explicit permission from Brian to <br/>

<br/>
....Thanks for the kudos Rick....and for being a "die hard" right there <br/>
with me. ..But I believe it was every leaf, branch, rock and so on and <br/>
so on...LOL.  Once again,it was fun...and thanks for the conversation <br/>
that helped me to get my second and third wind since I hadn't slept due <br/>
to just getting off working an overnighter... let's go again sometime <br/>
soon (in the next couple weeks if possible before the snow comes) and <br/>
maybe some others here would like to join us...?  But be prepared....we <br/>
don't give up easily...   One more thing, I haven't forgotten that I <br/>
still owe you breakfast....</div>
