<br/>
There is not too much downtown, but if you know where to look you will <br/>
find some.<br/>
<br/>
Email Hikers and Hounds, she has a special stamp if you meet her for <br/>
lunch.  She works in a building right next to Independence Hall.<br/>
<br/>
If you search THIS yahoo group you will find some word of mouth boxes.  <br/>
Search for Freedom Trail and also Chaos at the Zoo.<br/>
<br/>
A hybrid box, "Be Prepared," is still alive and kicking, and in a great <br/>
location.  You may want to check out "Persistence Of Wink" as well, <br/>
though I don't know if that is still there.<br/>
<br/>
That is about it.  There are some boxes in parks further out in the city <br/>
and tons in the suburbs.<br/>
<br/>
Let us know when you will be in town and likely there will be some folks <br/>
that can meet up with you for exchanges.<br/>
