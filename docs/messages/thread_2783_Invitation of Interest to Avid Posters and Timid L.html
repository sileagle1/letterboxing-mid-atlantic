I already do a variety of primitive camping in conjunction with one <br/>

a rather bulky setup of canvas, cast iron, and the like.  Should I <br/>

&gt; Primitive camping means there will be no running water (no pit<br/>
&gt; toilets, showers, Christmas lights, loud radios, ATMs, vending<br/>
&gt; machines, generators or mini-golf).  You can carry water in or <br/>
bring a<br/>
&gt; filter for a nearby stream.  I realize this isn't for everyone, and<br/>
&gt; that is OK!  If you are a first timer and want to try primitive<br/>
&gt; camping, this would be a great opportunity.  This event will most<br/>
&gt; likely be in the fall.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I need to get an idea as to how many folks would even consider<br/>
&gt; primitive camping.  That will determine the location of the event <br/>
so<br/>
&gt; that I can post it on AQ.  Smaller numbers mean a more primitive <br/>
area,<br/>
&gt; larger numbers mean a location that can accommodate larger parties<br/>
&gt; (but still primitive). Comments and the level of interest in <br/>
primitive<br/>
&gt; camping for an event will determine the proper venue.<br/>

&gt; &gt; If primitive camping means I have to dig my own latrine. . . I'll<br/>

&gt; &gt; What time of year are you considering??<br/>

&gt; &gt; Usually Hikers-n-Hounds does a "Stamp'n' Camp'n'" event in June <br/>

&gt; &gt; Personally, I find surveying/polling for interest usually doesn't<br/>
&gt; &gt; work.  Just Do It.  Grab a date on AQ and be sure to include all<br/>
&gt; &gt; possible details.  Especially if there is a cut off time for <br/>
making<br/>
&gt; &gt; park reservations for camp sites.  If there is not enough <br/>
interest,<br/>
&gt; &gt; there is no shame in canceling the event with adequate notice.  <br/>
But<br/>
&gt; &gt; even if only 10 people show up -- that can be even more fun.<br/>

&gt; &gt; &gt; Hello avid posters and timid lurkers.  We are looking into <br/>
hosting a<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; Primitive Camping Event in Central PA, but need an idea as to <br/>
how many<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; folks would actually be interested in primitive camping (no <br/>
modern<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; facilities).  Many primitive camping areas are quite limited <br/>
as to how<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; many sites are available and the number of people and tents <br/>
allowed<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; and so that the best accommodations can be made, we would like <br/>
a to<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; hear from you as to whether you would consider camping a <br/>
little closer<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; to mother nature for an event.  The event would include daytime<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; letterboxing activities as well as night boxing for those <br/>
spending the<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; night.  <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; Would you be interested in a primitive camping event in <br/>
Central PA?<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; How many in your party would be interested in overnight <br/>
primitive<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; camping accommodations?<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; We realize that AQ provides Event pages, the level of interest <br/>
from<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; this board will help determine the location of the event.  Your<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; comments, suggestions and thoughts are very much appreciated.<br/>

interest.   The most desirable location will require a "walk-in" to<br/>
the camping site(s) and allow for complete privacy as no other sites<br/>
outside our group will be seen, heard or within walking distance from<br/>
the event.  Backpacking could be included in the event.  Generally,<br/>
when primitive camping, folks do not bring a bunch of stuff beyond the<br/>
necessary because you have to carry everything in.    Food (many times<br/>
dried), water, tarps, tents and maybe a small camping chair takes<br/>
priority over heavy and bulky items like coolers so that you can make<br/>
it to the site in as few trips as possible.<br/>
<br/>
From the emails I have received, I think there is enough interest to<br/>
do this at most preferred location.   <br/>
