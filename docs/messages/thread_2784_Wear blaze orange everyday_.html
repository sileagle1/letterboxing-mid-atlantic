Just wanted to pass along this info-- I guess we should wear orange <br/>
while hiking on State Game Lands everyday during hunting season- <br/>
including Sunday!  Even though it's illegal to hunt on Sunday in PA, <br/>
today Dad and I found a guy out hunting.  We were directly in his line <br/>
of fire, luckily we saw him before he saw us.  Kind of creepy, his gun <br/>
was pointed directly at some turkeys that we in the field in front of <br/>
us.  So just a heads up-- some people are idiots and hunt (illegally) <br/>
on Sunday too!  Just be careful~  Lotus</div>

bad.  <br/>

We called the Game Commission when we got back to the car, hopefully <br/>
they did something about it.  The funny thing was this guy was <br/>
hunting turkeys and as we were leaving the trail, what flew over our <br/>
heads? A turkey! Dad and I both smiled, at least the guy didn't shoot <br/>
one while we were there.<br/>
