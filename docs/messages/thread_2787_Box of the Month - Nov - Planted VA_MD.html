Box of the Month VA/DC Nov - Fluttering Around by Flutterby <br/>
<br/>
Planted in Potomac, MD at Carderock. Easy, short walk along the river. <br/>
<br/>

Penguin Patrol has this crazy idea. Instead of just a postal ring, why <br/>
not send plantable boxes? Twelve people from all over have created a <br/>
box and mailed it. We will plant them for one month for anyone to find. <br/>
Then pick it up, mail it on, and plant the next one in the same place <br/>
for the next month. <br/>
<br/>
The first box' stamp is beautiful and easy to color: Fluttering Around <br/>
by Flutterby of CT. (Fluffy Angel got excited when she saw it in my <br/>
log, but I couldn't tell her what it was then.) <br/>
<br/>
I wanted to plant it at a place easy to get to, right off the Beltway, <br/>
close to both MD and VA. I did. Ok, maybe I shouldn't have planted it <br/>
in this particular park but I couldn't resist the nice views of the <br/>
river. I think it is a spot worth visiting again and again each month. <br/>
<br/>
Let me know what you think. <br/>
