Pyramid Mountain Natural Historical Area <br/>
Planted 11/09/07 by Wingfoot &amp; Angelfoot <br/>
Montville, Morris County, New Jersey <br/>
<br/>
Clues: Easy <br/>
Terrain: Fairly Easy<br/>
Time: 45 minutes <br/>
<br/>
This series can be done in conjunction with the Pyramid &amp; Turkey <br/>
Mountain series. <br/>
<br/>
Please be discreet, as some areas of this park are heavily traveled. <br/>
<br/>
Established after a lengthy grassroots effort to preserve the area <br/>
from development, the Pyramid Mountain Natural Historic Area is over <br/>
a thousand acres of open space rich in natural and historical <br/>
resources. <br/>
<br/>
The broad mountains, flat-topped ridges and narrow valleys of <br/>
Pyramid Mountain are not only beautiful but also vital in feeding <br/>
downstream reservoirs, supplying needed aquifers and supporting <br/>
flora and fauna. The wide variety of natural habitats found within <br/>
Pyramid Mountain include fields, forests, streams, swamps, and <br/>
ponds, which support a number of plants considered uncommon to New <br/>
Jersey as well as threatened and endangered plants and animals. <br/>
Bears, snakes, foxes, and bobcats have all been seen in the park. <br/>
<br/>
Historically, Pyramid Mountain is important for its lessons about <br/>
the Lenape Indians, who flourished in this area, and the early <br/>
European settlers, who came to the area to take advantage of its <br/>
rich natural resources. <br/>
<br/>
