It shows the spoon but also ranks other removal methods and recommends<br/>
a "curved tipped jeweler's forceps" which is sold for about $19<br/>

It should be noted that squeezing a tick body can cause it to release<br/>
stuff into your system that could be harmful -- so it is not just<br/>
about pulling out the head <br/>
