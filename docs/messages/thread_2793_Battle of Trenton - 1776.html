of Trenton Boxes were still in place.  The "Victory" box placed in <br/>
10/2003 is ok - no problems.  The "Captain Moore's Insignia" box placed <br/>
in 4/2004 has not fared as well though.  The box was visited in 4/2006 <br/>
and then not again until 9/2007.  The last finder wrote that it was <br/>
waterlogged and stated that they tried to dry it on site, but it was <br/>
then left in place.  Well, today the log was still soaked through and <br/>
the book has rust stains from the rings across the pages.  Many are <br/>
barely readable.  I have taken the log in an attempt to salavage some <br/>
pages. The stamp itself is still in fairly good shape.  I dried the box <br/>
out and have left some index cards in place for anyone who may come <br/>
along to stamp in on.  I was not preapred with spare logs today.  I <br/>
will be out in the next week or so to replace the log and return the <br/>
salvaged pages to keep the history of the box going. I may also switch <br/>
the box for a lock &amp; lock. If anyone knows the original placer "D-man" <br/>
and could let them know the status of the box it would be helpful.  It <br/>
does not seem that the box has been checked on in the last year.  I did <br/>
send an e-mail through the LBNA link.  Thanks, John</div>
