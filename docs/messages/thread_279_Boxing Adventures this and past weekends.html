<br/>
I hope that Charley did not torment y'all too much.  He managed to <br/>
bypass Allentown, as I was fearing that he would be the first to find <br/>
the South Mountain Series and Robin Hood's hat.<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, remember when Fleur de Lis was going up to Lawn Guyland to <br/>
visit her Great Aunt.  Did she find any boxes up there?<br/>
<br/>
Hoping everybody is safe and happy,<br/>

an art store, but the store closed at 7 pm, and by the time we were <br/>
ready it was 6:30 - knowing good ol' Lawn Guyland traffic, we never <br/>
would have made it on time!<br/>

I did get to check on Black Diamond and Mother this weekend. There <br/>
were gunshots, and by the looks of the last 3 people at Black <br/>
Diamond, it wasn't the first time. They scared the crapola outta me, <br/>
so I put a new disclaimer on the clues. <br/>

So much for Charley! All talk and no wind..at least not up this way...<br/>
