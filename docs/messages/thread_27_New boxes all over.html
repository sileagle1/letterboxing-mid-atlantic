box NJ Physiography series are out. Someone once said you need to <br/>
know your intended audience and have a purpose for boxes. Well, <br/>
these are out there to drag folks, especially Jersey folks, clean <br/>
from one end of the state to the other to see how varied it is! If <br/>
you use the suggested link, you can learn an awful lot about the <br/>
rocks under our feet and how the affect the shape of the land. <br/>
Otherwise.... you just get 5 more on your F count and a multicolored <br/>
map of NJ.<br/>
I'll try to get the last box out on Wednesday.<br/>
