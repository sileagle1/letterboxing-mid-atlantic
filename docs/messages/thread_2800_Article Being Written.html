<br/>
I was contacted by a writer at a local paper who had found one of our <br/>
family's letterboxes (we're relatively new) and was interested in <br/>
talking to me about an article that she's writing.  I've seen on the <br/>
boards that people have been upset about press coverage in the past so <br/>
don't want to make any faux pas with what I say or upset any old-timers <br/>
or people who are way more into this than we are.  Could anyone provide <br/>
me with a little direction as to what should vs. should not be said?<br/>
<br/>
Thanks!<br/>

not be able to please everyone.<br/>

letterboxers would rather not have published, is apt to be safer <br/>
than stonewalling, which only provokes more curiosity (see Nixon, <br/>
Richard M).  Most journalists will respect a few boundaries in <br/>
exchange for good basic information - better that than to have the <br/>
writer discover stuff, which is inevitable, and put it all into <br/>
print.<br/>

If no one speaks, they won't run the article.  Without a guide, they can't run pictures.  It's <br/>
not a news story, it's fluff.  They won't do the story if no one cooperates.  History shows <br/>
even with co-operation of experienced 'boxers they get it wrong.  A conspiracy of silence <br/>
speaks louder than words.<br/>
<br/>
Do you want controlled high-quality growth in the game?  Tell friends.  Speak to <br/>

&gt; Sorry guys but you're wrong. Remeber that little thing called the Smithsonian Article? Plus <br/>

Yes.  And look what happened.  One article set a continent on fire.  We've more than doubled <br/>
the number of boxes in Dartmoor- ever - and spread them to just about every county in the <br/>
US in less than 10 years.  Imagine it doubling again here in the US.<br/>
I firmly believe that this game can only continue as long as it remains below the radar.  When <br/>
the general public becomes aware of letterboxing it will be banned in all the places where we <br/>
now commonly play.  There is a tipping point where we will cross into public consciousness <br/>
and the game will either become corporate or banned.  I don't know where that tipping point <br/>
is, but I'd like to stay away from it as long as possible.<br/>
<br/>
I understand how this game grabs you.  I understand the desire for more boxes... more <br/>
boxes... more boxes.  I am not asking that we keep it a secret.  Growth is good.  We need <br/>
growth - but slow, controlled growth.<br/>
<br/>
That is why I will continue to urge restraint when dealing with the mass media.</div>
