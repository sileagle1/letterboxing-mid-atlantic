Honestly I will not have time to reply to everyone. I am still at work and tonight have a ton of stuff still to do. 60 grill cheese sandwiches to cook plus two different kinds of soups to make. Some last minute shopping,packing and carving. Everything has been posted on AQ for months and I have updated it so I'll have to direct you there. Day gather is Family Friendly (#1 question) Night Gather is for adults. Please bring firewood, some food to share (no electric though for crockpots, etc.) and dress warmly. Beyond that, check AQ. Thanks and hope to see you there,</div> <div> </div> <div>Dude and Irene - H&amp;H</div><p>
