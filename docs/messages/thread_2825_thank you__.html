gathering fantastic!<br/>
<br/>
It was great to see everybody, to reconnect with old friends and meet<br/>
a few new people.  <br/>
<br/>
It was great to finally find four boxes that had eluded me at Tyler<br/>
for years.  (BIG thanks to Celtic Cat, MizScarlet, Leafcutters, Lotus,<br/>
Lightnin' Bug, GeckoSpot, and Magical Mystery Man for all the help!)<br/>
<br/>
It was great to enjoy such good food, such good boxes, such a good<br/>
fire, and such wonderful people.<br/>
<br/>
THANK YOU.  What a wonderful way to start my favorite month!<br/>
