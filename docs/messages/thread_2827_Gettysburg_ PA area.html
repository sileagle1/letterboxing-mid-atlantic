We're on the move again, this time to Gettysburg, PA next weekend.<br/>
Does anyone have any insightful conversation or recs for that area?<br/>
We're planning on visiting York as well since we see a concentration<br/>
of boxes listed there. Any advice will be much appreciated!<br/>
Thanks!<br/>

much fun in that general area.  You may wish to check with SewSoBuzzy <br/>
and Hikers and Hounds for recommendations.  They'd be more than <br/>
pleased to hear from you.<br/>

BTW, the bees had long left that hive.<br/>

A few weekends back the RedHatBox'rs rented a cabin in Pine Grove<br/>
Furnace and did the "Sunset Rocks" box [it's on LB.org Cumberland<br/>
County , Shippensburg]<br/>
<br/>
It was a hike straight UP the side of a mountain.  But this ol'broad<br/>
actually made it to the top and with screaming knee caps back down. <br/>
The view from the top was gorgeous -- maybe less so now with all the<br/>
leaves gone??  Which will also make the trail slippery having fallen<br/>
wet leaves to contend with.  Just be carefull and go for it!<br/>
<br/>
We only did the one box and then we took the 2.5 hr audio/guided bus<br/>
tour around the Gettysburg battle field.<br/>

                    <div id="ygrps-yiv-485543660">I definitely recommend hiking poles for Sunset Rocks, especially this <br/>
time of year! It is a great view, even in winter (when I got the <br/>
box), though I imagine Fall must be a glorious sight from the top.<br/>
<br/>
Kings Gap Environmental Center is also in the general area of Sunset <br/>
Rocks.  "Following the Paw Prints" is there--I've never found it, so <br/>
I can't vouch for it.  <br/>
<br/>
Don't forget to visit Hanover in addition to York--there have been so <br/>
many additions to Hanover in the years since Silent Doug planted Mary <br/>
Ann's Furnace (and it's closer to Gettysburg, to boot, if time is an <br/>
issue).<br/>
