<div> </div>
<div>Oh, except Saturday AM we met Zed Boxing and Little Stinker at Philly Int'l to welcome them to our area and do an image exchange. And I had my work friend Mike Smith with me who doesn't have a car so usually only gets to box with me. Since we were so close to Delaware we decided to hunt for just a few boxes because I told Mike I really didn't have time to box this weekend. So we found Just Passin' Thru, Yummy, Brandywine Bluebird and Future Discovery Road Runner. Got home around 8PM!! Stopped and bought some wine and decided to spend just a little time on my log. Around midnight after way too much wine crashed out with Mr. Irene. Woke up today with the "bottle flu" and was glad I was REALLY not going to do any boxing today. Until I read my email...The Raindears wanted to meet at Nockamixon to plant our co-project, a Lord of the Rings series. So, had to wake Carvin' Carmen, he and I threw the boxers together and Dude and I boogied up to north to mmet the Raindears. Got the boxes
 planted and exchanged with them again (we didn't all get each others images at Leap Day). Saw a Dollar Tree on the way home, ran in and spent about $30 on boxing stuff (Silent Doug, they really own you a paycheck for the advertising you have given them). And just got in to start my non-letterboxing weekend stuff. Sure glad I decided to blow off letterboxing this weekend....</div><p>

Stinker at Philly Int'l to welcome them to our area and do an image exchange.
And I had my work friend Mike Smith with me who doesn't have a car so usually
only gets to box with me. Since we were so close to Delaware we decided to hunt
for just a few boxes because I told Mike I really didn't have time to box this
weekend. So we found Just Passin' Thru, Yummy, Brandywine Bluebird and Future
Discovery Road Runner. Got home around 8PM!! Stopped and bought some wine and
decided to spend just a little time on my log. Around midnight after way too
much wine crashed out with Mr. Irene. Woke up today with the "bottle
flu" and was glad I was REALLY not going to do any boxing today. Until I
read my email...The Raindears wanted to meet at Nockamixon to plant our
co-project, a Lord of the Rings series. So, had to wake Carvin' Carmen, he and
I threw the boxers together and Dude and I boogied up to north to mmet the
Raindears. Got the boxes planted and exchanged with them again (we didn't all
get each others images at Leap Day). Saw a Dollar Tree on the way home, ran in
and spent about $30 on boxing stuff (Silent Doug, they really own you a paycheck
for the advertising you have given them). And just got in to start my
non-letterboxing weekend stuff. Sure glad I decided to blow off letterboxing
this weekend....</span></font></p>

&gt;  <br/>
&gt; I'll post my clues in a little while. I just had the worst scare <br/>
today.<br/>
&gt; Carvin' Carmen was in a bad accident on his way to work this <br/>
morning and had<br/>
&gt; to be taken to the hospital in an ambulance. His Dad and I rushed <br/>
over there<br/>
&gt; after I got the call. He is okay but going to be real sore. <br/>
Sprained neck,<br/>
&gt; lacerations from his seat belt and a possible broken nose, but <br/>
otherwise<br/>
&gt; okay. So are the folks in the other car. He's home now and I keep <br/>
going into<br/>
&gt; his room to look at him and cry (which is REALLY getting on his <br/>
nerves) but<br/>
&gt; I can't help myself. I keep thinking how badly things might have <br/>
turned<br/>
&gt; out...I might have had to start carving our stamps! Egad!! No, I'm <br/>
kidding<br/>
&gt; but I am still shaking and weepy. I'll post later tonight. right <br/>
