hear it is alive and well, I will have to find some time to go after it.<br/>
<br/>
I think winter is a pretty good time for boxing, and yes, even in the <br/>
snow.  No bugs, and I can't stand the heat.  So long as my feet stay <br/>
warm I am all set.<br/>

without the green head flies...and it's a good spot.  But an even <br/>
closer one for you is "Shad Happens".  It is still there - not visited <br/>

I was only the 3rd finder.  -John<br/>
