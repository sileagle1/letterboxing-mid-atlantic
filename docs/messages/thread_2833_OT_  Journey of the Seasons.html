<div><font face="Arial" size="2">At least one boxer mentioned to me that they 
wanted to see the art show Journey of the Seasons, for which I had offered a 
stamp as a hook, but missed the show.  Unfortunately, I forgot who.  
For anyone who is interested, about 1/4 of the show is hanging at Sinclair's 
Cafe, on Main Street, in Newark, DE, until December 31st.  The stamp has a 
permanent home (as permanent as any box can be) elsewhere in New Castle County 
and can be found on LBNA and AQ.</font></div>
