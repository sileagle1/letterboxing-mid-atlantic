I am going camping outside of Haines Falls, NY this upcoming weekend <br/>
and I am looking for boxes in that area.  On the LBNA site there is <br/>
one for boulber rock but it also mentions a box at Kaaterskill falls <br/>
and another named North point LB but I could not find clues on the <br/>
LBNA site for these boxes.  So does anyone have these box clues or <br/>
know where I could find them or does anyone know any more boxes in <br/>
this area.  Thanks in advance to everyone.<br/>
<br/>
