                    <div id="ygrps-yiv-234154693">I just went over to GL to look at the rules and choice of<br/>
boxes/events/exchanges for 2008 and haven't a chance.<br/>
<br/>
Hey LBMA folks - this is fun idea for the cold winter months -- not<br/>
that weather stops LBMA'rs from hitting the trail!!<br/>
<br/>
For those that don't already belong to GL -- here is the gist:<br/>
Organizer has created a BINGO Card Format, instructions, and list of<br/>
block entries (in lieu of numbers) in the following categories:<br/>
<br/>
Letterboxes<br/>
Trail Names<br/>
Events<br/>
General Terms<br/>
<br/>
There are 125 choices for 2008, laid out in columns B.I.N.G.O<br/>
<br/>
Player prints a card (table in word) and puts 25 entries (in<br/>
appropriate column) on their playing card which is mailed into the<br/>
organizer along with $1/postage and a prize contribution.<br/>
<br/>
The hitch is: to list a letterbox, trail name or event -- you have to<br/>
have found, exchanged, or attended!!  Which is why I can't play the GL<br/>
game %^(<br/>
<br/>
Organizer posts one of the 125 'words' each morning and if it is on<br/>
your pre-entered card you daub it (BINGO lingo).<br/>
<br/>
The usual winning categories apply (Full card, 4 corners, straight<br/>
line, "X", perimeter).<br/>
<br/>
If this is of interest to LBMA -- I'm game for setting it up to run<br/>
beginning Feb 1.  As a first time - we could skip the mailing bit and<br/>
you just email me your block choices before Feb 1 for verification<br/>
when you call BINGO.  In fact in the spirit of DE GAMES - I would call<br/>
it TRAIL %^)<br/>
<br/>
As for the prizes, in lieu of organizing a gather in 2008, I would<br/>
contribute 4x6 pink stuff for each winner -- only you would have to<br/>
meet me at a gather in 2008 to retrieve it -- that stuff is heavy!<br/>
<br/>
To be real fun, we would need at least 25 players.  So I will set up<br/>
in a few minutes a POLL - "LBMA TRAIL" - just check YES and your name<br/>
will appear as having 'voted'.  If there will be multiple players per<br/>
'family' - I'll include some number choices - just 'vote' for the<br/>
number playing.   When 25 have 'voted' - I'll generate the details.<br/>
<br/>
NEED votes by Jan 7 so there is time to prepare and for you to<br/>
select/email your card choices.<br/>
