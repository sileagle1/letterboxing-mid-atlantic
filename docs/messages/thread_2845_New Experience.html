thought I'd share. We were pulled over by the police.<br/>
<br/>
Parts of the Seneca Creek Greenway Trail (http://www.mc-<br/>
mncppc.org/trails/trails_maps/Seneca.shtm) pass near our house and <br/>
we're slowly hiking the whole thing, a bit at a time. Christmas Eve, <br/>
we started at a part near our home and headed in a direction we <br/>
hadn't been before. As we came to a point we had been to before <br/>
(letterboxing from the other direction, where we orignally turned <br/>
around), we decided to try to find a letterbox we hadn't found <br/>
before. Abita still had the clues for the box with her, so we kinda <br/>
split up looking for the hollow stump...or something. The landmark <br/>
mentioned in the clue, you know?<br/>
<br/>
I heard a bit of a commotion from the hill above us, and I looked up <br/>
to see two of Montgomery County's finest, one of whom was losing her <br/>
footing and falling into a fence, while her partner asked if she was <br/>
alright. I would have laughed, except they were armed and I don't <br/>
like to consider myself stupid; instead, I just yelled out something <br/>
along the lines of, "Be careful, officers! There's lots of barbed <br/>
wire 'round here!"<br/>
<br/>
She picked herself up and I saw she had a citation book in her hand, <br/>
and she yelled down at me, "You're wearing (blaze) orange--that's <br/>
good! You're not hunting are you, although I see you're not!" and I <br/>
confirmed we, indeed, were not. Abita later noted a trained officer <br/>
could probably tell my hiking pole wasn't a rifle, even if I hadn't <br/>
had one end stuck in the ground, and we speculated on what the heck <br/>
that was all about because they disappeared right after that.<br/>
<br/>
My best guess is that someone saw some people in blaze orange <br/>
(namely, us) along the trail from their house (you can frequently <br/>
see houses thru the trees hiking these trails...stupid over-<br/>
development) and called the cops on us. <br/>

                    <div id="ygrps-yiv-2016584283">Wow, what a story! I had a similar experience in '06 down Silver Spring way. I was trying for <br/>
the old "National Park Seminary" box, which had been planted on the incredibly decrepit and <br/>
spooky grounds of a former girls' school near Walter Reed hospital. [I believe currently this <br/>
property is being renovated for condos, etc.]<br/>
<br/>
It was noontime on a weekday, when the place was at its least spooky, but that is not saying <br/>
much. I followed the clues but felt I was in some danger from the nature of the place, the <br/>
abandoned buildings, overgrowth, etc.<br/>
<br/>
A couple of older teen boys ran past me at one point, hightailing it through all the vines, up <br/>
and down the hills, etc. Minutes later came the cops, several cars full. They questioned me <br/>
about whether I had seen any "activity." They had followed the teens, suspected drug dealers, <br/>
into the place---which as it turns out was a favorite hiding place for them.<br/>
<br/>
At that point I got my butt out of there. By the way, I found the site of the box, and it was <br/>
long, long gone. The clue's still on LbNA, but believe me, the box no longer exists. I am glad <br/>
to see I was the last attempt on this one!<br/>
