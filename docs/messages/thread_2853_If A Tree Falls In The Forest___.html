                    <div id="ygrps-yiv-371898297">I, personally, would like to see a tree fall in the forest. Once, <br/>
though, is good enough for me, and certainly from a distance greater <br/>
than a few inches.<br/>
<br/>
I did see a large branch fall from a tree. Coincidentally, it was <br/>
near where Abita and I were pulled over by the police, on a <br/>
different day. We both heard the rather loud cracking and turned <br/>
toward the sound in time to see a huge branch falling to the ground. <br/>
<br/>
I thought it was pretty cool; Abita thought it was pretty scary. I <br/>
pointed out it's cool from a safe distance and would definitely be <br/>
scary if it were directly above our heads. And I resolved should I <br/>
ever hear a sound that loud again and I can't see what's causing it <br/>
in front of me, it must be above me and the best course of action <br/>
would be something along the lines of Mr. Bumpo's, only without the <br/>
screaming like a little girl. I plan to substitute cursing like a <br/>
sailor. <br/>
