<p>Hi all,<br/><br/>I don't post much but thought I'd give my thoughts on this. 
  I think <br/>most of you are right in that LTC's, Postals, etc... have nothing 
  to <br/>do with Letterboxing.<br/><br/>But in reality, what do personal 
  travelers, special stamps that you <br/>share with friends, etc., have to do 
  with letterboxing either? I <br/>mean, other than traditional letterboxing, 
  it's all just icing.<br/><br/>And I think that's my point: Sure, none of this 
  extra crap really <br/>is letterboxing, and yeah, AQ gets silly sometimes, but 
  who cares? <br/>There will still be people, plenty of them in fact, who just 
  put <br/>boxes out there in the woods. I would quit this hobby if there 
  <br/>weren't. But why get in a huff about the folks who want to do extra 
  <br/>stuff with stamps? LTC's are a way to share art, as are postals and 
  <br/>the other stuff. If they're not for you, cool. If they are, 
  <br/>whatever.<br/><br/>I'm glad I happen to be part of the LBNA retinue where 
  there are so <br/>many skilled planters. If I were stuck somewhere where there 
  was a <br/>bunch of people only in it for the icing I'd quickly fall out of 
  <br/>this hobby. I think we should count our blessings rather than point 
  <br/>out the wierdness that other folks do. (That's a grammatically awful 
  <br/>sentence but I'm unwilling to change it right now.)<br/><br/>Mr. Yuk (4 
  LTC's and some postals to my credit, but would rather <br/>figure out a Mystery 
  any day.)<br/><br/>--- In <a href="mailto:lbma%40yahoogroups.com" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">lbma@yahoogroups. com</a>, "Lightnin

  <br/>&gt; LB<br/>&gt; <br/>&gt; <br/>&gt; <br/>&gt; &gt; You too? I just don't get 
  it. How does a card with a stamp <br/>image <br/>&gt; on it <br/>&gt; &gt; have 
  anything to do with letterboxing? I think AQ has lost some <br/>&gt; focus 
  <br/>&gt; &gt; and is becoming even more of a waste of time in ways.<br/>&gt;
