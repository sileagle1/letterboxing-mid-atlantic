Subject: [lbma] Geo-cache/Letterboxing both???<br/>
<br/>
I was just wondering how many people geo cache and letterbox. I just got a<br/>
GPS and was wondering if I would be crossing over to the dark side if I geo<br/>
cache too (yes it was a star wars christmas at our house - I never thought a<br/>
5 year old's toys would be the highlight of<br/>
christmas)<br/>

I'm wondering if I still want to try it.  Maybe if there is one near a <br/>
