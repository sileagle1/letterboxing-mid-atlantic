(you'll need to read the instructions to understand this) because <br/>
they hadn't found any of the boxes, made any of the exchanges, or <br/>
attended any of the events I had listed in the different columns.<br/>
<br/>
So to accommodate everyone, the choices have been updated to include <br/>
six(6) in each column from which to pick.<br/>
<br/>
Hopefully I won't have cards coming in with just GENERAL choices -- <br/>
or the risk of duplication increases.  <br/>
<br/>
You can always come to the Pennsyltucky Stagger, New Hope PA, next <br/>
Sat Jan 12 to collect a few of the exchanges and the event choice!!!<br/>
