<p>Idea for disabled son to be able to carve, at the<br/>beauty supply store 
  there is this little tool used for<br/>cuticles, it looks like a little gouge 
  but is not<br/>really sharp but will cut soft carving material. I<br/>used it 
  for my Cub scouts. Even the kid with hemophila<br/>was able to carve with no 
  trip to the ER.<br/>As for the trading card thing, no one will ostrasize<br/>you 
  for it but my point is it is not letterboxing.<br/>They are ATCs (artist 
  trading cards) done by boxers.<br/>And yes I carve stamps for other purposes 
  that can't<br/>be considered boxes, exchanges, event stamps ect. And<br/>it's 
  all in good fun. <br/><br/>--- ASLReBecca &lt;<a href="mailto:abcasl%40cox.net" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">abcasl@...</a>&gt; wrote:<br/><br/>&gt; To be 
  honest, we were overly excited when we saw the<br/>&gt; LBTCs. Yes, we are 
  new<br/>&gt; at letterboxing, and our daughter who is only four<br/>&gt; helped 
  carve her own<br/>&gt; stamp (Spiderman head). Our son, on the other 
  hand,<br/>&gt; is physically disabled.<br/>&gt; To give him a blade would mean 
  explaining to<br/>&gt; hospital employees about<br/>&gt; letterboxing and how 
  our son does not have suicidal<br/>&gt; tendencies. There are<br/>&gt; only so 
  many different ideas for a teen that doesn't<br/>&gt; make his stamp 
  look<br/>&gt; like he's a toddler, so he has taken to this LBTC<br/>&gt; with 
  utter excitement. So<br/>&gt; I'm hoping we won't be ostracized because we want 
  to<br/>&gt; participate with the<br/>&gt; LBTCs. We are planting our fist box 
  really soon and<br/>&gt; now our son feels he<br/>&gt; can contribute AND is 
  excited to think his LBTC<br/>&gt; might be taken by someone,<br/>&gt; so that a 
  piece of him can travel!<br/>&gt; <br/>&gt; Smiles,<br/>&gt; <br/>&gt;

  <br/>&gt; A fellow boxer friend of mine mentioned to me that<br/>&gt; she enjoys 
  the LTCs<br/>&gt; because where she lives the boxes are few and<br/>&gt; FARRRRR 
  between. Boxing is<br/>&gt; sparse in some of them thar hills. So she's 
  started<br/>&gt; doing the LTCs as a<br/>&gt; creative outlet for want of having 
  boxes to do. And<br/>&gt; she has done some<br/>&gt; totally awesome traditional 
  plants so it's not like<br/>&gt; she doesn't want to box.<br/>&gt; Not very 
  people anywhere near her box so it's gets a<br/>&gt; little 
  discouraging<br/>&gt; sometimes. I can kind of understand that. I'm 
  sort<br/>&gt; of caught between areas,<br/>&gt; further upstate NY and further 
  down the east coast. <br/>&gt; <br/>&gt; <br/>&gt; <br/>&gt; There's nothing wrong 
  being encouraging. :)<br/>&gt; <br/>&gt; <br/>&gt; <br/>&gt; missmoon<br/>&gt;
