DH went to the brewery back when he lived in ND - he'd come past it on
his drive back to MD. We've just recently started being able to get it
here, but only two kinds, and not the Red. :-( Oh, well... And I have a
sister in WI and she refuses to send us any - some likely story about
interstate laws governing shipments of alcohol... yeah, right! ;-&gt;<br/>

<div>Cool! I was thinking of you guys yesterday. I was talking to
a client from Chippewa Falls, WI. Home of the best beer in the world!
And I smiled thinking about how you brought me some all the way from
there onyour last trip. It sure was tasty....I have GOT to get out
there some day. If only Dude could fly too&lt; but he's way too old (17
this year!) and it would be too stressful for him.<br/>

<div>... would be lucky for us! We're playing the third annual
Great Lakes <br/>
Letterboxing BINGO game again this winter. It started JAN 1 but we <br/>
haven't had a single word called on either of our cards... until <br/>
today. Sure enough it was Hikers &amp; Hounds! Maybe it's the start of
a <br/>
lucky streak?<br/>
