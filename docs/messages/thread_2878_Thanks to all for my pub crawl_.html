Schizokeet, et al for this excellent event.<br/>
<br/>
We made the rounds this morning and found the boxes that we couldn't <br/>
get last night, getting to exchange and hang out with Grizzly Girl &amp; <br/>
Shadow Dancer a bit (sorry about that cootie, though in fairness, you <br/>
tried to cootie first LOL).<br/>
<br/>
The bartender at Lambert Station told us that she chatted with staff <br/>
from a few other bars last night and they would have liked to have <br/>
been involved with the crawl, so it sounds as though we were <br/>
appreciated.  River Horse saw over 50 visitors yesterday, which is <br/>
unusually high for them.<br/>
<br/>
Syner and I rescued the Indian this morning.  When we reached the <br/>
spot, the bench was occupied by a man and his dog, so we killed some <br/>
time in the store but he was still there.  <br/>
<br/>
Finally, we started to look for the box anyway - then the <br/>
conversation about a "scavenger hunt" and he pulled the stamp out of <br/>
his pocket.  It had been in the open, on the sidewalk, so he picked <br/>
it up - no idea why he decided to take it or what he planned to do <br/>
with it.<br/>
<br/>
When we left, man and dog were gone, Indian remained (maybe best to <br/>
wait for the movie to come out).<br/>
