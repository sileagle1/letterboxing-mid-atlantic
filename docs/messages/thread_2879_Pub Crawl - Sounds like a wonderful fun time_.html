     Thank you for a wonderful event, I had a<br/>
blast!!!!I had no idea what a Pub crawl would entail<br/>
but this was perfect to me. My team "the late<br/>
arrivals" did horrible at trivia but there really was<br/>
only 2 of use into the trivia thing. Next time we'll<br/>
do better! The Pubs,the six pack and the bonus boxes:<br/>
what a nice variety!<br/>
  Oh by the way I think my sister was one of the<br/>
insistant one's bugging you about putting the clues on<br/>
Atlas Quest. Ignore her, we all do!!!!! She had a bit<br/>
too much to drink and got a little loud. <br/>
  Thanks again, you put a lot of time and effort into<br/>
the crawl and we really appriciated it! Snowflake<br/>
