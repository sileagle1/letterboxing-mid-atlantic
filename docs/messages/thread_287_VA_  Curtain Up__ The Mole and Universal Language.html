Just a status report on these 3 that I tried tonight.<br/>
<br/>
Universal Language was a lot of fun to translate, and then quick to <br/>
find.  Nice little park too.  Box had standing water in it, and the <br/>
front half of the logbook was soggy--lots of ink spread on some of <br/>
the older entries, unfortunately.  Baggie with stamp had water in <br/>
it.  I replaced both baggies, dried out letterbox, I pulled out 5-6 <br/>
soaked, blank pages to help cut down the moisture content.  If more <br/>
people try this one over the next few days, more moisture will be <br/>
released...<br/>
<br/>
Curtain UP!  Concert tonight, so I had to work around the clues a bit <br/>
to get around the closed off area at the Filene Center.  I found the <br/>
area where the box should be, and had no luck locating it at all.  <br/>
From the look of the area, they have had some flooding, and I think <br/>
this is lost.<br/>
<br/>
The Mole:  Same story.  I found the spot, I'm pretty sure, but again <br/>
lots of evidence of flooding.  I invested a lot of time, blood and <br/>
dignity (fell in the mud) to find these last two!  <br/>
<br/>
Anyway, it was a fun night, and lots of interesting parks in NoVA.  <br/>
If anyone else has seen the last 2 recently, please advise and I'll <br/>
look again next week, but I believe they are history.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks,<br/>
