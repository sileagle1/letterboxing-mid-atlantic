My boxes will be posted but the detailed clues will not, they will have to be emailed by me opun request. New Hope is a VERY busy area and the bonus boxes will not last long unless folks are extremely discreet. I believe the cigar store indian is already gone. A local noticed all of the hub-hub around the box and went and snagged the stamp thinking it was part of a scavenger hunt open to the general public. It was resuced by a boxer and returned to it's spot, but I do plan to go back and get it and move it.</div> <div> </div> <div>The pub boxes will be posted openly. The idea is to generate business for the pubs if they agree to keep them for me. River Horse and the rest of the bonus boxes will require an email to me for the clues in the hopes that they will last more than a just a few weeks.</div> <div> </div> <div>Since the clues have been posted
 print them out now if you want them until they have been removed, After that just shoot me an email. I will get these up on both sites this weekend. Also, I do plan to move some boxes to better locations so the clues will be wrong after that.<br/><br/><b><i>gallant_rogue &lt;gallant_rogue@...&gt;</i></b> wrote:</div> <blockquote><span title="qreply"> <blockquote class="ygrps-yiv-1322206991replbq" style="PADDING-LEFT:5px;MARGIN-LEFT:5px;BORDER-LEFT:#1010ff 2px solid;"> <div id="ygrps-yiv-1322206991ygrp-text"> <div>I was looking for an aquatic monster!
