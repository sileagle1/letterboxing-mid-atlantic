<br/>
We are so looking forward to seeing all of you this weekend. A <br/>
couple of things to mention -<br/>
<br/>
* Please park in the back of the fire house - if a call comes in <br/>
while we are there, we want the firemen to have quick &amp; easy access <br/>
to the building.<br/>
<br/>
* We are not allowed in the room where the firetrucks are  housed. <br/>
Nope, no way, no can do! <br/>
<br/>
* There will be traditionals to be found, some puzzles to be solved -<br/>
 not anything like that special "Snow Flake" created by our PA <br/>
friend -holy moly -, maybe a simple game or 2 to play to earn / find <br/>
the stamps.<br/>
<br/>
* Mudflinging Fools has sent us a travelling event stamp for our <br/>
enjoyment as well.<br/>
<br/>
See you Saturday!<br/>
