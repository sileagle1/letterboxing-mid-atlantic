Bearing in mind that I tend to agree with a previous statement from someone<br/>
else that AQ is losing it's focus and my own present statement that too<br/>
many often unecessary bells and whistles are spoiling what it started out<br/>
as, (so I pretty much agree with what you are saying), along with some<br/>
other issues I have with said site, what do you mean by "internet portal"<br/>

I posted a few boxes on AQ just as a test run, and found it annoying <br/>
that it was so linked to the map thingy that I had to list a box as <br/>

&gt;<br/>
&gt; I like it. Luddite Boxers Mid-Atlantic. Sign me up.<br/>
&gt; I posted a few boxes on AQ just as a test run, and found it annoying <br/>
&gt; that it was so linked to the map thingy that I had to list a box as <br/>
&gt; mystery because it couldn't find Bear Mountain. I've been too lazy to <br/>
&gt; bother pulling the clues.<br/>
&gt; (The "nearest box" feature also annoyed me, as it ignores the fact <br/>
&gt; that I do not fly like the crow; there's wide river with toll bridges <br/>
&gt; in these here parts.)<br/>

&gt; &gt; A variety of reasons.  In my case, I've had my clues posted on both<br/>
&gt; &gt; LBNA and AQ for several years, and over the past few months, I've<br/>
&gt; &gt; started to find that cumbersome.  <br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; The real question for me is not "why did I pull my clues," but "why<br/>
&gt; &gt; did I have them double-posted in the first place?"  It's because I <br/>
&gt; was<br/>
&gt; &gt; just so excited about new things.  I sometimes have a problem with<br/>
&gt; &gt; "ooh...shiny."  <br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; So why leave them on LBNA, instead of AQ?  I'm becoming a Luddite,<br/>
&gt; &gt; starting to shun the shiny, and I prefer the simplicity of LBNA. <br/>
&gt; &gt; Atlas Quest is fast on the way to becoming an internet portal, it<br/>
&gt; &gt; seems, and I *personally* don't like that right now.  To each his <br/>
&gt; own,<br/>
&gt; &gt; and to me LBNA!<br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; Thanks for asking.<br/>
