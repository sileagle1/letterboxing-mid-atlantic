Thanks for bringing this to the board. At first I was going to email <br/>
you offline to thank you for your efforts and see what I could do. <br/>
But decided to do it publicly, because these guys/gals need to know <br/>
we care.  <br/>
<br/>
My Dad was stationed in `Nam. Mom was home with seven young ones <br/>
under the age of 10. She learned not to let people know that Dad was <br/>
in `Nam, because it was not a popular war. She relied on the other <br/>
wives and her dear sister who came to live in California while Dad <br/>
was overseas (rest of family was in Pennsylvania). She has many <br/>
stories of tough times from those years. We made it through and Dad <br/>
made it home. Many were not as lucky or had a tough time adjusting <br/>
when they returned.<br/>
<br/>
These men/women were not appreciated for doing their job. They didn't <br/>
necessarily want to do it (my dad was drafted into the military), but <br/>
it put food on the table and paid most bills and it was their job <br/>
that they did for their Country.<br/>
<br/>
To this day my Dad always greets anyone with a `Nam shirt, hat, logo, <br/>
etc with a "Welcome Home Soldier" It always brings tears to Mom's <br/>
eyes.<br/>
<br/>
Dad said if they could do what they were supposed to do; the war <br/>
would have not lasted as long! D*** Politicians!<br/>
<br/>
I have had my oldest Niece and Niece's Husband in the current <br/>
conflict. They fortunately made it home safely. <br/>
<br/>
Please support these guys/gals no matter what your position is in <br/>
politics. <br/>
<br/>
Every year my oldest Brother's gift to the family is a donation to a <br/>
Veteran's group that sends phone cards to soldiers overseas. It is <br/>
one of the most appreciated gifts I receive. I remember talking to <br/>
Dad and having to say "over" on the phone when you finished a <br/>
sentence because it was "patched" through to us (no cells back then). <br/>
<br/>
So send me your address (offline of course) and I'll send a <br/>
contribution.<br/>
<br/>
OK, off the soap box and back to lurking for me!<br/>

the letterbox s###, but for once it is not about me. Image that!)<br/>

OK, now I know why Joe isn't quite sure when I've finished a sentence.<br/>
He keeps looking at me like he's waiting for something. LOL<br/>

Our American Legion post sends packages overseas and my son's high<br/>
school has adopted a platoon. I just love a buy one, get one free sale<br/>
 or any sale on a target item for that matter.<br/>

</span></blockquote>I remember this with my husband not that many years ago (feeling <br/>
old)! God love ham radio operators--they would connect with the ship <br/>
and offer the sailors a chance to call home from sea for free <br/>
(otherwise satellite phone was something like $10 a minute).  The ham <br/>
radio operator would call the family member and I'd always forget to <br/>
say "over".<br/>
<br/>
New spouses and military members these days don't seem to fathom that <br/>
they are actually lucky to be able to speak with their spouses as <br/>
often as they can.  This can cause it's own problems (for instance <br/>
spouses at home who burden the military member with things they don't <br/>
need to know about- ie plumbing problems etc- instead of just taking <br/>
care of the problem)<br/>
<br/>
Kudos to you Natt for this! They need all the support they can get, <br/>
it just keeps getting harder everyday to hold their heads up when <br/>
some are on their third or fourth tour!<br/>
<br/>
I sponsor a co-worker's reserve unit until they return in May and we <br/>
support his wife here at home. Another soldier my division at work <br/>
sponsored and wrote to was killed in November by a sniper attack.  We <br/>
received his last letter to us a few weeks ago. Somber day, that...</div>
