As far as I know this is the first meet in WV.  It is near Charleston, <br/>
WV.  It is going to be Groundhog themed, and we are even having a vote <br/>
on whether French Creek Freddie (the WV groundhog) will or will not <br/>
see his shadow -- the voting is being conducted through postal <br/>
letterbox.<br/>
<br/>
So far we don't have many signed up to come.  I know I will enjoy <br/>
meeting with the ones who do, but it would be nice to see a few more.  <br/>
There doesn't seem to be much activity in WV, and I was hoping this <br/>
could get things jump-started.<br/>
