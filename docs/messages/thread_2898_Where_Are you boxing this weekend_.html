The family went out to find the last of Rick_in_Boca's mysteries that <br/>
we had not yet found - "Old Mushrooms".  We were first finder - <br/>
after 2 tries.  We went out later in the day and drove up to Cahilly's<br/>

&gt;  &gt; &gt; &gt; I have to work this weekend (thought it would be pushing it <br/>
to <br/>
&gt;  &gt; ask <br/>
&gt;  &gt; &gt; for 3 Saturdays off in a row!) but yesterday Cyclonic &amp; I got <br/>
out <br/>
&gt;  &gt; to <br/>
&gt;  &gt; &gt; find Psychiker &amp; Syner's 4 new mystery boxes, the Haunted Inn <br/>
&gt;  &gt; series &amp; <br/>
&gt;  &gt; &gt; A Learning Adventure. Lots of fun even though I think it was <br/>
as <br/>
&gt;  &gt; COLD <br/>
&gt;  &gt; &gt; as I've ever boxed in! <br/>
&gt;  &gt; &gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt;  &gt; &gt; &gt; So let's hear it--where've you been recently, and is anybody <br/>
&gt;  &gt; going <br/>
&gt;  &gt; &gt; out of doors this weekend?<br/>

Ring of Fire is awesome. Ball and Chain is my personal fave, but Ring <br/>
of Fire is an extremely close second.<br/>

We had 2,672 Bears and cleared $520,000 for Special Olympics Delaware <br/>
last year, so we'll probably raise something over $600,000 this <br/>
weekend.<br/>
<br/>
There's still time to help Special Olympics and of course I have a <br/>
stamp for anyone who does - email me if you're interested.<br/>
<br/>
We're heading down on Friday and will be looking for some DE/MD boxes <br/>
en route.  Again, some of those boxes that are better in the winter.</div>
