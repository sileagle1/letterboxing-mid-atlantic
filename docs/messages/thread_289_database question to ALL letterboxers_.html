<br/>
i am curious how many boxers use the computer to track their PFX <br/>
counts. besides the paper log book you carry into the field do you <br/>
also generate a digital record as well?<br/>
<br/>
i know some of you used MS Excel and others may use a database to <br/>
keep track. <br/>
<br/>
i am trying to find out if there is any interest within the group (or <br/>
individuals) to beta test a database program i am writing solely for <br/>
letterboxing. the platform will be written using Microsoft Access and <br/>
Visual Basic. you will need to have MSAccess installed on your PC (if <br/>
you are using MS Office this is included in the software package). <br/>
<br/>
what types of information would be useful to you? of course a PFX <br/>
count and percent successful rate. what about events? personally i've <br/>
never been to one, however, there has been a cry from other boxers <br/>
who use my Excel spreadsheet for such a feature. what about a sort <br/>
feature where you can sort by state or placer?<br/>
<br/>
in regards to Exchanges, since most of those are collected at events, <br/>
should those be tracked on a separate table from the PF count? where <br/>
the event is listed and every letterboxer you exchanged stamps with <br/>
would be grouped within that event. hmmm.<br/>
<br/>
Hitchhikers need to be counted, should they reside on a separate <br/>
table as well? obviously they will automatically be placed in your P <br/>
or F column regardless of which table they reside within the database.<br/>
<br/>
generating a print report my prove handy but would have to be <br/>
developed later. gee, so many questions... of course, any and all <br/>
suggestions are welcome.<br/>
<br/>

</span></blockquote>I just keep count in my book.<br/>
My other low-tech procedure is to print clues, write a numer in the <br/>
corner, and then put a sticky-dot with the same number on the <br/>
location of the box on a state map.<br/>
What I DO do on a spreadsheet is keep track of the condition of my <br/>
placed boxes. I enter each checkup by us, or found safe report by a <br/>
finder, with the date. When I sort by dates, I can see which box <br/>
needs attention first.<br/>
When I'm finished boxing for the day, I want to be finished, and not <br/>
have a computer task ahead of me.<br/>
