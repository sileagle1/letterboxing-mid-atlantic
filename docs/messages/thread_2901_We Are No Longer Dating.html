                    <div id="ygrps-yiv-110507613">Well, as many of you know, I started dating Becky back in September.  <br/>
She had been pretty much chasing me all summer long.  I knew what was <br/>
happening, but I excused it away.  I would say to myself, "Oh, she lives <br/>
too far away," using that as an excuse to not date her.  Well, that <br/>
worked real well, huh?<br/>
<br/>
Well, we have been hitting it off pretty well.  OK, more then pretty <br/>
well.  She is a fantastic woman, just amazing to be with.  She is smart, <br/>
funny, silly and just fun.  She is also astonishingly pretty, with these <br/>
beautiful golden brown eyes, little button nose and a smile that lights <br/>
up the room.  I find I cannot help but hold her hand when I am with her, <br/>
to hug and kiss her and keep her warm at night.<br/>
<br/>
Becky brings joy to my heart and happiness to my life.  I want to be <br/>
with her forever.<br/>
<br/>
That is why I asked her to marry me.<br/>
<br/>
I did not expect to ask.  It just kind of came up, popped out of my <br/>
mouth.  I had been thinking about it.  Thinking that if things kept <br/>
going well, maybe in the summer I would go find a ring and ask.  I guess <br/>
my heart is stronger then my mind at times, and it happened.<br/>
<br/>
"I want to be with you forever," she said to me on the morning of her <br/>
birthday.  I had made her breakfast, she asked that I would and I was <br/>
more then happy to do so.<br/>
<br/>
"Me too.  I want to be that old couple you see in the park, walking down <br/>
the path, still holding hands after all those years," I replied.<br/>
<br/>
"Me too."<br/>
<br/>
"Then would you marry me?" the words crossed my lips before I knew what <br/>
had just happened.<br/>
<br/>
"Yes!"<br/>
<br/>
I sought confirmation, "Really, you would marry me?"<br/>
<br/>
"Absolutely!"<br/>
<br/>
I was overjoyed.  Never, in a millions years had I expected to be <br/>
getting married.  And not only that, but I am wedding the most wonderful <br/>
woman imaginable.  I get butterflies in my stomach just thinking about <br/>
it.  Becky and I will be together forever.  I will take care of her, <br/>
grow old together with her, love her and cherish her for all my life.  <br/>
It is daunting to think about, but I can't imagine a challenge that <br/>
would not be more rewarding and bring more pleasure.<br/>

&gt; &gt; well.  She is a fantastic woman, just amazing to be<br/>
&gt; &gt; with.  She is smart, <br/>
&gt; &gt; funny, silly and just fun.  She is also<br/>
&gt; &gt; astonishingly pretty, with these <br/>
&gt; &gt; beautiful golden brown eyes, little button nose and<br/>
&gt; &gt; a smile that lights <br/>
&gt; &gt; up the room.  I find I cannot help but hold her hand<br/>
&gt; &gt; when I am with her, <br/>
&gt; &gt; to hug and kiss her and keep her warm at night.<br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; Becky brings joy to my heart and happiness to my<br/>
&gt; &gt; life.  I want to be <br/>
&gt; &gt; with her forever.<br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; That is why I asked her to marry me.<br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; I did not expect to ask.  It just kind of came up,<br/>
&gt; &gt; popped out of my <br/>
&gt; &gt; mouth.  I had been thinking about it.  Thinking that<br/>
&gt; &gt; if things kept <br/>
&gt; &gt; going well, maybe in the summer I would go find a<br/>
&gt; &gt; ring and ask.  I guess <br/>
&gt; &gt; my heart is stronger then my mind at times, and it<br/>
&gt; &gt; happened.<br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; "I want to be with you forever," she said to me on<br/>
&gt; &gt; the morning of her <br/>
&gt; &gt; birthday.  I had made her breakfast, she asked that<br/>
&gt; &gt; I would and I was <br/>
&gt; &gt; more then happy to do so.<br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; "Me too.  I want to be that old couple you see in<br/>
&gt; &gt; the park, walking down <br/>
&gt; &gt; the path, still holding hands after all those<br/>
&gt; &gt; years," I replied.<br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; "Me too."<br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; "Then would you marry me?" the words crossed my lips<br/>
&gt; &gt; before I knew what <br/>
&gt; &gt; had just happened.<br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; "Yes!"<br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; I sought confirmation, "Really, you would marry me?"<br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; "Absolutely!"<br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; I was overjoyed.  Never, in a millions years had I<br/>
&gt; &gt; expected to be <br/>
&gt; &gt; getting married.  And not only that, but I am<br/>
&gt; &gt; wedding the most wonderful <br/>
&gt; &gt; woman imaginable.  I get butterflies in my stomach<br/>
&gt; &gt; just thinking about <br/>
&gt; &gt; it.  Becky and I will be together forever.  I will<br/>
&gt; &gt; take care of her, <br/>
&gt; &gt; grow old together with her, love her and cherish her<br/>
&gt; &gt; for all my life.  <br/>
&gt; &gt; It is daunting to think about, but I can't imagine a<br/>
&gt; &gt; challenge that <br/>
&gt; &gt; would not be more rewarding and bring more pleasure.<br/>

The new Frog Kisses box in Nottingham is excellent and tells the <br/>
story letterbox-style.  I'd recommend trek poles for anyone trying <br/>
before until the southern Chester Co ice melts, but the hike takes <br/>
you to a great place.<br/>

&gt; Well, as many of you know, I started dating Becky back in September.  <br/>
&gt; She had been pretty much chasing me all summer long.  I knew what was <br/>
&gt; happening, but I excused it away.  I would say to myself, "Oh, she<br/>
lives <br/>
&gt; too far away," using that as an excuse to not date her.  Well, that <br/>
&gt; worked real well, huh?<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Well, we have been hitting it off pretty well.  OK, more then pretty <br/>
&gt; well.  She is a fantastic woman, just amazing to be with.  She is<br/>
smart, <br/>
&gt; funny, silly and just fun.  She is also astonishingly pretty, with<br/>
these <br/>
&gt; beautiful golden brown eyes, little button nose and a smile that lights <br/>
&gt; up the room.  I find I cannot help but hold her hand when I am with<br/>
her, <br/>
&gt; to hug and kiss her and keep her warm at night.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Becky brings joy to my heart and happiness to my life.  I want to be <br/>
&gt; with her forever.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; That is why I asked her to marry me.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I did not expect to ask.  It just kind of came up, popped out of my <br/>
&gt; mouth.  I had been thinking about it.  Thinking that if things kept <br/>
&gt; going well, maybe in the summer I would go find a ring and ask.  I<br/>
guess <br/>
&gt; my heart is stronger then my mind at times, and it happened.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; "I want to be with you forever," she said to me on the morning of her <br/>
&gt; birthday.  I had made her breakfast, she asked that I would and I was <br/>
&gt; more then happy to do so.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; "Me too.  I want to be that old couple you see in the park, walking<br/>
down <br/>
&gt; the path, still holding hands after all those years," I replied.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; "Me too."<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; "Then would you marry me?" the words crossed my lips before I knew what <br/>
&gt; had just happened.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; "Yes!"<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I sought confirmation, "Really, you would marry me?"<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; "Absolutely!"<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I was overjoyed.  Never, in a millions years had I expected to be <br/>
&gt; getting married.  And not only that, but I am wedding the most<br/>
wonderful <br/>
&gt; woman imaginable.  I get butterflies in my stomach just thinking about <br/>
&gt; it.  Becky and I will be together forever.  I will take care of her, <br/>
&gt; grow old together with her, love her and cherish her for all my life.  <br/>
&gt; It is daunting to think about, but I can't imagine a challenge that <br/>
&gt; would not be more rewarding and bring more pleasure.<br/>

                    <div id="ygrps-yiv-1628085643">Thanks for all the kind words from everyone.  There were several people <br/>
that were very instrumental in helping us get together, Irene and Sheba <br/>
to be sure, and many others who have supported us through their love and <br/>
kind words.  It has been an amazing trip so far.<br/>
<br/>
I hope some of you get the chance to check out Frog Kisses.  The clues <br/>
are metaphoric for how we got together, and I proposed again and gave <br/>
the ring to Becky at the box.  Sheba helped me plant it, so many thanks <br/>
to my good friend and boxing buddy.<br/>
<br/>
We basically spent the day running about yesterday.  She had bell choir <br/>
at church, and then we had lunch with her folks where she told them.  We <br/>
went boxing with her best friend Karen, finding the Bunny Fruit Chews <br/>
(cute series by Paper Trail) and visited her cousins.<br/>
<br/>
I am sorry if I have been a bit out of it of late.  She drives me to <br/>
distraction (not a bad thing), and really have not been keeping up as I <br/>
should.<br/>
<br/>
There is no date yet, we expect a bit of a longer engagement as we work <br/>
out the logistics and figure out just what we want to do.<br/>
<br/>
We know that some times will be harder then others, but that we will <br/>
work through them as we do love each other.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks again everyone.<br/>
