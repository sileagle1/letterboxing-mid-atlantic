took my daughter out on our first letterboxing adventure &amp; we got <br/>
bitten by the bug.  Unfortunately, we ended up on a really muddy trail <br/>
(which is no fun with a 5 year old).  So, now I'm wondering, do I need <br/>
to wait out the winter?  It's a little hard since we just started.  <br/>
I'll try to be patient, though.  I'm just glad I found a way to get my <br/>
chickadee to go hiking with me (without complaining).  By the by, does <br/>
anyone know any trails/letterboxes in Southeastern Pennsylvania that <br/>
might not be so muddy.</div>

Of course, boxing French Creek usually precludes any mud.<br/>

But, anyways, welcome to the new folks.  Where in SE PA are you folks from?<br/>

&gt; Poison ivy can still get you and the vampire plants seem to endure<br/>
&gt; pretty well, but there are some boxes that we regard as winter-only<br/>

                    <div id="ygrps-yiv-868643162">as a mom of 2 boys - 4&amp;7, go whenever the weather is mild enough for <br/>
a hike.  Remember the hiking will warm you all up &amp; mittens &amp; hats <br/>
help too.  Last winter, I waited until the weather warmed up for some <br/>
local boxes that turned out to be wrapped in poison ivy &amp; then they <br/>
were muggled before this winter.  I also love that there are no <br/>
toys/germs being shared, so it's a great way to have a playdate when <br/>
your kid has that lingering cough - also a great way to introduce <br/>
lboxing to others (so you can explain the etiquette) - and the extra <br/>
kids help motivate each other to keep going (toward the next big tree <br/>
or the snack waiting in the car!)<br/>
<br/>
Ridley Creek is great to take kids (&amp; dogs), lots of choices, many <br/>
short hikes. chester springs has a couple in a great nature area <br/>
(check atlasquest).  <br/>
<br/>
As for the mud, after watching our kids &amp; the keystone khans' walk <br/>
fully clothed into french creek's lake @ the alienteering gather this <br/>
summer, all I can say is, "it's good to be a kid."  Pack boots &amp; <br/>
sometimes a change of clothes &amp; change b4 you get back in the <br/>
car.  :)  <br/>
