</span></blockquote>Hi Moonowl,<br/>
<br/>
First, I was, well, distracted and did not get the chance to welcome you <br/>
to the group.  So, welcome!<br/>
<br/>
I feel bad that several of us, including myself, have been very <br/>
neglectful when it comes to planting in the city.  There are some <br/>
fantastic locations, and I hope to do my part in rectifying that <br/>
oversight in the coming months.<br/>
<br/>
I believe the Eastern State Pen box is long, long gone.<br/>
<br/>
There were some boxes planting in Philly last year that may still be <br/>
there.  Search this list for the topics Chaos at the Zoo and Freedom <br/>
Trail for the clues to these boxes.<br/>
<br/>
I believe the boxes in Manayunk, as well as those in the Wissahichon are <br/>
still there as well.<br/>
<br/>
When do you plan on heading out, perhaps we can get an exchange.<br/>

I replaced the Manyunk stamp some time ago.<br/>
But it may be missing again already.<br/>
I seem to recall a report of possible MIA.<br/>
If anyone can confirm it is there (or not) I'd appreciate the help.<br/>
I'll carve again if necessary.<br/>
Thanks.<br/>

&gt; The Manayunk one was missing its stamp as of a few years ago. <br/>
Raindeer<br/>
&gt; was supposed to recarve one but I'm not sure if he ever did...?<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; My own Wiss boxes are poorly maintained and might not be there<br/>
&gt; anymore. There are other boxes there that I've found, however. <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I'm planning a number of Philly boxes in the near future...just <br/>
still<br/>
&gt; scouting a location for the piece de resistance :)<br/>

&gt; &gt; Hey Cyclonic, thanks for the welcome!<br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; I feel bad that several of us, including myself, have been very <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; neglectful when it comes to planting in the city.  There are <br/>
some <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; fantastic locations, and I hope to do my part in rectifying <br/>
that <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; oversight in the coming months.<br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; I plan to plant a few before the spring too- I'm scouting three <br/>
west<br/>
&gt; &gt; Philly/university city locations now. I can tell you all- plan a <br/>
trip<br/>
&gt; &gt; to the Woodlands (40th and Woodland Ave, Green Line trolley stop @<br/>
&gt; &gt; 40th street) soon!<br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; I believe the Eastern State Pen box is long, long gone.<br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; Oh well, thanks for letting me know.<br/>
&gt; &gt;  <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; There were some boxes planting in Philly last year that may <br/>
still be <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; there.  Search this list for the topics Chaos at the Zoo and <br/>
Freedom <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; Trail for the clues to these boxes.<br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; Thanks! I didn't know about these. I haven't been to the Zoo in <br/>
quite<br/>
&gt; &gt; some time anyway. <br/>
&gt; &gt; (I have to admit just reading Freedom #3 I'm a bit stumped <br/>
already)<br/>

Anyway, I replaced Eastern State Penitentary a couple of years ago <br/>
using velcro and cammo tape and it disappeared within a week. There are <br/>
just too many kids right there for a box of any size to survive. And <br/>
now I can't maintain MartianMaggot boxes anyway.<br/>
