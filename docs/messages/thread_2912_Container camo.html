Now for the boxes: I have some screw top pill bottles that are the<br/>

see if they are really watertight.<br/>

Any good ideas on how to 'camo' them? wrapping them in dark duct tape?<br/>

                    <div id="ygrps-yiv-430548876">Depends on where it will be.  Apparently weathered silver duct tape takes on the look of concrete.  I'm a big fan of textured finish plastic spray paint (Rustoleum), but not everyone goes for it.  Tape can attract moisture. Some people just use Sharpies.  Try something and see how it works.<br/><br/><b><i>lunastrixae &lt;lunastrixae@...&gt;</i></b> wrote:  <blockquote><span title="qreply"> <blockquote class="ygrps-yiv-430548876replbq" style="PADDING-LEFT:5px;MARGIN-LEFT:5px;BORDER-LEFT:#1010ff 2px solid;"> <div id="ygrps-yiv-430548876ygrp-text"> <div>Holy cripes on a cracker, did I find a good box location on my<br/>lunchtime walk today!!!<br/><br/>Now for the boxes: I have some screw top pill bottles that are the<br/>right size.

In the woods we use a lot of the camo duct tape -- the old rolls that<br/>
can be torn not the new ones that are so plastic they don't even stick<br/>
to themselves.  <br/>
<br/>
An urban box would probably need to blend in with something other than<br/>
 leaves and most paint on plastic doesn't last.  The Fusion spray for<br/>
plastic probably would do better.<br/>
<br/>
Use of plastic bags should be limited to the inside and not used as an<br/>
exterior covering.<br/>
<br/>
Good luck and let us know what you decide.  Maybe it will be the new<br/>
idea of the year!<br/>
