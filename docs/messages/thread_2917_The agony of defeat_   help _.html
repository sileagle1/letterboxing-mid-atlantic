I have unsuccessfully tried several times to 'contact the placer'. <br/>
Total speculation on my part: but I visualize /the mobot/ as a student<br/>
who planted this box while attending &amp; living locally and then moving<br/>
on, changing email addresses, obtaining gainful employment, and<br/>
kicking/forgetting letterboxing...<br/>
<br/>
C'est la vie.  As much as it pains me I have LBNA-marked this box to<br/>
'ignore'.  Onward to other Mysteries!<br/>

I started letterboxing in the summer of 2002 and looking at posts <br/>
from then is a major flashback. A few of us are still around (hi, <br/>
Scarab!). :)<br/>

Although it really eats away at me, wondering what the Mobots had in <br/>
mind with their cryptic references. I did find two of their boxes a few <br/>
years back, "McKeldin Library" and "Testudo's Hideout." I tried for a <br/>
third, "The Stinkeye," and couldn't come up with it. That one involved <br/>
reaching into the hiding place past broken beer bottles and other trash <br/>
of the "icky" sort. Given the busy urban location, it has to be long <br/>
gone.  <br/>
<br/>
I really liked the Mobots' clue style and wish they were still around.<br/>
Their boxes are a nice piece of letterboxing history.<br/>
<br/>
Speaking of which, I checked on the "HLRG" restoration of Pencil Pusher <br/>
you and WF and I did and it still has no finders!<br/>

makes me want to go out there with my heavy gloves and a stick and poke <br/>
around in there again to see if that rock they mention still exists. I <br/>
know I did not have a rock in mind at the time I looked. Maybe I could <br/>
take a trash bag with me as "cover" and rid the place of some of the <br/>
broken glass and icky stuff.....<br/>
<br/>
Interesting too that La Chola found Hidden Harvest! That could be a big <br/>
help to Midnight Boxer, as they've been in contact with La Chola <br/>
recently, doing a restoration of several of her Arborology boxes. Hmmm, <br/>
all may not be lost!<br/>
