	There's a possibility that I may end up taking a weekend trip to<br/>
Delaware, and if so it will probably be almost entirely devoted to boxing,<br/>
adding on to that fierce F8.  Now you KNOW I'm hooked!  I assume that<br/>
Delaware is included within the scope of the Mid-Atlantic group, but if not,<br/>
please do correct me so I can direct this to the proper list.  Anyway, does<br/>
anybody from there or who has been there recently know the status of the<br/>
various boxes?  Any that I should make a particular effort to see, or not<br/>
try?  (I don't want to go searching for something that I know is MIA.)<br/>

wearing a baseball hat with duct tape on the back will frustrate them <br/>
