From what I understand &amp; the boxers I have met, the planters are <br/>
willing to help, if you are willing to ask (nicely) and they know <br/>
you have already put some time &amp; effort solving.<br/>

remind you of that. How mean you are.<br/>
<br/>
I think this situation is only problematic for me when I assume the <br/>
planter is long gone because they don't reply to emails or maintain <br/>
their boxes or clues.<br/>
<br/>
I have sometimes given someone a hint to adjust for incorrect clues, <br/>
like when the clues say the box is in a standing tree and I know the <br/>
tree has fallen. I think these kinds of hints aren't really kosher, but <br/>
if I like you, I might help out.<br/>
<br/>
There is a train of thought that says the finder should keep in mind <br/>
the date that the box was planted when seeking a box, and that things <br/>
change over time, adding to the mystery. So an unedited set of clues <br/>
increase the box's difficulty over time as the waypoints get vandalized <br/>
and lost. How do you feel about hints on those boxes?<br/>

<br/>
I'm one who doesn't feel it's best to ask questions publically.  Try <br/>
the placer and, if no luck there, perhaps your circle of friends.  If <br/>
I were the owner of a particularily hard clue, I'd like discussion to <br/>
remain off list. (not that that would *ever* happen as I apparently <br/>
lack the imagination to write hard clues, ahem).<br/>
<br/>
Now, since you brought Randy into the equation--I just may be the <br/>
only person alive who, when given the golden ticket bought with a <br/>
certain beer whose brand escapes me at the moment, was given the <br/>
opportunity to ask Randy for one clue that he said he'd freely give <br/>
and drew a complete and absolute blank!<br/>
<br/>
Which box to ask about????<br/>
<br/>
Eastern Shore Treasure Map??<br/>
<br/>
Mapsurfer Quatrains?<br/>
<br/>
The Bride's Togs??<br/>
<br/>
Priceless??<br/>
<br/>
So many questions ran through my head that I couldn't just pinpoint <br/>
it to one.  And so I gave up the one chance I had to an ultimate clue <br/>
to a Mapsurfer box.<br/>
<br/>
Ack!!<br/>

report and a promise to check on the box, which I think is fair - <br/>
but then months go by and the notes are still on the clue.  <br/>
<br/>
We've had new boxers correctly report missing boxes and we've had <br/>
veteran boxers flat-out miss boxes, so we take that into account <br/>
even as we take into account the experience level of the person <br/>
making the MIA report.<br/>
<br/>
There's a box in DE that we think was a project box that is no <br/>
longer there and the placer has not yet responded.  It's still not <br/>
for us to call it missing but if the box comes up for discussion <br/>
then I will probably tell about our experience (nasty, nasty folks <br/>
there, too).<br/>

&gt; hiding spots and subsequent success.  Also, I think you can get to <br/>
know the<br/>
&gt; planters in your area and develop a feel for their clues and <br/>
favorite hiding<br/>
&gt; spots.  My friend Flying Dragon planted a bunch of boxes in secret <br/>
(his wife<br/>
&gt; didn't know he'd come over to the dark side, er, um, started <br/>
letterboxing)<br/>
&gt; and as I searched for them with his wife, she kept telling me that <br/>
it was a<br/>
&gt; pity FD didn't box, because the placement of the boxes reminded <br/>
her so much<br/>
&gt; of him.  I had the hardest time keeping that secret!<br/>

the owner<br/>

&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; Syner and I have found box bits and reported that to the placer, <br/>
but<br/>
&gt; &gt; even with the evidence of a muggled box in hand, it wasn't for <br/>
us to<br/>

&gt; &gt; If an MIA report suggests that the attempt was off then the <br/>
placer<br/>
&gt; &gt; should probably say so, but otherwise, the placer might take the<br/>

I've<br/>

                    <div id="ygrps-yiv-1813107578">For me it all boils down to whether the planter is active or not. My <br/>
own practice is that I never ask about boxes where I know the planter <br/>
is currently active. So for example, I would never ask Natty about <br/>
his boxes, nor ask anyone else about them in the online boards.<br/>
<br/>
I do feel differently about older boxes with checkered histories <br/>
where the planters are no longer active. So, for example in the last <br/>
few days here there was a small discussion about the Mobots and the <br/>
Hidden Harvest box. That, I feel, is kosher, especially since for <br/>
those of us local to this box, we have some idea of the situation. In <br/>
addition, MB, who brought up the topic, is a very seasoned and <br/>
dedicated finder in these parts who has rendered numerous first aid <br/>
and other kindnesses to boxes for several years. A good boxer, and <br/>
one who has solved many a mystery box to boot. I know that if MB is <br/>
moved to ask about a box, there must be a real reason for it.<br/>
<br/>
I also think there are a few circumstances when it is OK to <br/>
correspond offline with folks who post an online question about a box <br/>
I've previously found---again, if the placer is no longer active. One <br/>
is if the box is not only missing, with clues still online, but also <br/>
planted in a very dangerous place. There is one box in our area like <br/>
this, and whenever I see online that someone is searching for it, I <br/>
email them offline and mention that it is not only missing, but <br/>
originally had been planted in a dangerously decrepit area known for <br/>
drug dealing.<br/>
<br/>
The other time I correspond offline is for an orphaned box I have <br/>
found that is still active but long ago had been moved to a different <br/>
location. The clues were never updated, the planter is long gone, and <br/>
boxers keep looking in the original place when the poor box is just a <br/>
little further down the trail.<br/>
<br/>
As the saying goes, your mileage may vary. But this is what I've come <br/>
up with for myseslf.</div>

You raise an interesting safety point.  I don't normally post online my <br/>
intentions re: searching for boxes (tend to be too spontaneous).  I <br/>
feel reasonably comfortable abt safety in the Phila metro area - having <br/>
lived in Philly &amp; the burbs/ country hereabouts my whole life - but <br/>
hadn't given much thought to boxes outside SE PA.  I don't box w/o my <br/>
husband (for safety reasons) &amp; feel collectively savvy enough to <br/>
say "this place doesn't feel right," but wonder if this place you refer <br/>
to is that obvious?<br/>

                    <div id="ygrps-yiv-566394522">I recently witnessed an occurence where one boxer was asking a <br/>
planter for a clue to one of their mystery boxes.  It seemed obvious <br/>
to me that the planter did not want to offer any additional info.  <br/>
The boxer that was asking certainly seemed like a nice person and <br/>
well intentioned in their desire to seek the box...but it took a <br/>
couple of friendly exchanges back in forth before the boxer stopped <br/>
asking for additional hints.  <br/>
<br/>
I myself have asked for a hint on occassion.  I recently asked for a <br/>
hint to a box that I had searched for 2 times without luck.  It turns <br/>
out that after I described the details to the placer....and they went <br/>
and checked on it.....that the box was actually not there.  I could <br/>
have asked for info sooner....such as after the first attempt, but I <br/>
like putting forth the effort in looking for the box.  I also wanted <br/>
to be sure that I was indeed checking the right spot....as the clues <br/>
were pretty tough to figure out...and besides that...I really liked <br/>
the area where the box had been placed.  A great 3 mile hike - each <br/>
way.  <br/>
<br/>
I see nothing wrong with asking for some info from a placer.  Some <br/>
boxers will put forth alot of effort to find a box first...while <br/>
others will merely look at a clue and ask for help in solving it.  <br/>
Regardless of the circumstance, it is certainly the planter's choice <br/>
to decide whether they want to offer help and at what point that help <br/>
is deemed to be warranted.  If a boxer is not happy with the response <br/>
from the placer...then they should go look for another box.  I <br/>
myself, like many of you, have come across some boxers who don't <br/>
bother to respond to e-mails...and that's the way life is.<br/>
<br/>
I have found over 200 boxes and still have yet to plant one.  I have <br/>
several locations all mapped out and the clues are ready to go...but <br/>
as of yet...I still do not like my carvings.  So the boxes will wait <br/>
for now....but not for too much longer.  And will I offer hints to my <br/>
boxes??  It depends.  If the effort was there and I am presented with <br/>
sufficient info that shows you were nearby...I may throw a hint your <br/>
way.  But then again.........maybe not.  LOL.     -John</div>
