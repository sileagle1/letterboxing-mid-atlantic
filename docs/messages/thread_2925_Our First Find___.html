<br/>
We had a nice weekend here in Maryland so I took my to kids 11 and 9 <br/>
out boxing.  They really didn't want to go at first but after getting <br/>
them excited about buying journals and stamps, and then finding the <br/>
first box (When Pigs Fly) right away they both said "hey this is pretty <br/>
fun"!  So we then attempted a site off of letterboxing.org (What Lies <br/>
Beneath) but couldn't find it.  The clues seemed a little unclear, plus <br/>
we had a lot of rain the previous few days and I think some of the area <br/>
was under water!  But we all had fun exploring a trail we had never <br/>
been to before.  So.... I am defintely bitten.  <br/>
Look forward to seeing you all out there!<br/>
