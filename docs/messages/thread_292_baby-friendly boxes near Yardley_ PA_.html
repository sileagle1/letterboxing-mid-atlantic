<br/>
A good friend of mine in Yardley, PA (Bucks County) would like to look<br/>
for her first boxes. She'll be taking her two month old baby along,<br/>
though, so that knocks out long or difficult hikes or very long drives<br/>
for now. Since I'm way up here in NY, I can't offer her personal<br/>
recommendations on good boxes to start out with or ones to avoid. Any<br/>
suggestions?<br/>
<br/>
Thanks so much!<br/>

<div>Soon, very soon, I will have 7-8 boxes planted in Tamenend Park off of Second Street Pike in Southampton, PA. Not too awfully far from Yardely, maybe 30-45 minutes depending on how you go. They are store bought stamps and the series is meant to be easy for younger kids who can't handle some of the longer hikes but all are welcome to hunt them. I have permission, I am just waiting for the park director to give me the go ahead to plant. Will post when it is done. <br/><br/><b><i>Angele McQuade &lt;angemcquade@...&gt;</i></b> wrote:</div>

<div><font face="Arial" family="SANSSERIF" size="2">***************************************************<br/>I have planted several boxes near Yardley that would be very baby friendly.  The easiest would be the Canal Bridge box (<a href="http://www.penncoasters.com/letterboxing/canal%20bridge.htm" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.penncoasters.com/letterboxing/canal%20bridge.htm</a>).  The box is right on the trail, and is very stoller accessible, even wheelchair accessible with a little help.</font></div><font face="Arial" family="SANSSERIF" size="2"></font></div>
<div><font face="Arial" family="SANSSERIF" size="2"></font> </div>
<div><font face="Arial" family="SANSSERIF" size="2">The Bowmans Hill Tower box (<a href="http://www.penncoasters.com/letterboxing/bowmans%20hill%20tower.htm" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.penncoasters.com/letterboxing/bowmans%20hill%20tower.htm</a>) is just slightly off trail, as in less then a 30 second step off the trail to get it.</font></div>
<div><font face="Arial" family="SANSSERIF" size="2"></font> </div>
<div><font face="Arial" family="SANSSERIF" size="2">Finally, Scudder Falls Bridge (http://www.penncoasters.com/letterboxing/scudder%20falls%20bridge.htm) is in the rest area at Yardley, and is pretty easy to get to, also just off trail.</font></div>
<div><font face="Arial" family="SANSSERIF" size="2"></font> </div>
<div><font face="Arial" family="SANSSERIF" size="2">As I recall, Winahawcawchunck and Battle of Trenton, both close by, are also easy and just off the trails.</font></div>
