Urban Oasis<br/>
There is an urban oasis at the University Franklin made. Find a walk<br/>
with the name of the first US Secretary of the Treasury. Enter near<br/>
the building dedicated to the scientist who named the first almost<br/>
complete dinosaur skeleton.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
#1: <br/>
<br/>
As you respect this fragile place, <br/>
look to your right and go talk to the hand.<br/>
It doesn't look like anyone has used that door in years, but<br/>
no one has used that cast iron downspout to the right in even longer.<br/>
Only a sad, rusty square box remains, filled with old slate roof tiles.<br/>
(slate can have sharp edges, be careful)<br/>
<br/>
#2:<br/>
<br/>
Walk to the Oasis and say hello to the fish!<br/>
Rest a minute, Patricia won't mind.<br/>
There is another seat to the left if you prefer.<br/>
Is that really a path just beyond? <br/>
It is if you have to squeeze past a big rock.<br/>
Up one step, two, stop right there.<br/>
All alone, a smaller rock sits between the shrubs to the right.<br/>
Nice ivy covered space along the side for a small friend to hide.<br/>
<br/>
#3 <br/>
Past the great big rock, keep going up <br/>
A seat with a view waits.  (Maybe you should bide your time if it's<br/>
occupied.)<br/>
All clear? <br/>
Find the tree from Norway.<br/>
The living tree grows around a reddish rock.<br/>
Whoops! Did you drop your keys again?<br/>
Reach to the far side of the tree and find another ivy-covered place<br/>
to hide.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Urban microboxes. Please bring stamp pad and pen.<br/>
<br/>
The Oasis is very busy at lunchtime on the weekdays. You may not want<br/>
to visit then, or choose a day when the weather isn't perfect for<br/>
picnics. If you can't retrieve the boxes without being seen, visit<br/>
another time. Please use extreme care. Drop your keys, stamp up away<br/>
from the spot, etc.</div>

The stamps are lovely -- much, much better than the only two I've carved <br/>
so far! -- and the clues were just mysterious enough to be interesting. <br/>
The hiding places are excellent.<br/>
<br/>
We wound up taking all three boxes back to the car to stamp in, though, <br/>
because I felt so exposed doing it on campus. We didn't pass too <br/>
terribly many people on the ground, but I felt as if there were someone <br/>
watching us from every window.<br/>

The Oasis is a pretty busy place, but on the upside staff are used to<br/>
seeing people lingering around there. I tested hanging out at Box #1<br/>
and #3 and pretending I was looking to see if it would rise any<br/>
suspicion. I think it will help once the leaves come out again, too. <br/>
<br/>
I figure if boxes at the Zoo have a chance for a short time, maybe<br/>
these will too. <br/>

&gt; We decided to risk pneumonia and go out this morning, and it was great. <br/>
&gt; The stamps are lovely -- much, much better than the only two I've<br/>
carved <br/>
&gt; so far! -- and the clues were just mysterious enough to be interesting. <br/>
&gt; The hiding places are excellent.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; We wound up taking all three boxes back to the car to stamp in, though, <br/>

Excellent clues and stamps.. definitely a must for anyone who wants a<br/>
good box series on a cold day. Short walk, great reward :)<br/>
<br/>
Luckily no one was in the oasis but us, but I'm sure it will be really<br/>
busy there once it warms up!<br/>
