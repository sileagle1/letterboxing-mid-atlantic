<br/>
is probably the best, most concise site for e new oxer to learn most <br/>
of the lingo and "how to's" of the hobby.  He wrote it when he lived <br/>
here in the LBMA zone, so we feel a little bit of pride by <br/>
association.<br/>
<br/>
www.atlaquest.com also has a glossary that can be accessed by the <br/>
toolbar (on the left hand side).  In some ways they overlap, in some <br/>
ways they do not.  It is also a good place for a new boxer to <br/>
generally learn.<br/>
