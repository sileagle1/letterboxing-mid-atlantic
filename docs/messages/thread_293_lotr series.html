Carvin Carmen informs me we still have enough for 3 more boxes and I went and bought 2 more sheets tonight. It's 12 feet by 54 inches for $9.99 in with the camo-hunting stuff (hats, clothes, backpacks). We just cut out a square about the size of a bandana (insert mystery movie reference here: "Settle down Tolfield, your messin' up my good luck bandana!" 5 points to whomever guess it) and wrap the boxes and secure with rubber bands. Pretty low tech but so far so good. When I decided to move our "Steal Your Face" box, which we had poorly planted and it turned into "Drown Your face" whenever it rained, I just threw out the old peice, which was still useable but gross and wrapped it in a new one 'cause the stuff is so cheap. Anyway, I forget who stated on the big list that they use this but we sure appreciate the tip. Just passin' it on...</div>
