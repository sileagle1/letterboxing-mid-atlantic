                    <div id="ygrps-yiv-1527959726">Back last year when I started carving my own stamps, I ordered the <br/>
sampler pack from Stampeaz.  I started using the white PZKut <br/>
grade 'B' and never looked back.  I tried the orange PZKut once or <br/>
twice, but didn't like it too much.<br/>
<br/>
The point of all this is that I have several chunks of carving media <br/>
that I will most likely never use, and am willing to let them go for <br/>
the price of postage.  E-mail me privately if you're interested.  <br/>
First come-first served.  I suppose I could also put it in a newly <br/>
planted box as a first-finder prize....<br/>
<br/>
Here's what I've got:<br/>
<br/>
A 4" X 6" X 3/4" block of Staedtler Mastercarve (still in the <br/>
shrinkwrap)<br/>
<br/>
A 4" X 6" block of Speedball Speedy-Stamp (the 'pink stuff', also <br/>
still in the shrinkwrap)<br/>
<br/>
A 10" X 5" block of orange PZKut Grade 'A'(with a 3" X 3" chunk <br/>
missing)<br/>
<br/>
I'll also trade any of the preceding for usable pieces of white <br/>
PZKut 'B' you might want to part with.<br/>
