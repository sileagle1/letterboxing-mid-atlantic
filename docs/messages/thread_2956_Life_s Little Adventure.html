                    <div id="ygrps-yiv-930394585">"Life's Little Adventure",  A Letterboxing Story<br/>
<br/>
Today, WhisperFoot, Baby-Boo, and I found the "Life's Little<br/>
Adventure" letterbox alongside the Loch Raven Reservoir in<br/>
Cockeysville, Maryland.  Not a major accomplishment typically worth<br/>
writing about: the box itself was in good shape, it was an easy and<br/>
short hike, the logbook wasn't moldy, stamp was store bought, plenty<br/>
of boxers have stamped in, less than 15mins round trip from parking to<br/>
stamping and back on the road.  Quick, easy, standard fare - but the<br/>
name of the box and the entirety of the story might be interesting to<br/>
others infected with the Letterboxing parasite.<br/>
<br/>
So, today was actually our second attempt at finding this box.  Our<br/>
first attempt was Thanksgiving Day '06.  Thanksgiving Day, you ask? <br/>
Yes, we try to get outdoors to hike and box on every opportunity<br/>
including holidays.  The plan was to dash out grab a few boxes, dash<br/>
home, and join the family for Turkey-day dinner.  We had chosen a<br/>
couple of drive-by/short-hike boxes in Baltimore County Maryland<br/>
specifically because it was a nasty weather day (raining, low-40's; in<br/>
my opinion-probably the worst weather, period) and because WhisperFoot<br/>
had just given birth to Baby-Boo a couple of weeks earlier and was<br/>
nursing.  After a relatively short drive and finding another drive-by<br/>
box we arrived at Life's Little Adventure.  The rain hasn't let up and<br/>
had, in fact, intensified.  Upon arriving Baby-Boo woke-up and started<br/>
demanding lunch, as newborns do.  Putting on our multi-tasking hats<br/>
was a no-brainer; WhisperFoot &amp; Baby-Boo would stay behind nice and<br/>
dry in the car, take care of feeding while I would head out into the<br/>
downpour, find the box, stamp us in, and return.  Nothing<br/>
earthshattering with this plan except, as Robert Burns so aptly stated<br/>
"The best laid plans of mice and men often go awry."  <br/>
<br/>
So, I suited-up and headed off down the trail to find the box. <br/>
Whisperfoot and Baby-Boo stayed behind in the car, which is parked at<br/>
the bottom of a gully situated between several large hills overlooking<br/>
the Reservoir.  The trail heads uphill and the Box's clue states that<br/>
I should go "about 3/4 up the trail".  So I start heading uphill.  It<br/>
is fairly hard to describe how steep this hill is and/or how long the<br/>
trail is, but this is a substantial grade following an, obviously<br/>
rarely-used, fire-road into the hills around the Reservoir.  Being<br/>
that I follow directions rather literally, I look up the hill and<br/>
calculate that "3/4 up the trail" is 3/4 up the hill and it is going<br/>
to take me about 10-15mins strenuous hiking through several<br/>
switchbacks until I should start looking for the next part of the<br/>
clue-- which is a small side trail.  This is not really the<br/>
drive-by/short-hike that we had in mind, but I am already wet and I<br/>
have like 15-20 minutes to kill anyway as Baby-Boo is feeding.  So,<br/>
I'm in pretty good shape, I go for it.  I climb and climb and climb. <br/>
At every switchback I look uphill to calculate how much closer to 3/4<br/>
up the hill I am, and I do keep an eye out for the side trail -- clues<br/>
are often fubar'd and backwards, right?   Climb, climb, climb, and the<br/>
trail never ends, and no side-trail in sight.  10 minutes turns into<br/>
15, into 20; pass through switchback #3, 4, 5, hey, now I can see the<br/>
top of the hill and the houses that line the hilltop --they have a<br/>
really nice view!-- but this damn trail keeps on going.  I am now out<br/>
of breath, and i realize that I have another 20mins to get back to the<br/>
car and that I must have *missed* the side-trail (it is raining and I<br/>
am only human, right?).  So I turn around and head back down the hill<br/>
- keeping an eye out for that side trail.  Down, down, down through<br/>
all the switchbacks. No side trail.  Finally back to the parking lot<br/>
and the car.  Okay, I think, I must be blind and stupid, but its<br/>
raining and its a holiday so I will just email the planter and ask for<br/>
better clues. <br/>
<br/>
I get back to the car, totally soaked to the bone all the way through<br/>
my socks, where WhisperFoot gives me the "so this was a drive-by?"<br/>
look; Baby-Boo had finished feeding 20mins ago and is about to fall<br/>
back to sleep.  I explain what happened and recommend that we punt on<br/>
the rest of the day, go home, and just enjoy the rest of the holiday.<br/>
 WhisperFoot agrees and goes to start the car.  She turns the key and<br/>
gets the dreaded -click--click--click- of a dead car battery.  While I<br/>
was off hunting the box we had accidentally left the car lights on. <br/>
Oh shit- the ~45mins I was gone the freaking lights had been on and<br/>
drained the battery.  Now what, we are basically in the middle of<br/>
nowhere.  Okay.... We are AAA members in good standing, right?  We did<br/>
pay the membership last summer, right?  We will just call them up and<br/>
get jumpstart.  No big deal, happens all the time.  Okay, we dig out<br/>
the membership card and fire-up the cell phone.  Whats this?  No<br/>
signal?  wtf?  Oh, we are in a gully at the bottom of a reservoir. <br/>
But we are only 3miles from York Road, one of the busiest roads north<br/>
of Baltimore.  Doesn't matter, we are in the bottom of a gully and<br/>
physics don't lie.  There is no cell signal.  We are stuck.<br/>
<br/>
So honey, you have been sitting here for the last 45mins, how many<br/>
cars have gone by; can we flag down a passing motorist?  Whats that-<br/>
maybe 2-3 cars in 45mins?  Oh yeah, its Thanksgiving Day and we are<br/>
really off the beaten path... double-shit.  Okay, now what.  I guess I <br/>
have to hump it up the hill until there is enough signal to get<br/>
through to AAA.  So, off I go back up the hill.  At least I know the<br/>
hill as I *just* climbed it.  I will double-time it as best I can --<br/>
no more looking for side trails -- and be back shortly.  So back up<br/>
the hill I go.  I periodically check the phone to see if there is a<br/>
signal; 10mins, 15mins no signal yet... 20mins and finally i have<br/>
1-bar on the phone.  I stop and call AAA and get disconnected/dropped<br/>
as soon as the operator connects.  Look back down at the phone - it<br/>
has switched from digital to analog and then to no-signal.  Okay, got<br/>
to hike some more.  Get to the next switchback, check the phone and<br/>
now have 2-bars.  Okay, time to try again.  Call.  Get through... line<br/>
is a bit fuzzy but AAA answers.. Yes, Mr. Midnight Boxer let me pull<br/>
up your account, your membership looks to be in good standing, your<br/>
battery is dead?  Okay, lets get someone dispatched to help you out.  <br/>
Where are you located... click... silence... silence...  I look down<br/>
at the phone.  It is stone cold dead; powered off.  I try to power it <br/>
back on, nothing.  The battery is dead.  omg. wtf.  I didn't get a<br/>
chance to tell them where we are!  I am standing on the side of a hill<br/>
with a dead cell phone in my hand.  My newborn and (up to now, very<br/>
loving and tolerant wife) are at the bottom of this hill; and we are <br/>
stranded.  Now what do I do?   Can't do anything but hump back down<br/>
this (now f'ing) hill and pray that WhisperFoot brought her cellphone<br/>
AND has it charged ((she has a history of not (a) bringing it and not<br/>
(b) keeping it charged)).  <br/>
<br/>
Slipping and sliding, I get to the bottom of the hill.  Muddy; wet;<br/>
who really cares at this point.  Honey, you REALLY aren't going to<br/>
believe this.....please tell me you have your phone.  you DO?  ....is<br/>
it ...charged?   great (...too tired at this point to muster any real<br/>
enthusiasm, I know that I will have to climb that abominable hill<br/>
again).   "How much signal do you have?"  "None."   "Yeah, that is<br/>
about right...." and back up I go.  This time I am successful in<br/>
getting through to AAA and getting a service truck dispatched.  Before <br/>
hanging-up, the dispatcher tells me the estimated time it will take<br/>
the service truck:  2hrs.   2HRS!?, Oh, thats right, it's Thanksgiving<br/>
Day and *everyone* is off enjoying the holiday... back down the hill.<br/>
<br/>
To conclude this flashback, the AAA truck arrived 1.5hrs later and<br/>
what should have been a 15min drive-by-box became a 4-5hr detour into<br/>
a letterboxing-hell and a general Holiday nightmare.  We drove<br/>
straight home and did make Turkey-Day dinner with the family, but we<br/>
were not really in the holiday mood the rest of the night (not<br/>
terribly unexpected, right?).  As I recollect it, neither of us joined<br/>
into the usual internecine-intrafamily political debates (I suppose<br/>
the family chalked it up to our being overly-stressed new parents --<br/>
they had no idea of the 1st half our our day and the *fun* we had at<br/>
the reservoir).<br/>
<br/>
So, getting back to today:  we revisited the scene of this nightmare.<br/>
 Today's outing, like the previous outing was part of a larger plan to<br/>
grab other boxes in the area AND was a rainy nasty day (which, of<br/>
course, is totally appropriate).  While parking and suiting-up, we <br/>
were cracking jokes about how much fun it would be to leave the cars<br/>
lights on (for the record WhisperFoot did not leave the car lights on<br/>
today!).  And, as I was intimately (overly) familiar with the clues<br/>
and the hill, WhisperFoot took the lead and took us right to the box.<br/>
 It turns out that the clues were very, very vague and misleading<br/>
about the "3/4 up the trail" --- "up the trail" is subjective.  The<br/>
Planter really meant "3/4 up to the first switchback" to a side trail,<br/>
not "3/4 up the trail", of which I never actually found the end of...<br/>
the fire road continued on for miles into the wilderness.  While<br/>
stamping-in, I relished in other boxers notes talking about how vague<br/>
the clues were and how they had walked MUCH further up the main hill<br/>
than necessary... at least I am not the only one that had trouble with<br/>
the clues! :)<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, that is the story.  What should have been a 15min drive-by<br/>
turned into one of the worst letterboxing days we have ever had which, <br/>
after the passage of time, has turned into a funny anecdotal story<br/>
that only a fellow letterboxer would truely understand.  Looking back<br/>
this box was truely one of "Life's Little Adventures"!  And, at least<br/>
from today's perspective, I am happy to have experienced it.  As a<br/>
side-note:  I am happy to report that today I did *not* burn the<br/>
letterbox in a Kingsford pyre, as I threatened after humping up and<br/>
down that hill three times in a soaking cold rain...<br/>
<br/>
I am sure that all hikers and 'boxers, no matter how seasoned, have<br/>
their own Stories.<br/>
<br/>

Adventure" very much.  In fact, the first time I attempted this box <br/>
it was raining and I also had much trouble finding it.  I actually <br/>
figured out the 3/4 way up the hill part but I had a hard time <br/>
finding the heavily carved tree with the rock.  Once I went back it <br/>
was so obvious but the first time, in the rain, I just couldn't put <br/>
it together.  Your story is much more frustration filled than mine <br/>
but yet it made me smile that I wasn't the only one challenged by <br/>
this seemimgly simple drive-by!  Misery loves company.<br/>

DO?  ....is<br/>
&gt; it ...charged?   great (...too tired at this point to muster any <br/>
real<br/>
&gt; enthusiasm, I know that I will have to climb that abominable hill<br/>
&gt; again).   "How much signal do you have?"  "None."   "Yeah, that is<br/>
&gt; about right...." and back up I go.  This time I am successful in<br/>
&gt; getting through to AAA and getting a service truck dispatched.  <br/>
Before <br/>
&gt; hanging-up, the dispatcher tells me the estimated time it will take<br/>
&gt; the service truck:  2hrs.   2HRS!?, Oh, thats right, it's <br/>
Thanksgiving<br/>
&gt; Day and *everyone* is off enjoying the holiday... back down the <br/>
hill.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; To conclude this flashback, the AAA truck arrived 1.5hrs later and<br/>
&gt; what should have been a 15min drive-by-box became a 4-5hr detour <br/>
into<br/>
&gt; a letterboxing-hell and a general Holiday nightmare.  We drove<br/>
&gt; straight home and did make Turkey-Day dinner with the family, but we<br/>
&gt; were not really in the holiday mood the rest of the night (not<br/>
&gt; terribly unexpected, right?).  As I recollect it, neither of us <br/>
joined<br/>
&gt; into the usual internecine-intrafamily political debates (I suppose<br/>
&gt; the family chalked it up to our being overly-stressed new parents --<br/>
&gt; they had no idea of the 1st half our our day and the *fun* we had at<br/>
&gt; the reservoir).<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; So, getting back to today:  we revisited the scene of this <br/>
nightmare.<br/>
&gt;  Today's outing, like the previous outing was part of a larger plan <br/>
to<br/>
&gt; grab other boxes in the area AND was a rainy nasty day (which, of<br/>
&gt; course, is totally appropriate).  While parking and suiting-up, we <br/>
&gt; were cracking jokes about how much fun it would be to leave the cars<br/>
&gt; lights on (for the record WhisperFoot did not leave the car lights <br/>
on<br/>
&gt; today!).  And, as I was intimately (overly) familiar with the clues<br/>
&gt; and the hill, WhisperFoot took the lead and took us right to the <br/>
box.<br/>
&gt;  It turns out that the clues were very, very vague and misleading<br/>
&gt; about the "3/4 up the trail" --- "up the trail" is subjective.  The<br/>
&gt; Planter really meant "3/4 up to the first switchback" to a side <br/>
trail,<br/>
&gt; not "3/4 up the trail", of which I never actually found the end <br/>
of...<br/>
&gt; the fire road continued on for miles into the wilderness.  While<br/>
&gt; stamping-in, I relished in other boxers notes talking about how <br/>
vague<br/>
&gt; the clues were and how they had walked MUCH further up the main hill<br/>
&gt; than necessary... at least I am not the only one that had trouble <br/>
with<br/>
&gt; the clues! :)<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Anyway, that is the story.  What should have been a 15min drive-by<br/>
&gt; turned into one of the worst letterboxing days we have ever had <br/>
which, <br/>
&gt; after the passage of time, has turned into a funny anecdotal story<br/>
&gt; that only a fellow letterboxer would truely understand.  Looking <br/>
back<br/>
&gt; this box was truely one of "Life's Little Adventures"!  And, at <br/>
least<br/>
&gt; from today's perspective, I am happy to have experienced it.  As a<br/>
&gt; side-note:  I am happy to report that today I did *not* burn the<br/>
&gt; letterbox in a Kingsford pyre, as I threatened after humping up and<br/>
&gt; down that hill three times in a soaking cold rain...<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I am sure that all hikers and 'boxers, no matter how seasoned, have<br/>
&gt; their own Stories.<br/>

&gt; &gt; "Life's Little Adventure",  A Letterboxing Story<br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; Today, WhisperFoot, Baby-Boo, and I found the<br/>
&gt; "Life's Little<br/>
&gt; &gt; Adventure" letterbox alongside the Loch Raven<br/>
&gt; Reservoir in<br/>
&gt; &gt; Cockeysville, Maryland.  Not a major<br/>
&gt; accomplishment typically worth<br/>
&gt; &gt; writing about: the box itself was in good shape,<br/>
&gt; it was an easy and<br/>
&gt; &gt; short hike, the logbook wasn't moldy, stamp was<br/>
&gt; store bought, plenty<br/>
&gt; &gt; of boxers have stamped in, less than 15mins round<br/>
&gt; trip from parking <br/>
&gt; to<br/>
&gt; &gt; stamping and back on the road.  Quick, easy,<br/>
&gt; standard fare - but the<br/>
&gt; &gt; name of the box and the entirety of the story<br/>
&gt; might be interesting <br/>
&gt; to<br/>
&gt; &gt; others infected with the Letterboxing parasite.<br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; So, today was actually our second attempt at<br/>
&gt; finding this box.  Our<br/>
&gt; &gt; first attempt was Thanksgiving Day '06. <br/>
&gt; Thanksgiving Day, you ask? <br/>
&gt; &gt; Yes, we try to get outdoors to hike and box on<br/>
&gt; every opportunity<br/>
&gt; &gt; including holidays.  The plan was to dash out grab<br/>
&gt; a few boxes, dash<br/>
&gt; &gt; home, and join the family for Turkey-day dinner. <br/>
&gt; We had chosen a<br/>
&gt; &gt; couple of drive-by/short-hike boxes in Baltimore<br/>
&gt; County Maryland<br/>
&gt; &gt; specifically because it was a nasty weather day<br/>
&gt; (raining, low-40's; <br/>
&gt; in<br/>
&gt; &gt; my opinion-probably the worst weather, period) and<br/>
&gt; because <br/>
&gt; WhisperFoot<br/>
&gt; &gt; had just given birth to Baby-Boo a couple of weeks<br/>
&gt; earlier and was<br/>
&gt; &gt; nursing.  After a relatively short drive and<br/>
&gt; finding another drive-<br/>
&gt; by<br/>
&gt; &gt; box we arrived at Life's Little Adventure.  The<br/>
&gt; rain hasn't let up <br/>
&gt; and<br/>
&gt; &gt; had, in fact, intensified.  Upon arriving Baby-Boo<br/>
&gt; woke-up and <br/>
&gt; started<br/>
&gt; &gt; demanding lunch, as newborns do.  Putting on our<br/>
&gt; multi-tasking hats<br/>
&gt; &gt; was a no-brainer; WhisperFoot &amp; Baby-Boo would<br/>
&gt; stay behind nice and<br/>
&gt; &gt; dry in the car, take care of feeding while I would<br/>
&gt; head out into the<br/>
&gt; &gt; downpour, find the box, stamp us in, and return. <br/>
&gt; Nothing<br/>
&gt; &gt; earthshattering with this plan except, as Robert<br/>
&gt; Burns so aptly <br/>
&gt; stated<br/>
&gt; &gt; "The best laid plans of mice and men often go<br/>
&gt; awry."  <br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; So, I suited-up and headed off down the trail to<br/>
&gt; find the box. <br/>
&gt; &gt; Whisperfoot and Baby-Boo stayed behind in the car,<br/>
&gt; which is parked <br/>
&gt; at<br/>
&gt; &gt; the bottom of a gully situated between several<br/>
&gt; large hills <br/>
&gt; overlooking<br/>
&gt; &gt; the Reservoir.  The trail heads uphill and the<br/>
&gt; Box's clue states <br/>
&gt; that<br/>
&gt; &gt; I should go "about 3/4 up the trail".  So I start<br/>
&gt; heading uphill.  <br/>
&gt; It<br/>
&gt; &gt; is fairly hard to describe how steep this hill is<br/>
&gt; and/or how long <br/>
&gt; the<br/>
&gt; &gt; trail is, but this is a substantial grade<br/>
&gt; following an, obviously<br/>
&gt; &gt; rarely-used, fire-road into the hills around the<br/>
&gt; Reservoir.  Being<br/>
&gt; &gt; that I follow directions rather literally, I look<br/>
&gt; up the hill and<br/>
&gt; &gt; calculate that "3/4 up the trail" is 3/4 up the<br/>
&gt; hill and it is going<br/>
&gt; &gt; to take me about 10-15mins strenuous hiking<br/>
&gt; through several<br/>
&gt; &gt; switchbacks until I should start looking for the<br/>
&gt; next part of the<br/>
&gt; &gt; clue-- which is a small side trail.  This is not<br/>
&gt; really the<br/>
&gt; &gt; drive-by/short-hike that we had in mind, but I am<br/>
&gt; already wet and I<br/>
&gt; &gt; have like 15-20 minutes to kill anyway as Baby-Boo<br/>
&gt; is feeding.  So,<br/>
&gt; &gt; I'm in pretty good shape, I go for it.  I climb<br/>
&gt; and climb and <br/>
&gt; climb. <br/>
&gt; &gt; At every switchback I look uphill to calculate how<br/>
&gt; much closer to <br/>
&gt; 3/4<br/>
&gt; &gt; up the hill I am, and I do keep an eye out for the<br/>
&gt; side trail -- <br/>
&gt; clues<br/>
&gt; &gt; are often fubar'd and backwards, right?   Climb,<br/>
&gt; climb, climb, and <br/>
&gt; the<br/>
&gt; &gt; trail never ends, and no side-trail in sight.  10<br/>
&gt; minutes turns into<br/>
&gt; &gt; 15, into 20; pass through switchback #3, 4, 5,<br/>
&gt; hey, now I can see <br/>
&gt; the<br/>
&gt; &gt; top of the hill and the houses that line the<br/>
&gt; hilltop --they have a<br/>
&gt; &gt; really nice view!-- but this damn trail keeps on<br/>
&gt; going.  I am now <br/>
&gt; out<br/>
&gt; &gt; of breath, and i realize that I have another<br/>
&gt; 20mins to get back to <br/>
&gt; the<br/>
&gt; &gt; car and that I must have *missed* the side-trail<br/>
&gt; (it is raining and <br/>
&gt; I<br/>
&gt; &gt; am only human, right?).  So I turn around and head<br/>
&gt; back down the <br/>
&gt; hill<br/>
&gt; &gt; - keeping an eye out for that side trail.  Down,<br/>
&gt; down, down through<br/>
&gt; &gt; all the switchbacks. No side trail.  Finally back<br/>
&gt; to the parking lot<br/>
&gt; &gt; and the car.  Okay, I think, I must be blind and<br/>
&gt; stupid, but its<br/>
&gt; &gt; raining and its a holiday so I will just email the<br/>
&gt; planter and ask <br/>
&gt; for<br/>
&gt; &gt; better clues. <br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; I get back to the car, totally soaked to the bone<br/>
&gt; all the way <br/>
&gt; through<br/>
&gt; &gt; my socks, where WhisperFoot gives me the "so this<br/>
&gt; was a drive-by?"<br/>
&gt; &gt; look; Baby-Boo had finished feeding 20mins ago and<br/>
&gt; is about to fall<br/>
&gt; &gt; back to sleep.  I explain what happened and<br/>
&gt; recommend that we punt <br/>
&gt; on<br/>
&gt; &gt; the rest of the day, go home, and just enjoy the<br/>
&gt; rest of the <br/>
&gt; holiday.<br/>
&gt; &gt;  WhisperFoot agrees and goes to start the car. <br/>
&gt; She turns the key <br/>
&gt; and<br/>
&gt; &gt; gets the dreaded -click--click--click- of a dead<br/>
&gt; car battery.  <br/>
&gt; While I<br/>
&gt; &gt; was off hunting the box we had accidentally left<br/>
&gt; the car lights on. <br/>
&gt; &gt; Oh shit- the ~45mins I was gone the freaking<br/>
&gt; lights had been on and<br/>
&gt; &gt; drained the battery.  Now what, we are basically<br/>
&gt; in the middle of<br/>
&gt; &gt; nowhere.  Okay.... We are AAA members in good<br/>
&gt; standing, right?  We <br/>
&gt; did<br/>
&gt; &gt; pay the membership last summer, right?  We will<br/>
&gt; just call them up <br/>
&gt; and<br/>
&gt; &gt; get jumpstart.  No big deal, happens all the time.<br/>
&gt;  Okay, we dig out<br/>
&gt; &gt; the membership card and fire-up the cell phone. <br/>
&gt; Whats this?  No<br/>

feel all exposed and such...  What Midnight Boxer forgot to mention<br/>
was that Whisper Foot was feeling incredibly awful for her<br/>
stupidity... I mean, after all, a new Mom up all hours of the day and<br/>
night attending to a newborn hardly getting any sleep whatsoever, one<br/>
can see how she could forget turning off the measly headlights!<br/>
So not wanting to wait 2 hours for AAA, I decided to go find help on<br/>
my own. MB was soaked to the bone and I felt like I had to share in<br/>
the misery too. I calmly told MB to come look for me if I'm not back<br/>
in 15 minutes and headed up the street in the pouring rain. I walked <br/>
a little ways to a creepy house, knocked on the door and asked for<br/>
jumper cables from a not-so-nice man... he, of course, did not have<br/>
any. Big, fat liar. So I went across the street to another creepy<br/>
house, (by this time I feel like I'm in Deliverance), knocked on the<br/>
door and asked for jumper cables from a very nice man who actually<br/>
came out to jump me!  Well, my car at least.. He pulls up just as AAA<br/>
shows up. So now I feel like total crap for #1, getting us stuck in<br/>
the first place and #2 dragging this nice man out of his cozy chair to<br/>
help a completely distressed, crazed mother who just wanted to find a<br/>
letterbox before eating some freaking turkey! <br/>
Yes, this LB was a little tricky to find and it was muddy as heck. But<br/>
that just added to the charm of finding a plastic container with a<br/>
little piece of Christmas inside in the middle of nowhere... :)<br/>
