    I have returned to these boards after a long layoff from posting, <br/>
planting, and finding letterboxes.  I had lost interest at the time <br/>
due to the direction of the hobby, and its overall lack of <br/>
creativity.  Well, I realize now, that I miss the creativity that the <br/>
hobby brought me, and the friends I have met doing this silly hobby.  <br/>
I have over the past few weeks, schemed up some boxes, with themes <br/>
that are meaningful to me....that will entertain the local masses.  <br/>
It's good to be back!..look for these to be released asap, as well, <br/>
as the final unveiling of Vespula's Castle.<br/>
<br/>
What else brought me back?.....Well i have been bombarded with emails <br/>
about my recent activities, and whereabouts.  I hosted an event on <br/>
12/15/2007, where I met old friends and many a new letterboxer.  <br/>
Oddly, here I met a letterboxer named "Trailing Emerson".  Over the <br/>
next few days, we chatted via email, before meeting yet again, at <br/>
Cyclonic's Herndon mini-meet on 12/23/2007.   Well....7 weeks later, <br/>
it has been an amazing ride, and it seems I have fallen deeply in <br/>
love with her.  So weird to say that, but its true, and crazy at the <br/>
same time.  She is by far, the most amazing person I have ever met, <br/>
inside and out.  I have left out many details, but it has been the <br/>
most amazing weeks of my life.  If there ever is a soulmate, this is <br/>
it....You always find the most amazing things where you least expect <br/>
them, and this is the case, with what i found with Trailing Emerson.<br/>
<br/>
Yea, shocking, huh...<br/>

hobbies and a love of locks ;)<br/>
<br/>
   I'd love nothing more than to have a room right now, trust me.  <br/>
The thing is that that gets pricey, and doesnt always go as <br/>
planned...trust me on that....I'm experienced in the numerous <br/>
maritial affairs that I have had over the years..I even prefer the <br/>
same hotel everytime.....I mean, that's what people assume, <br/>
right?..geesh!<br/>
<br/>
....seems as if this has caused such an uproar and is quite odd.  <br/>
Others post love stories, get the biggest reception, and <br/>
congradulations.  Yet, it seems as if something BullDawg is fobidden <br/>
to do....quite interesting.  Things are not always as they seem in <br/>
relationships now are they.  Ya cant judge a book by its cover, thus <br/>
you cant get the entire story, by just reading the binding. This is <br/>
true of older stories, and the newer novels of my life. Yet, people <br/>
choose to do an entire book review without once opening the book, but <br/>
yet assuming its content. Then they critique the author and editor in <br/>
harsh term either in writing or in their head, when they nothing of <br/>
the quite legit circumstances as to their meeting, and collaboration <br/>
on the book.  Even when the union of the 2 to create the new chapters <br/>
was done after conacting all others involved with the author.  The <br/>
others refered to will be properly compensated and taken care of.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
....or is this just a clue to a library box in Sterling, VA<br/>
<br/>
BullDawg, still "alive" in the eyes of most<br/>

&gt; &gt; &gt;     I have returned to these boards after a long layoff from <br/>
&gt; &gt; posting, <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; planting, and finding letterboxes.  I had lost interest at the <br/>
time <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; due to the direction of the hobby, and its overall lack of <br/>

that <br/>
&gt; &gt; the <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; hobby brought me, and the friends I have met doing this silly <br/>
&gt; &gt; hobby.  <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; I have over the past few weeks, schemed up some boxes, with <br/>
themes <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; that are meaningful to me....that will entertain the local <br/>
masses.  <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; It's good to be back!..look for these to be released asap, as <br/>
well, <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; as the final unveiling of Vespula's Castle.<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; What else brought me back?.....Well i have been bombarded with <br/>
&gt; &gt; emails <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; about my recent activities, and whereabouts.  I hosted an event <br/>
on <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; 12/15/2007, where I met old friends and many a new <br/>
letterboxer.  <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; Oddly, here I met a letterboxer named "Trailing Emerson".  Over <br/>
the <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; next few days, we chatted via email, before meeting yet again, <br/>
at <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; Cyclonic's Herndon mini-meet on 12/23/2007.   Well....7 weeks <br/>
&gt; &gt; later, <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; it has been an amazing ride, and it seems I have fallen deeply <br/>
in <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; love with her.  So weird to say that, but its true, and crazy <br/>
at <br/>
&gt; &gt; the <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; same time.  She is by far, the most amazing person I have ever <br/>
met, <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; inside and out.  I have left out many details, but it has been <br/>
the <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; most amazing weeks of my life.  If there ever is a soulmate, <br/>

I am not stone throwing, I am expressing my reactions here. I have met Bulldawg's wife and kids and these posts were very upsetting to me as I wasn't sure if they were clues or the real situation of a family in distress. I must admit it hit a little too close to home for me to find it cute or funny or intriuging. After 20 years together my first husband left me and my two sons for another woman. So from my prespectvie there is no way I would have found this amusing, or mysterious. Especially knowing and camping with his wife and kids. I did email him privately offline to express my concern if this was real, my fondess for his wife and kids and wished him well whatever the situation was and simply said I hoped he knew what he was doing. But I am sorry, I don't think this way of posting a hidden clue was the best choice. Too many families are
 broken up this way and for those of us who have been through this, it's not funny, it's heartbreaking. So I am not throwing stones, and except for once or twice a year when I act like an @$$hole online, I usually don't do that. But I think those who reacted strongly, or perhaps overreacted are those who know the family and were hurt or upset at what was presented here as a very real situation by Bulldawg himself. Bulldawg admits he loves to shock and create controversy, so I am sure he got the reaction he was hoping for with this. I would have preferred he not use the "joke" of an extramarital affair and the possible disintigration of a family that I had grown fond of as a vehicle for delivering a clue. </div> <div> </div> <div>And no, it's no Mr. Irene and I who broke up, it was my first husband who left. Mr. Irene  (Harris) is still hanging in there after 13 years together, God love 'im!<br/></div> <div>Okay, fire up the flame throwers. I don't give
