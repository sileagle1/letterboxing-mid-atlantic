<div> </div>
<div>Saturday I am going to try to do the domestic thing and do something about this wreck of a house. Although every time I plan that some letterboxing project lures me away...</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Sunday I will not be Hikers &amp; Hounds but "the Mad Hatter" as part of the Red Hat Boxers going boxing in Lancaster. Carvin Carmen is working on a really cool sig stamp for me, a really cool ladies hat but with the sales ticket of the Mad Hatter in the hatband "In this style 10/6" and a big funky feather, but doesn't know if it will be done in time. He's been sidelined this week.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Since Dude is not female he is not invited to the Red Hat event. He's been pouting all week but he'll just have to get over it! And Jasmine, my other dog, is still too young, she's only 7 in people years, the minimum age is 45. I'm just squeakin' in myself.</div>
