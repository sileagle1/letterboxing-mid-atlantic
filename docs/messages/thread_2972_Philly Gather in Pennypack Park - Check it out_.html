other activities all day as you choose. <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; About 2 PM a brief guided tour of a nearby stable, where a rescued &amp;<br/>
other horses offer programs for therapeutic riding (hopefully) and/or<br/>
a stamp overlooking this Park stable (or other activities as you<br/>
choose). THIS TOUR IS NOT PET FRIENDLY.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; About 2:30 PM a free guided park walk on historic Burholme hilltop<br/>
with (on clear days) 30 mile views (or self guiding walk (at any time)<br/>
if you prefer) or other activities as you choose. <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; About 3 PM a free tour of Historic Burholme Mansion &amp; Ryerss Art<br/>
Museum or other activities as you choose. This tour allows children w/<br/>
an adult. NO PETS IN BUILDING.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; About 4 PM last chance for Event Letterboxes in Burholme walking area.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; About 5 PM tailgate lemonade or iced tea, stamps, a few prizes, etc.<br/>
atop Burholme Hill.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; This will involve a drive of about 3 miles to the 3 park areas w/<br/>
event stamps. Plus any drive to other area stamps or activities you<br/>
may choose. <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; A lawn chair would be a good idea, as would a sun shade or rain fly<br/>
if you want. <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; We will go rain or shine w/ the basic idea &amp; at least 6<br/>
horse/history stamps if anyone at all is interested (i.e. signs up). <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; There at many fine restaurants &amp; diners etc in Burholme area.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; We are opened to &amp; hoping for suggestions to improve or expand this<br/>
concept. <br/>
&gt; REMEMBER: to check back for evolving details &amp; new info.<br/>

&gt; &gt; Hey gang,<br/>
&gt; &gt;    <br/>
&gt; &gt;   Mars888 (I think I have the correct number of 8's here) are<br/>
&gt; hosting a gather in NE Philly in the spring. It's posted on AQ but<br/>
&gt; thought I'd copy it here as well.<br/>
&gt; &gt;    <br/>
&gt; &gt;    <br/>
&gt; &gt;   We had an idea for an event &amp; have posted to reserve the day &amp; to<br/>
&gt; see the level of interest in our idea. <br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; We hope to involve letterboxes, art, history, outdoor fun, good<br/>
&gt; scenery &amp; company into a fun day. This will be RSVP only.<br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; THE CONCEPT WOULD GO LIKE THIS: <br/>
&gt; &gt; 11 AM meet &amp; greet at a Pennypack Park landscaped hilltop, at an<br/>
&gt; equine ring site overlooking an historic 1800's large animal rescue<br/>
&gt; farm (Ryerss Farm) for clues, brief history, &amp; stamps. Then event or<br/>
&gt; other activities all day as you choose. <br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; About 2 PM a brief guided tour of a nearby stable, where a rescued &amp;<br/>
&gt; other horses offer programs for therapeutic riding (hopefully) and/or<br/>
&gt; a stamp overlooking this Park stable (or other activities as you<br/>

&gt; Museum or other activities as you choose. This tour allows children w/<br/>
&gt; an adult. NO PETS IN BUILDING.<br/>

&gt; &gt; Then I'd love to go! There are boxes I have not found there, too.<br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>

&gt; &gt; &gt; Yes, we can get you there and back don't worry. Either pick up/drop<br/>
&gt; &gt; off at your place, a train station or the El. Just sign up and it'll<br/>
&gt; &gt; get worked out.<br/>
