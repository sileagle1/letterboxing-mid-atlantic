As I am still learning the ropes I have a question to pose.  On our <br/>
outing yesterday we found one of the boxes basically destroyed by <br/>
weather.  The top had come off, the baggies were ripped and the logbook <br/>
ruined.  All that was left was the stamp and ink pad.  Rather than <br/>
leave it there in that state I took it home with me and posted a note <br/>
to the placer on Atlas Quest.  I haven't heard back yet.  Should I have <br/>
left it there and then contacted them?  Or should I just repair it and <br/>
return it myself?  As a footnote, the 2nd box in the series was not in <br/>
much better shape.  The baggies were ripped, top leaking and stamp <br/>
missing.  I was able to close that one back up pretty well and informed <br/>
the placer about this one too.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks!<br/>

<br/>
I've come across some the same way.  I try to repair them as best I can. <br/>
I have gotten into the habit of carrying extra freezer ziplock with me.  I<br/>
haven't gotten to the point of extra logs though.  I also try to have some<br/>
paper towels to "attempt" to dry out soggy books.<br/>
<br/>
Sometimes they are just beyond the beyond.  I came across a stamp in<br/>
Waldwick NJ, the container and bags were in absolutely horrible shape.  I<br/>
could only stamp my book.  The logbook was SO soggy that it was crumbling<br/>
into mush.<br/>
<br/>
There wasn't anything I could do but write the owner.  It is an old box<br/>
and I was sorry that I couldn't leave my entry.  I didn't get a response<br/>
but hope it he/she was able to repair it.<br/>
<br/>
What series of stamps, can I ask?  If I haven't done it, I will try to<br/>
remember to bring replacements with me.<br/>

<font face="Verdana, Helvetica, Arial"><span style="font-size:12.0px;">I have stood at a box MANY times trying to decide what to do. In 2 cases – the boxes were so small that I had to remove the wet and in 1 case frozen log book to get note cards in.  In another case the boxer that planted it live several states away and I just decided that I would take the chance and replace the whole thing. In all cases – everyone has been super nice about me removing their logbook. I always dry them out and mail them to the owner on my stamp. I only do it if I really feel the need and can replace it. Honestly I would hope someone would do the same for me, cause I can’t always get out right away to replace things.  <br/>

I don't bring extra logs, but a few index cards with<br/>
the extra ziplocks.  That way I can at least leave my<br/>
stamp image amidst the soggy mess, and a  little bit of<br/>
space for the next few boxers.<br/>
<br/>
I did break etiquette  once and bring home a soggy<br/>
logbook. I knew the planters are out of the  game. I<br/>
dried it off and put it in a new box and put it back<br/>
out there.  It still had good pages in it once it was<br/>
dry.<br/>

&gt; Hi,<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I've come across some the same way. I  try to repair<br/>
&gt; them as best I can. <br/>
&gt; I have gotten into the  habit of carrying extra<br/>
&gt; freezer ziplock with me. I<br/>
&gt; haven't  gotten to the point of extra logs though. I<br/>
&gt; also try to have  some<br/>
&gt; paper towels to "attempt" to dry out soggy books.<br/>
&gt;  <br/>
&gt; Sometimes they are just beyond the beyond. I came<br/>
&gt; across a  stamp in<br/>
&gt; Waldwick NJ, the container and bags were in<br/>
&gt;  absolutely horrible shape. I<br/>
&gt; could only stamp my book. The logbook was  SO soggy<br/>
&gt; that it was crumbling<br/>
&gt; into mush.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt;  There wasn't anything I could do but write the<br/>
&gt; owner. It is an old  box<br/>
&gt; and I was sorry that I couldn't leave my entry. I<br/>
&gt; didn't  get a response<br/>
&gt; but hope it he/she was able to repair it.<br/>
&gt;  <br/>
&gt; What series of stamps, can I ask? If I haven't done<br/>
&gt; it, I  will try to<br/>
&gt; remember to bring replacements with me.<br/>
