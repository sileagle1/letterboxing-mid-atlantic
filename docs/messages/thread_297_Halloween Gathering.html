<div>Meanwhile I am planning to carve a new stamp for Christmas Tree Graveyards by Halloween.  Each year we retrieve a dead tree from that cemetery, haul it back to our front yard and set it up as a "Nightmare Before Christmas" tree.  It looks great among all the headstones we put up in the yard.  I plan to hide mini-boxes behind the headstones of store bought Edward Gorey stamp images.  Store bought?!  Yeah, but they are very cool.  So one could do the Christmas Tree Graveyards box and then wander up to the halloween graveyard in front of our house.  </div>

                    <div id="ygrps-yiv-1539735656">Okie Dokie, So it's set... October 30th. There are 3 parks withing <br/>
about 8 miles of each other.  Hemlock Overlook is also there.  SamIam <br/>
has three boxes there that are currently pulled I think.  Bunnyman <br/>
bridge, a VA mystery box is also kinda near there.  It would be a <br/>
prefect box for Halloween.  I'm also planning to plant a GMU box in <br/>
the next week or so at GMU.  I've been planning to all summer long.  <br/>
I just got a job at VCU, and my last day is the 8th, so I need to <br/>
hurry up and get it carved.<br/>
<br/>
My plans were just to keep it simple.  Wether a few people show up, <br/>
or a few dozen, it'll be fun, at least I think.  We'll meet, we'll <br/>
talk we'll box, we'll plant,  we'll talk, well, stamp, and then we <br/>
can either go out to eat afterwards, or go on our separate ways.<br/>
<br/>
When I started letterboxing in May, I could've sworn that there were <br/>
boxes in Occoquan regional, but I can't find them online now.  Maybe <br/>
I'm just not looking hard enough.  I do have a stamp that I plan to <br/>
plant out there.  There is some intersting history in that park.  <br/>
There is apparently an old Indian cemetary, or perhaps just a section <br/>
marked off that they believe marks the spot an Indian chief is <br/>
buried.  Also perfect for a Halloween gathering.<br/>
<br/>
Manda<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
PS. Parks on 123.  Occoquan, Foutainhead regional park(there is a <br/>
series of 5 planted there I know, and a couple of others) and Burke <br/>
Lake Park(at least one box that I know of)<br/>
<br/>
BTW&lt; Judy, I love your idea of carving alternate personal stamps ;)<br/>
