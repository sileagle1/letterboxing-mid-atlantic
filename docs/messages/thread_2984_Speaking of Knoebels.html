to announce the 4th annual gathering, Knoebels '08!<br/>
<br/>
It is a little later this year, September 20th, on account of the <br/>
massive Oregon gathering.<br/>
<br/>
This year the gathering will be in pavilion P-3.  This pavilion is <br/>
behind the Sklooosh, and we will have it all to ourselves, with plenty <br/>
of room for everyone.<br/>
<br/>
Bring your own food or sample some of the great food at the park.  As <br/>
always, well behaved dogs are welcome into the park (find an amusement <br/>
park that lets you do that?)<br/>
<br/>
An update on the camping will be coming soon.  Expect a separate sign-up <br/>
for camping this year so it can be better organized.  Let me know how <br/>
receptive you might be to all pitching in on one of the large group cabins?<br/>

rolling, here is the information on Knoebels this year.<br/>
<br/>
Once again we will be returning to one of the best amusement parks <br/>
anywhere, Knoebels Amusement Resort!<br/>
<br/>
*The Gathering*<br/>
<br/>
This gathering is totally free, as you don't have to pay admission into <br/>
the park. Rides do cost, but you don't have to ride if you don't want <br/>
to. If you do, you can get ride tickets or a wristband to ride all day, <br/>
which you may want to do as the park has some of the best rides <br/>
anywhere, including the top rated Phoenix rollercoaster.<br/>
<br/>
We will again be returning to Pavillion P-3, which is a cool spot near <br/>
the creek. The gathering starts early so that everyone can have a chance <br/>
to enjoy the park later.<br/>
<br/>
*Camping*<br/>
<br/>
Once again we hope to have some great fun at the campground after the <br/>
gathering. There WILL be night boxing this year near the campsites.<br/>
<br/>
Camp HQ is in a different location this year, site Q-X in the Quebec <br/>
circle. There are lots of sites left, but the campground is filling up <br/>
fast. call the park today to reserve a site:<br/>
<br/>
1-800-487-4386<br/>
<br/>
As usual, no sign-ups are required, just come on up for some fun.  This <br/>
is a mostly social letterboxing event, a chance to meet and greet some <br/>
great folks, share stories and laughs.  You don't have to buy anything, <br/>
you don't have to give anything, just bring your logbook, sig stamp, and <br/>
a willingness to have a good time.  You can bring along the whole <br/>
family, including the dog, cat or rat, they are all welcome.<br/>
