<br/>
The way I see it there is more to a planted box then just planting a <br/>
box.  You have to keep up with the box, even if that means just keeping <br/>
the clues up to date as the box gets reported on, such as with my "Coney <br/>
Island Mermaid Heads West."  I may never see the box again, but it will <br/>
remain active so long as it is there and I get good reports (Thanks <br/>
MizScarlet!)  What good is having a plant if no one has any hope of <br/>
finding it because it does not exist.<br/>
<br/>
It is all a mater of opinion, of course, and your mileage will vary.<br/>

&gt;   Subject: [lbma] Deleted Plants from AQ<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt;   I was looking at someone's profile on AQ today. It said they had <br/>
152 <br/>
&gt;   planted boxes, but when I looked at their logbook, I found that <br/>
all but <br/>
&gt;   two boxes had been retired. I thought, that isn't right, those <br/>
boxes <br/>
&gt;   should not be counted, in my thinking anyway, as plants any <br/>
longer. <br/>
&gt;   Sure, they were planted at one time, but they are no longer <br/>
there, no <br/>
&gt;   longer being watched over, and no longer being found, so should <br/>
they <br/>
&gt;   really count toward PFX?<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt;   Now, it really is up to the individual person, it really only <br/>
matters to <br/>
&gt;   them, but I decided to go ahead and delete a bunch of my own <br/>
boxes which <br/>
&gt;   are retired. Anyone that had found them would have already logged <br/>
them, <br/>
&gt;   since they were all retired some time ago, so I decided out they <br/>
go.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt;   Just thought I would let anyone interested know, and maybe spark <br/>
some <br/>
&gt;   discussion as well.<br/>

career numbers, but I think I will still delete boxes after a certain <br/>
amount of time, since I still see it as a box should not be listed if it <br/>
is not there.<br/>

Like I said, not much for counting myself, but I do like AQ as a way to <br/>
keep a rough number, and I do like to know exactly how many boxes I have <br/>
out there.  I like to keep that 10% planted to found ratio, kinda a <br/>
thank you for all those that plant.<br/>

I do keep count of my career "stats", but prefer to do it off-line for a number of reasons.  A simple spreadsheet works fine for me and allows sorting, searching, counting, etc<br/>

of Pottstown.  They have decent pizza, awesome calzone, plenty of space, <br/>
and hand scooped ice cream.  A nice local place that I haven't been to <br/>

Definitely better then chain fast food.<br/>

the time/location change, we didn't make it either - we headed east <br/>

I didn't remove my name from the list.  I already emailed the guest <br/>

&gt; OK, what is going on with this thing?<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Otis' Friends has seemed to drop his RSVP from his own even listing <br/>
on <br/>
&gt; AQ.  Do we have a location and time?  Should I just take over here?<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; H&amp;H suggested a diner.  There are two in the area I have eaten at, <br/>
the <br/>
&gt; Pottstown Family Restaurant, that is along Rt. 100 in town, just a <br/>
block <br/>
&gt; north of High Street.  There is also the Coventry Diner, which is <br/>
on Rt. <br/>
&gt; 100 South below town.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Can we get an answer?<br/>
