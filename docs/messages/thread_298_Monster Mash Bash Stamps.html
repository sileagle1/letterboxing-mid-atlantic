30th to letterbox in three parks on 123 (road between I-95 and <br/>
Fairfax).  You're invited to join us. Nothing fancy here, just <br/>
letterboxing at its scariest.  If you can't come, but would like to <br/>
carve a monster stamp to be planted in one of the parks, please email <br/>
me privately for my address.  <br/>
<br/>
If you can come, and are a carver, carve a Jekyll to your normal Hyde <br/>
signature stamp, or your favorite monster, or both to be planted by <br/>
you after the exchange.<br/>
<br/>
Hope to see you there!<br/>
<br/>

PS.  A VA mystery box "Bunnyman Bridge" is very near to where we're <br/>
gathering if you're brave enough.</div>

(specific starting park) when you have them or is entry restricted to <br/>
me?  If so, I'll cancel it and you can post.<br/>

I already know who I will be . . . er, what stamp I'll carve.<br/>
