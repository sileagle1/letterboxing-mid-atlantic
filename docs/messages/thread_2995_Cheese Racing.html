held on the Left Coast in Richmond, CA in Sep 03!<br/>
<br/>
As I recall, Sir Balthazar and Jugglermouse (both sadly long removed <br/>
from our illustrious hobby) were the initial driving force behind the <br/>
races!<br/>
<br/>
They took the time to show us that Kraft single seemed to have <br/>
superior plastic, and that one would generally want to avoid the <br/>
cheaper, store-brand variety!<br/>
<br/>
At the San Luis Obispo gathering in Oct 03 we again had the chance to <br/>
try our luck, and this time, the Jigglets were victorious against such <br/>
luminaries as Amanda and Ryan, among others.<br/>
<br/>
The travelling event boxes refered to in an earlier post were <br/>
originally entitled "Yes On Cheese Racing" and "St Brie: No To Cheese <br/>
Racing" and were planted as traditional boxes. When Sir B and <br/>
Jugglermouse removed themselves from the scene, the boxes were pulled <br/>
and converted into travellers, and have appeared from time to time <br/>
since then. The last time we saw them I think was the Ithaca NY <br/>
gatherinmg in Jun 05... St Brie is still listed, but the Yes box is <br/>
not.<br/>
<br/>
Might be time to track 'em down!<br/>

had mentioned.  There is a great video on youtube with an "event" on <br/>
it.  It looks like it could get messy really fast if you weren't <br/>
careful---although I'm sure the same could be said for cheese racing.  <br/>
Does it matter if it's full fat or fat free cheese?  We've got Kraft <br/>
but it's the fat free kind...............<br/>
