Team Lightnin' Bug passed on a soggy Saturday to invade Bucks County <br/>
on Sunday and visit Lake Mock A Nixon (what our 7 yr old called it, <br/>
we know it's Nockamixon) and find some boxes.  We were impressed with <br/>
the LoTR Series and found the damaged Catch the Wind.  Looks like <br/>
there were some brave souls on Saturday (Divine Lotus, the Leafcutter <br/>
and the Cichlyd Guy) and we even found the Birdie Hitchhiker.  Dad <br/>
also planted the PA Lenape Museum Box in the Little Lehigh Parkway <br/>
after cutting the lawn today.  Nice weather invigorates!  Well, gotta <br/>
loggggggg in.<br/>

Are you BS'ing us? ;-) I am glad you guys ended up OK.<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, here is a topic for the week....<br/>
<br/>
What is the most dangerous creature you have encountered while boxing?<br/>
<br/>
I think a Bull would be pretty far up there.  It seems like a Bull <br/>
encounter of the first kind...<br/>

</span></blockquote>On one of my first letterboxing forays, I ran into some hikers coming the <br/>
other way down a mountain who told me that they had seen a bear off the <br/>
trail not too far ahead of me. One of them seemed to think it was far <br/>
enough off the trail and moving away that I wouldn't run into it if I <br/>
continued up  the trail, a second said that she wouldn't go up that trail, <br/>
and a third didn't have an opinion one way or the other. I discussed it <br/>
with them some more and decided that the bear hadn't been acting in any <br/>
threatening way, so I continued up the trail, making lots of noise to make <br/>
my presence know.<br/>
<br/>
I was moving pretty quickly, though, and my ears and eyes were attuned to <br/>
every noise in the woods -- and the chipmunks were particularly active (it <br/>
seems), so I kept jumping at every rustle in the leaves off the trail. <br/>
Finally, I stopped to catch my breath, kneeling on a log by the side of the <br/>
trail. That's when I noticed a movement off to my left on the other side of <br/>
the trail -- and saw a rattlesnake moving slowly directly down the side of <br/>
the path away from me. I froze in place, and it continued on, unfazed by my <br/>
presence. After it had moved on, I continued up the mountain, again moving <br/>
as quickly as I could to put distance between myself and the bear and now <br/>
the rattlesnake, and then came upon a very large black rat snake, right in <br/>
the middle of the trail. They're mostly harmless, but it was still big <br/>
enough that, if provoked, he would have made sure that I remembered him, <br/>
and I was moving so quickly that I really skidded when I put on the brakes <br/>
after seeing him.<br/>
<br/>
The damn chipmunks were really getting on my nerves, and then I turned a <br/>
corner and startled a flock of wild turkeys, who made tracks into the <br/>
woods, but not without giving me another good startle (since my senses were <br/>
by now on very high alert). When I finally got near the top of the <br/>
mountain, I was surprised again, this time by a white tail buck standing <br/>
about 15 feet away from me. He took one look, didn't like what he saw, and <br/>
bolted in the opposite direction.<br/>
<br/>
I never saw the bear, but needless to say I wasn't able to avoid feeling <br/>
his presence in the woods. And after all that, I wasn't able to find the <br/>
letterbox there!<br/>
<br/>
The spiders here in PA can get pretty big, but they're nothing compared to <br/>
the big wolf spider I found when I uncovered a letterbox (or geocache) in <br/>
Florida. They're supposedly harmless, but I was sure not to get close <br/>
enough to find out.<br/>
<br/>
And of course the bee or wasp or yellow jacket that stung me a couple of <br/>
weeks ago has to be on my list, since I apparently shrieked "like a girl" <br/>
when I was stung....<br/>

<br/>
Now, hiking and MTB'ing is another thing.<br/>
<br/>
I came across a bear cub (which quickly bolted off into the woods) <br/>
while hiking the AT coming down from Sunfish Pond in the Jersey side <br/>
of the Delaware Water Gap.  I was with a bunch of folks whoe thought <br/>
that I was kidding.<br/>
<br/>
I nearly ran over a timber rattler once while MTB'ing on the Lehigh <br/>
Gorge Trail about 10 miles out from Jim Thorpe.  Coiled up, buzzing <br/>
and ready to strike!  That *WAS* unsettling, so I can imagine how you <br/>
felt first getting hyper aware of chipmunks and then running into <br/>
your rattler.<br/>
<br/>
Moral is, lets be careful out there, especially when getting into <br/>
nooks and crannies.<br/>

<div>I didn't have much time for boxing this weekend, mainly because I wasn't feeling well on Saturday and spent most of it on the couch.  On Sunday I found the two boxes hidden in Rock Creek Park before meeting some friends for dinner so that was my adventure!  Now that I have a car again I hope to do some boxing in the evenings, as I get out of work at 3:30 which gives me lots of free time in the evenings....</div>

Are you BS'ing us? ;-) I am glad you guys ended up OK. <br/>
<br/>
Anyway, here is a topic for the week.... <br/>
<br/>
What is the most dangerous creature you have encountered while boxing? <br/>
<br/>
I think a Bull would be pretty far up there.  It seems like a Bull <br/>
encounter of the first kind... <br/>

a <br/>

some <br/>

&gt; the wire fence (after seeing a sign that said don't do that, b/c a <br/>
&gt; bull was out in the field). We managed to tromp through the field <br/>
(I <br/>
&gt; was convinced I was going to get speared by a bull) and make it <br/>
back <br/>
&gt; to the car, but without finding boxes 2 and 3. Some other day... <br/>

<div><font face="Arial" family="SANSSERIF" size="2">A few weeks ago I had a nasty run in with some yellow jackets.  I was at Ringing Rocks, making my way across the field, pounding on every rock I came across, when while standing on one rock I heard a buzzing noise.  I looked up thinking it was an airplane flying over, but saw none.  I then looked down and saw about four or five yellow jackets.  After a quick explicative, I shifted my weight to jump away, but ended up shifting the whole rock.  Now, instead of four or five bees, there were forty of fifty bees.  Swiftly I leapt from rock to rock until I reached the end of the field.  I did not know I could move that fast anymore.  I managed to get away with only three of four stings, most of the bees went for my legs which were stress from the leaping and resisted them.</font></div>
