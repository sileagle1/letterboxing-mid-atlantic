<div><font face="Arial" size="2">I'm so sorry Irene. That's awful. Life is SO damn 
short. I wonder if some people realize just *how* short. I think you have to get 
more years behind you and less in front of you to really appreciate that fact. 
You're right, we waste too much energy getting upset about petty crap, here and 
elsewhere. It makes :::me::: feel good that my silliness brightened your day at 
a time when you needed it.  I kind of needed to feel good too, so I thank 
you. It goes both ways. </font></div>
