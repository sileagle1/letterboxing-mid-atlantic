<br/>
I'm being sent off to a two day training at the Fairfax campus of GMU <br/>
next week. I've been scanning the box listings in Fairfax, but since <br/>
I'm not familiar with the area and my free time (during the daylight) <br/>
will be rather limited I was wondering in anyone could clue me in as <br/>
to which boxes are nearer the campus?<br/>
<br/>
Thanks,<br/>

                    <div id="ygrps-yiv-1422203064">on LB.org you want VA - Northern VA - Fairfax County and within that area:<br/>
Annandale (9-11 mi East - 15-25 min)<br/>
Burke &amp; Burke Lake Park (6 mi South - 10 min)<br/>
Chantilly (9mi SE - 15 min)<br/>
Vienna (8 mi North - 25 min)<br/>
Springfield is a big area so some may be close enough, others 30+min<br/>
Dunn Loring (9 mi NE - 20 min)<br/>
<br/>
Well this should keep you busy.  A lot of boxes are missing so you'll<br/>
have to look up each of the clues (unfortunately the titles aren't<br/>
marked MIA)<br/>
<br/>
If you want to meet up to box - email me off list and let me know<br/>
which two days you are available.<br/>
