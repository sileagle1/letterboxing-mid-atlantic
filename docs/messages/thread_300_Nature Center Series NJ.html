                    <div id="ygrps-yiv-379359381">Very late box report here. I went there a few weeks ago!? I took my <br/>
Mom. The mile+ walk was more than enough for her, bless her. It was a <br/>
very nice day and a lovely walk through the forest.<br/>
<br/>
The clues mention numbered trail markers but some of them are <br/>
missing. This effects the search for one box more than the other, at <br/>
least for right now. I asked a guy in the office about it and he said <br/>
that previous managers of the property installed the markers. Audobon <br/>
is there now and they are not going to replace the missing ones and <br/>
have removed some as well.<br/>
<br/>
Both boxes were intact but one was visible from the trail -looked <br/>
like a wash out- and the second wasn't well covered. It was wet <br/>
inside too, but the log was OK.<br/>
