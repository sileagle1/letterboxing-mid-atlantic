upcoming gathering.<br/>
<br/>
This year's gathering theme will be the same as last year's, no theme. <br/>
We don't need no stinkin' theme to have a great time!<br/>
<br/>
The gathering will start at about 10AM at the Greene Pavilion, which is <br/>
just inside the park's gate. You are welcome to come earlier if you <br/>
like. We will have the pavilion area all to ourselves, with plenty of <br/>
parking, bathrooms, and even a playground for the little ones.<br/>
<br/>
The park already has more then 30 boxes hidden it, but you can expect <br/>
more boxes of all types to find their way there. Also expect plenty of <br/>
table treats and event boxes, bring as many as you like.<br/>
<br/>
Food will be total pot luck. Bring your favorite dish to contribute. <br/>
Flatware, dishes, cups, soda and water will be provided.<br/>
<br/>
Sadly, the gathering will not include a camping element this year. The <br/>
group sites are all filled up at the moment, though this may change. I <br/>
am working on possible alternatives as well, but right now it looks like <br/>
there will be no camping.<br/>

</span></blockquote>I did investigate some other options.  The problem with NJ State Parks is if you want to reserve a site, there is a minimum of two nights required, except for the groups sites, which is why Wash Crossing worked so well.<br/>
<br/>
Bulls Island State Park is just up the rive and has about 70 sites, so with, some without electric.  There are some private campgrounds in the area as well.  I am also considering looking into Tohicken Valley Park, a county park in Point Pleasant that has a camp ground.  All these locations are about half an hour from the park.<br/>

Thanks again to you and everyone involved in the 'Still No Theme <br/>
Gathering' last weekend.  It was a good day for food and meeting new <br/>
friends.  You were a great host and along with a couple of "surprise" <br/>
guests and some well planted boxes - it was certainly a memorable day.<br/>

How is the Boo-Boo on your head? That was one nasty Beech tree! (Guess <br/>
you can say it was a Be-itch.) But at least we found the box! Maybe you <br/>
should have checked with BandAid, heard she has a stamp for Boo-Boos <br/>
from Letterboxing adventures! ;-)<br/>

Look forward to more adventures!<br/>

&gt; &gt; &gt; Gathering' last weekend.  It was a good day for<br/>
&gt; &gt; food and meeting new <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; friends.  You were a great host and along with a<br/>

I think Warrior Woman up in NE somewhere manages that postal Boo Boo <br/>
box.  Sheeeeba got it for getting hit by a disc golf disc and I got <br/>
it for dislocating a shoulder.<br/>
<br/>
I think Warrior Woman goes off line during the summer (that is <br/>
presuming the box is still active), so you may need to work fast.<br/>

<p>That is definately "Boo Boo Box" worthy. Gotta watch them hobbits.<br/><br/>I think Warrior Woman up in NE somewhere manages that postal Boo Boo <br/>box. Sheeeeba got it for getting hit by a disc golf disc and I got <br/>it for dislocating a shoulder.<br/><br/>I think Warrior Woman goes off line during the summer (that is <br/>presuming the box is still active), so you may need to work fast.<br/><br/>LB<br/><br/>--- In <a href="mailto:lbma%40yahoogroups.com" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">lbma@yahoogroups. com</a>, "John" &lt;jerseytrailblazers @...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Haha - really nice :) The scab is healing nicely - thank you.

It was a good day for food and <br/>meeting <br/>&gt; new <br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; friends. You were a great host and along with a couple <br/>&gt; of "surprise" <br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; guests and some well planted boxes - it was certainly a <br/>memorable <br/>&gt; day.<br/>&gt; &gt;
 &gt; I look forward to the next time we are all able to get together.<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; <br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; -John<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt;<br/><br/></p></div></blockquote>
