<br/>
I moved to Newport News a while ago, have been adopting some of the <br/>
abandoned boxes here and am planning to take on this series.<br/>
<br/>
I've been doing some research and have concluded that the stamp for <br/>
box #1 went missing pretty early on, and the box #4 is probably <br/>
forever lost.  These boxes were planted before Hurricane Isabel <br/>
devastated the park and in the cleanup the paths at that end of the <br/>
park were changed a bit. Also, as far as I can tell, the trees that <br/>
were one of the main clues are no longer there. (in hurricane <br/>
country you can't count on trees being permanent landmarks).  BTW - <br/>
there is a message on AQ that describes some history and previous <br/>
maintanence.<br/>

<br/>
I was hoping to get images of the original stamps and replace stamp <br/>
#1 and replant #4.  Did anyone on this list ever find box #1 while <br/>
it still had the original stamp? and has anyone EVER found box #4?<br/>
<br/>
Thanks,<br/>
