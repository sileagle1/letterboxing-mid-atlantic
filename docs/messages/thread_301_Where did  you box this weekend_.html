I had a great time with some terrific women. Sowsewbizzy (aka Judy B, Top Hat Boxer) was our organizer, Mary from VA, Daughter of the Old Dominion was there as well as two Yanks, Miz Scarlet and myself, in the persona of The Mad Hatter. We found 6 boxes (I think) , planted our first box as a team and had a great day in this beautiful weather. I encourage any women over the age of 45 within a 2 hour driving distance of Fairfax, Va to join this group. I am not usually into "girl bonding" type things. This is not that, it's just a blast.  We probably won't do this again for a couple of months....can't wait! Oh, and my sig stamp rocks! Way to go Carvin' Carmen.</div>

<p>Then we were shut out looking for MistyMoo and Fish Adventures.  I don't mind that people come in the hobby, plant in unfortunate places, and then disappear.  It happens; we're all new and inexperienced sometime.  What annoys is LbNA not having a good way to track or post that boxes are missing.  One box I knew was missing for over a year I finally adopted just so I could edit the clue myself.  </p>
<p>Atlasquest is on the right course with tracking finds but I am not sure you can mark boxes as suspected missing.</p>
<p>Poor MistyMoo was in a place that was a fun idea, unfortunately it was also in a creek's retaining rocks.  Certain to be washed away.  Fish Adventures was a lovely spot but just wasn't isolated enough with enough cover.  Well, that is unless I was really way off.  But the clues were clear and obvious so...  Still, as usual, we enjoyed getting out there on a nice day.  Both were great places to visit.  </p>

<p>War &amp; I went to Mansfield CT this weekend.  What a blast!  We found over 20 boxes despite the on and off rain.  I was  in a cemetary when I was spotted from the road by Chuck (of Chuck &amp; Molly- Monster Mash organizer).  Turns out I was finding his box.  What a nice guy! He invited us back to his house for an exchange.  That was the first time we ever met another letterboxer and thus our first exchange.  Met Barb &amp; Molly too.  Then as War was rehiding a box yesterday "Leader of the Pack" came along.  It was her box.  We did exchanges with her and her son and went back to her house for her house box.  It was so nice to meet her since we had found a lot of her boxes this weekend.  What nice people letterboxers are if the ones we met are indicative of the others.</p>
<p>So now we've got a feel for Mansfield and are really looking forward to the Monster Mash.  What a great town!</p>

                    <div id="ygrps-yiv-791224462">I boxed up at Lake Nockamixion on Saturday. Things were going good <br/>
that day at first. I checked on my Hungry Termites box, everything <br/>
was good with the box so I hiked on over to the first LoTR box. Once <br/>
I got there I realized that I forgot my signature stamp back at home. <br/>
LOL I was in such I rush to get out boxing, I totally forgot it. Has <br/>
anyone else done this before? So I headed back home to get it. That <br/>
caused me to lose an about an hour of letterboxing time. So now <br/>
everything is cool. I was finding the rest of the LoTr series with no <br/>
problems until the rain hit after I found my 4th box. I got soaked! <br/>
My hiking boots are still a little damp. So that ended my <br/>
letterboxing day. I plan on finding the last two some time this week. <br/>
So overall it wasn't a bad day, 4 boxes found. Have a great day.<br/>

Happy Letterboxing<br/>

Erin is now a freshman at Cedarville University, and we were out for <br/>
the getting started weekend. CU being our own alma mater, we know <br/>
the area, and I've been itching to box in our old stomping ground. <br/>
BUT, knowing that we should focus on and spend time with Erin, I <br/>
only printed out clues for two boxes, and we didn't go till Sunday <br/>
afternoon when she was well settled and about ready for a nap.<br/>
The Indian Mound box outside C'ville was a quick, easy box, in one <br/>
of those places that deserves recognition with a box.<br/>
The Indian Resting Place box in John Bryan State Park was more of a <br/>
hike. It was on a part of the trails we hadn't explored before, and <br/>
we couldn't figure out why we hadn't. This box was placed by <br/>
ScoutDogs while out doing the Valley of the Frogs series with Wanda. <br/>
So when the hike took us past two of the frogs, it included notes on <br/>
when to switch to the frog clues. One note just left me gazing <br/>
around saying, "somewhere around here...", but at the <br/>
simple "Ribbit" put in later on, Wayne insisted he could guess <br/>
exactly where the box was. He did, and now we have an unidentified <br/>
frog stamped into the book. I'll have to go through all the frog <br/>
clues to see which he is. AND print them out in anticipation of <br/>
Homecoming in October....<br/>
