there any carvers out there willing to donate their time and talents to some wv 
teen girl scouts?  Our teen girl scouts work at day camp so they don't get 
to participate in many activities.  They get to have a little time before 
bed but after working with 100 younger girls they are too tired to really enjoy 
it then.  This year we would like to offer them letterboxing to do on their 
own.  There is only about half a dozen of them so we thought we would hide 
boxes all over the camp and for a certain amount of time each day they can go 
off without the younger ones and find them.  With all the prep work we need 
to do for camp I don't have time to carve all the stamps myself.  (I am the 
only adult who letterboxes)  Would anyone care to help?  We want to do 
animal tracks.  Let me know if you are able to help us out.  Thanks a 
bunch in advance.</span></font></div>
