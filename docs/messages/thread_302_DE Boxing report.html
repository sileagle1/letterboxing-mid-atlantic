<div>Miz Scarlet and I were "Red Hat Boxers" today. It's a group for hormonally/chronologically challenged women (read as "Old Broads" over 50 but we "youngsters" scooted in at a mere 45). Anywho, she showed me your PA/MD stamp images (Welcome To Pennsylvania and I forget what the MD thing was). Very nicely done! I'll have to hunt them next time I wonder south of the Mason/Dixon, or thereabouts.</div>

 We have a case of mistaken identity, it was not I but<br/>
Mary from VA who found your PA/MD box.  I did see her<br/>
log book and they are simply lovley stamps and I do<br/>
covet them.  Is this box listed on the LBNA site? I<br/>
consider myself an adventurous boxer, for an old<br/>
broad, an would like to give it a try. I'm am now back<br/>
and forth between Wayne PA and Rehoboth. I'm going to<br/>
get off my butt and plant a few boxes around the area<br/>
this week-end. Next time you are in the area there<br/>
should be some more boxes to find. I'm a little<br/>
intimadated with the skill of some carvers and also<br/>
some people who really write great clues.  My carving<br/>
is improving, i just need to find some more pink<br/>
stuff.<br/>
