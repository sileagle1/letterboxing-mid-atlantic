Basically, you may plant in any of the listed parks given you follow the <br/>
guidelines for planting, which are pretty straight forward.  If a park <br/>
is not listed, you must get written permission in order to plant in the <br/>
park, though it doesn't really tell you how to go about doing that.<br/>

"written permission" is a hyperlink (correct term??) to a form that is<br/>
completed and submitted online.  Or just scroll to bottom of the screen.<br/>
