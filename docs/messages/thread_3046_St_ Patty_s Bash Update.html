are the final details:<br/>
<br/>
I won't have an event stamp for the gathering itself, just been too <br/>
busy, but there will be plenty of surprises and other goodies.<br/>
<br/>
I'll have plenty of food, including home made ice cream.  Please BYOB.  <br/>
So far, the selection I have been getting from folks has looked pretty good.<br/>
<br/>
Party starts at 7, but you can come earlier if you desire.<br/>
<br/>
Directions:<br/>
<br/>
 From I-95:<br/>
Take Exit 41 from 95 for Rt 413.  Turn right at the top of the ramp.<br/>
Move into the left lane, you will pass over Rt. 13 and under a RR bridge.<br/>
Go straight at the light and then veer right at the blinking light (that <br/>
is the tricky part)<br/>
Turn right when you see the sign for Mill Street Parking<br/>
Park in the lot and walk up to Mill Street<br/>
225A is in the middle of the block on the opposite side, look for the <br/>
decorations.<br/>
<br/>
 From the PA Turnpike:<br/>
Take Exit 357, Delaware Valley<br/>
After the tolls, take the ramp for Rt 13 North<br/>
Stay right and turn right at the first light (Green Lane)<br/>
Go all the way to the end and turn right (Radcliffe St)<br/>
Take this all the way to the "Do Not Enter" sign and turn right (Market St.)<br/>
Take the first left and follow down into the lot.<br/>
<br/>
You may find some parking right on Mill Street, but it is usually busy <br/>
Saturday nights.<br/>
<br/>
A clue for those coming:<br/>

Becky and I will enjoy it come Easter.<br/>
<br/>
I think a good time was had by all.  We partied well into the night, <br/>
with plenty of good eats and drinks.  It was great to be able to lure <br/>
some folks down here to Lower Bucks.  I will have to plant some more <br/>
boxes before my eventual departure.<br/>
