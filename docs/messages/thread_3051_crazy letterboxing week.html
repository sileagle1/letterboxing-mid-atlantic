                    <div id="ygrps-yiv-1746260552">After soliciting advice on good letterboxing in the mountains on the other side of the Bay, my friend had to go and have a family visit AND a work crisis, so I did not get the chance to convert her.  We've plans to try again next month, but in the meantime, I made the best of the periodic nice weather this week and done some boxing with just the dogs.<br/>
<br/>It was crazy boxing, though.  Tuesday and Friday we planted boxes near home and learned many valuable lessons.  The first was to look more carefully at the map before deciding to bushwhack.  The second lesson was that swamp mud is cold, stinky, and permanently stains your socks.  Oddly, despite being up to my knees in swamp mud, the interior of my boots stayed dry;  I really don't know how that worked.   The fourth lesson - one that Yuki alone learned - was that it is bad to get too close to sandy cliffs (so if you attempt my Puritan Tiger Beetle box or Washington College box, be careful).  Thankfully the idiot dog falls like a drunk person - completely relaxed - and the cliff was not a very high one.  Also, thankfully, he was at that moment not attached to me or Claire.  My "shortcut" took nearly 2 hours on Tuesday and while it was much more exciting than walking through the corn field, I decided I will stick with the corn field in the future.<br/>
<br/>Friday wasn't too bad, but the ticks were out in force.  Many people think that as an entomologist I should not get the heebiegeebies from ticks, but they are flat out wrong - it just means that I know what type of tick I'm pulling off the dogs and sometimes put them into vials instead of squishing the living daylights out of them and flushing them down the toilet.<br/>
<br/>Today was great fun - went up to Brandywine Creek State Park - and I now understand that thread from this fall about Brandywine.  Geesh, the parks district people in Delaware aren't too good at coming up with names, are they?  But oh what great parks!  Marvelous fun going after Sheba's Into the Woods series.  And one of the best parts about today's letterboxing (to my crazy not-yet-fully-adjusted to being out of Central IL) is that I can go back, easily, to get the rest of the boxes at that park, so I didn't have to rush.  It's only an hour away.  I feel so... spoiled.<br/>
