<div> </div>
<div>I am increasingly frustrated here in the DC/VA/MD area by missing boxes that are not marked as such.  Nor does it help to attract people to the hobby.  </div>
<div> </div>
<div>When the owners are responsive it doesn't matter.  We all have trouble with missing boxes.  I know that boxes are often reported missing when they aren't really.  I know that owners cannot rush out and check them immediately.  </div>
<div> </div>
<div>But some boxes around here I know have been missing for many months or a couple years.  Abandoned by their owners they never get marked.  </div>
<div> </div>
<div>I would be willing to keep a file posted in LBMA's file section of missing reports in the DC/VA/MD area.  It could note a date a box was reported missing, whether confirmed or not, and if it was reported missing multiple times.  Maybe note that the placer has been notified but did not respond.  </div>
<div> </div>
<div>One DC box had been missing for almost two years and continued to attract visiting victims.  I finally asked to adopt it just so I could mark it missing and eventually delete it.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>I am hoping that someday the LbNA web site could have features for this issue much like the geocaching site does now.  </div>

too am frustrated by attempts to locate the owners and reporting <br/>

Would these files have write permission established so that we can <br/>

action tho, probably folks who don't bother to maintain wouldn't <br/>
bother to post either.  However, starting with the LBMA area such a <br/>
database - all members able to edit - could allow for a box to be <br/>
named, seeker ID, date not found.  Since database sorts on first <br/>
column naturally, maybe that should be a State Column.  I'm not sure <br/>
if it then sorts to second column (county?), third column(city?) <br/>
etc.  And I might suggest including a Post# column (LBMA#375 or <br/>
LBusa#44368), that way database data can be kept to a very minimun <br/>
(more lines per screen) and the details could be in a Post.  It is <br/>
quick enough to look up a Post # in the messages.<br/>

Leaping from HnH's comment about double/triple verification, to be <br/>
89.5% sure the box is missing, I would wait until at least 3 boxers <br/>
have reported in on the same box.  <br/>
<br/>
Adds a new perspective to LB'g -- find the box the other guy couldn't <br/>
and then gloat in a post (after updating the database) - if someone <br/>
truly reports the box found then the list moderator can remove <br/>
the "missing" database entries for that one box.<br/>
