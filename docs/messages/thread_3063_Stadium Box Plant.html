There is a box at Brewers Park in Milwaukee but I think it is way out <br/>

I think it is in the adjacent park.<br/>

                    <div id="ygrps-yiv-1934694376">I think that the concerns about how a letterbox might look to the <br/>
uninformed are valid and a good reason for caution.  Members of <br/>
harrier groups have been arrested for marking urban trails with <br/>
flour prior to a run, being taken for toxins or signals for <br/>
assailants.<br/>
<br/>
There is also the practical issue of discovery - how long would the <br/>
box even last, especially in a place that (should) receive regular <br/>
cleaning and is subject to a lot of vibration.<br/>
<br/>
You might be able to do this in a gift shop with permission or you <br/>
could head for the weeds in the parking lot.<br/>
