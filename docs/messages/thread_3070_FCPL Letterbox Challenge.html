Plunge.  As soon as we entered the library, we got a strong, "You are <br/>
strangers and you don't belong" vibe from the staff.<br/>
<br/>
It did not take long to blow up.<br/>
<br/>
With one of the staff watching, I tried to use the catalog computer a <br/>
few times, figured to need that to find the book.  I finally realized <br/>
that the computer was off but hey, Saturday morning, rural area, <br/>
quiet winter day, just hasn't been used yet.<br/>
<br/>
So I turned it on.  Big, big mistake.<br/>
<br/>
The other librarian threw a tantrum that would give reason for <br/>
applause to any 3 year-old in a department store.  She was at least a <br/>
half-century too old to act like she did, but the upshot was that the <br/>
computer was broken and so I might have had some problems with my <br/>
search, which might have inconvenienced me, I suppose - but we really <br/>
had no right to be in the public library in Delmar, being strangers.<br/>
<br/>
I took this tirade with calm and good manners because I did not want <br/>
to be thrown out of the library - came to find the box - or to <br/>
jeopardize the placement.<br/>
<br/>
She then offered us the general Internet computer, but she knew that <br/>
we could not access them because we had no library cards or accounts <br/>
because, yes, we were strangers.<br/>
<br/>
We searched that library for the next 75 minutes (not even close to <br/>
our record for futile library searches) while waiting for Sheriff <br/>
Bubba to show up.  The staff watched us from their little control <br/>
booth.<br/>
<br/>
We finally decided to ask these elite professionals, the <br/>
intelligentia, nay, the illuminati of Delmar (is the sarcasm coming <br/>
through?) so that we could find this box and be done with it.  When <br/>
they learned why we came to their town, they eased up a little and <br/>
pointed to another corner of the library, but we still could not find <br/>
the box.<br/>
<br/>
I emailed the placer, who turned out to be TheDelmarLibrary, a few <br/>
times after we returned to safety and home but received no reply.  <br/>
The box was probably part of a summer reading program and LBNA has <br/>
since moved the listing to the basement.<br/>

I can't speak to the LBs that libraries have placed themselves, but<br/>
the one library series I did that was placed by non-librarians in a<br/>
library was great! The von der Insels made a rainy day a fun day for<br/>
my mom and I, and their "boxes" were really well crafted. <br/>

&gt; &gt; I can't speak to the LBs that libraries have<br/>
&gt; placed themselves, but<br/>
&gt; &gt; the one library series I did that was placed by<br/>
&gt; non-librarians in a<br/>
&gt; &gt; library was great! The von der Insels made a rainy<br/>
&gt; day a fun day for<br/>
&gt; &gt; my mom and I, and their "boxes" were really well<br/>
&gt; crafted. <br/>

&gt; &gt; &gt; We drove to Delmar to get this box on the day<br/>
&gt; before the Polar <br/>
&gt; Bear <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; Plunge.  As soon as we entered the library, we<br/>
&gt; got a strong, "You <br/>
&gt; are <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; strangers and you don't belong" vibe from the<br/>
&gt; staff.<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; It did not take long to blow up.<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; With one of the staff watching, I tried to use<br/>
&gt; the catalog <br/>
&gt; computer a <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; few times, figured to need that to find the<br/>
&gt; book.  I finally <br/>
&gt; realized <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; that the computer was off but hey, Saturday<br/>
&gt; morning, rural area, <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; quiet winter day, just hasn't been used yet.<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; So I turned it on.  Big, big mistake.<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; The other librarian threw a tantrum that would<br/>
&gt; give reason for <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; applause to any 3 year-old in a department<br/>
&gt; store.  She was at <br/>
&gt; least a <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; half-century too old to act like she did, but<br/>
&gt; the upshot was that <br/>
&gt; the <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; computer was broken and so I might have had some<br/>
&gt; problems with my <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; search, which might have inconvenienced me, I<br/>
&gt; suppose - but we <br/>
&gt; really <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; had no right to be in the public library in<br/>
&gt; Delmar, being <br/>
&gt; strangers.<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; I took this tirade with calm and good manners<br/>
&gt; because I did not <br/>
&gt; want <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; to be thrown out of the library - came to find<br/>
&gt; the box - or to <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; jeopardize the placement.<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; She then offered us the general Internet<br/>
&gt; computer, but she knew <br/>
&gt; that <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; we could not access them because we had no<br/>
&gt; library cards or <br/>
&gt; accounts <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; because, yes, we were strangers.<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; We searched that library for the next 75 minutes<br/>
&gt; (not even close <br/>
&gt; to <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; our record for futile library searches) while<br/>
&gt; waiting for Sheriff <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; Bubba to show up.  The staff watched us from<br/>
&gt; their little control <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; booth.<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; We finally decided to ask these elite<br/>
&gt; professionals, the <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; intelligentia, nay, the illuminati of Delmar (is<br/>
&gt; the sarcasm <br/>
&gt; coming <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; through?) so that we could find this box and be<br/>
&gt; done with it.  <br/>
&gt; When <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; they learned why we came to their town, they<br/>
&gt; eased up a little <br/>
&gt; and <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; pointed to another corner of the library, but we<br/>
&gt; still could not <br/>
&gt; find <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; the box.<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; I emailed the placer, who turned out to be<br/>
&gt; TheDelmarLibrary, a <br/>
&gt; few <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; times after we returned to safety and home but<br/>
&gt; received no <br/>
&gt; reply.  <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; The box was probably part of a summer reading<br/>
&gt; program and LBNA <br/>
&gt; has <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; since moved the listing to the basement.<br/>
