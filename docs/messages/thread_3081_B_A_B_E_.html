<div>I agree as well...we are heading down Tuesday; will get to Hot Springs on 
Wednesday. Plan to box locally Thursday &amp; into Asheville on Friday 
to box &amp; have dinner with friends. Thursday nite hoping camp site 
begins to dribble with LBer's so we can enjoy camp fires &amp; exchanges. I, 
too, am hoping to meet many people at camp site &amp; on the trails. I hope 
to meet locals at Event on Saturday who are only coming for the day. </div>
<div>Hope to see you all. We are in a Cabin..if the "BOXERS are on the 
Line"...we're "home", stop by &amp; say Hi!</div>

This is<br/>&gt; something you would need to ask MountainScorpia directly.<br/>&gt; <br/>&gt; Also note that the AQ details state:<br/>&gt; UPDATE MAR 22 2008: There is no set schedule of activities; I promised<br/>&gt; Ranger Darlene there would not be 150 people there all at once.<br/>&gt; <br/>&gt; And there are a lot of boxes (LB.org) for HS NC -- so I would just plan<br/>&gt; on boxing all day and stopping by for a bite to eat.   You'll probably<br/>&gt; meet most attendees on the trails.<br/>&gt; <br/>&gt; ssb<br/>&gt; --- In lbma@yahoogroups.com, June  McAllister nfmoon@ wrote:<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; This is listed on AQ as a one day event beginning at 10am on Sat.,<br/>&gt; 4/26 and ending at 6pm on 4/26. People are told there are campgounds<br/>&gt; nearby for people to camp, cabins, etc. There are 150 people signed up.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; The event planner is saying that there are *10 parking spaces* at the<br/>&gt; two pavillions where the actual gathering is held. She is also telling<br/>&gt; me that she thinks that most of the exchanges and "what not" (her words)<br/>&gt; will be done at the *campground* over the *whole* weekend.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Is it a one day event or is it a weekend event? When I go to a one day<br/>&gt; event, I expect that I will be able to take part in all that event has<br/>&gt; to offer on that one day, between those hours.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Any comments?<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; missmoon<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>

OK, so it is only a few hundred feet at a time, but still . . . <br/>
<br/>
A forest fire was started last nite and the vehicle traffic next to the <br/>
camp--even running on the train tracks (that's a site)--was heavy.  <br/>
This AM the helicopters were dropping water on the scene.  Would have <br/>
been interesting to see them scoop up the water (from the French <br/>
Broad??)<br/>
<br/>
Needless to say the area needs rain . . . and T Storms are still <br/>
scheduled to start to nite.<br/>
<br/>
So I better get back to hunting tupperware<br/>
