<br/>
Straight Line : MidnightBoxer  on Feb 29  (65)  wins 1 Pink Slab<br/>
<br/>
4corners &amp; Middle :  LightninBug on March 18 (121)  wins 1 Pink slab<br/>
<br/>
Big "X" :  LightninBug on  March 19 (124)  wins 2 Pink slabs<br/>
<br/>
Perimeter :  Psychiker on March 20 (129)  wins 3 Pink slabs<br/>
<br/>
100% : on March 22 (142) 4Suits - just under the wire takes home 3 Pink<br/>
slabs,  while Psychiker was 1st to call and only gets the glory.<br/>
<br/>
Now you all just have to find me at a gather to collect!!  Then you need<br/>
to carve and plant and email me the box name after it is posted to<br/>
LB.org -- so next year it can be included on the list of choices.<br/>
<br/>
I'll definitely be at CELEBRATE - another Camp'n' Stamp'n' 2008 on May<br/>
30 - Jun 1 Tuckahoe SP near Denton MD.  Will you!<br/>
<br/>
Thanks to everyone who played, I hope there is more competition next<br/>
year!  There certainly won't be as many (unvisited?) un-choosen boxes in<br/>
such far away locations as Virginia (LB you need to get out more!)<br/>

<div>What a fun time I had! Thank you so much for hosting. I actually did this 
same thing with my Cub Scouts starting in February. We ended 3 days before 
TRAIL! We only had 40 choices, though. All had a grand time &amp; want to play 
again. </div>
<div>Thank you so much for the wonderful idea &amp; the great time. Do I owe you 
a dollar for playing? Will settle up at BABE if you are going.</div>

<div>Congrats to all the winners!</div>
