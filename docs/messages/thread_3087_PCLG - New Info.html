recently offered to let me adopt all of the PCLG boxes. As many know, <br/>
PCLG developed some great clues but as a whole has been out of boxing <br/>
for awhile. Brian has basically been 'holding the keys to the store'. <br/>
His offer to me was a great gesture that I was glad to accept. I will <br/>
shortly start to update the clues on LBNA of the boxes that are known <br/>
to remain and will be reviewing the missing boxes to see which ones I <br/>
may revive. A couple of long time boxers have previouly 'adopted' some <br/>
PCLG clues to keep them alive. I will be reaching out to them, but just <br/>
so it is clear; I have no intention of asking anyone to 'give up' their <br/>
adopted boxes. You went through the trouble of keeping them alive and <br/>
Brian appreciated the effort-and I certainly do as well. I'm glad that <br/>
others felt the same desire to keep them alive that I do. I would like <br/>
to hear from anyone who has found PCLG boxes that are listed as <br/>
missing. I've heard that some boxers have found remnants of 'missing' <br/>
boxes (like I have) and if there is anything worthwhile left to look <br/>
at, I would like to see them if possible. I look forward to keeping the <br/>
legacy of these boxes alive and as such, any boxes that I maintain will <br/>
reference their PCLG history.  -John</div>
