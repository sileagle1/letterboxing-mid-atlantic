&gt; Come to one of the largest and most beautiful state parks in PA to <br/>
test<br/>
&gt; out your map skills, and find some wonderful stamps.  Boxes will be<br/>
&gt; planted near controls along the permanent orienteering course at <br/>
Hickory<br/>
&gt; Run.  You'll need to get a park orienteering map (we're still <br/>
working<br/>
&gt; out details on that), and simple clues will lead you from the <br/>
controls<br/>
&gt; to the boxes.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; The pavilion at the Sand Spring Lake has been rented.  We'll gather<br/>
&gt; there.  The orienteering course is a short drive away from there.  <br/>
The<br/>
&gt; plan for lunch will be pot luck.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Here's the really fun part:  All boxes will be themed around the <br/>
Coen<br/>
&gt; Brothers' movie O Brother, Where Art Thou?  As I recall, the <br/>
possibility<br/>
&gt; of a gathering based around that movie had some traction in the <br/>
past. <br/>
&gt; I've already got some ideas for stamps, but we would love to get <br/>
stamps<br/>
&gt; from many different people.  If you'd like to carve a stamp for it,<br/>
&gt; email me off list.  I'll need all stamps by the end of May.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; That's about it for now.  Watch for more info.  There should be an <br/>
Atlas<br/>
&gt; Quest event page up in the near future.<br/>

Due to the cost of color copying, maps and clues will only be <br/>
provided to those who sign up on AQ or RSVP directly to Mike or <br/>
myself.<br/>
<br/>
It will be as much fun, in an even prettier locale, than French <br/>

    clues will lead you from the controls to the boxes.<br/><br/>The pavilion at 
    the Sand Spring Lake has been rented.  We'll gather there.  The 
    orienteering course is a short drive away from there.  The plan for 
    lunch will be pot luck.<br/><br/>Here's the really fun part:  All boxes 
    will be themed around the Coen Brothers' movie <i>O Brother, Where Art 
    Thou?</i>  As I recall, the possibility of a gathering based around 
    that movie had some traction in the past.  I've already got some ideas 
    for stamps, but we would love to get stamps from many different 
    people.  If you'd like to carve a stamp for it, email me off

    for now.  Watch for more info.  There should be an Atlas Quest

</span></blockquote>Hickory Run actually has three different courses on its orienteering <br/>
brochure. One beginner, one intermediate, and one advanced. The <br/>
French Creek course (the one Alienteering uses) is a beginner course. <br/>
So it depends on which course the placer chooses to use. <br/>
<br/>
Mapsurfer #10 uses the advanced orienteering course at Hickory Run <br/>
for its clue and it is legitamitely advanced. I am fairly experienced <br/>
in orienteering and I got misplaced a couple of times. I don't <br/>
remember my exact time to complete the course (I may have written it <br/>
in the log book), but I remember it being quite poor.<br/>
<br/>
I don't have the brochure in front of me, but I recall that the <br/>
beginner course was just as straight forward as the one at French <br/>
Creek, and the intermediate course was at the easier end of what <br/>
would be considered intermediate.<br/>

Your milage may vary.<br/>
