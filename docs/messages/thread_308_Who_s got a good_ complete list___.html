<div> </div>
<div>This is a great Topic of the Week. We did the "What's in your Pack" thing a few months agao, but I don't recall doing the "What's in your box" thing yet. Since I now have 60, count 'em, 60 finds since 1/04 (woo-hoo!) I have seen a few boxes! And they are all different and unique. </div>
<div> </div>
<div>Some folks put a lot of effort into the logs, we do not. Our's are your basic 3x5 card sprial box, 2 for $1 at the $1 store. I was very impressed with the Raindears sawed in half versions, and impressed with the determination it takes to do that! All of the hand made logs I have seen are wonderful but I am not the artsy craftsy type so don't go lookin' for art in my box. Oooh, just got an idea for a box, will tell Carvin Carmen later if I can retain the thought.<br/></div>
<div>Many folks put a lot of effort into thier stamps, again whatever your "thing" is.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Lot's of folks like to include, and get, first finders certificate's or tokens. The closest I came was in my Dead boxes I put some Dead stickers I had laying around the house. For my kids series Judy B. sent me the cutest stickers which I will include in the last box.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>I label all of my boxes with the name, a "please carefully rehide" admonition and my email address. Was using my ph#  til I read here that's kinda of a dumb thing to do. I get a kick out of Silent Doug's "Official Letterbox" label. Is there such a thing? I keep meaning to ask him, perhaps it's a box that he has gotten permission for? Anyway, most folks label in some manner.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>And I always include take away sheets for any non-boxers who come across the box by accident. My first box was found by accident. It was Team Kelly's Purple Coffin which was missing everything but the box, and the take away sheets. I took one home, logged onto the website and was sucked into this world never to fully return to outside world again...Everything I see, hear, read or think about reminds me of a great idea for a box. </div>

HnH covered the basics, and to keep the box small enough to hide - <br/>
basics are all you need; except she forgot the ziplock baggies - on <br/>
everything!  And lately it is has suggested to label (Sharpie) them <br/>
with what goes into which bag.  If you are writing on the plastic box <br/>
you may want to use a paint pen rather than a Sharpie (they fade in <br/>
time, especially if the box is left exposed out in the open . . . oh <br/>
that's the LB-usa gripe line, sorry.)<br/>
<br/>
Personally, I like to make letterboxing a learning experience so I <br/>
include (taped to the inside box cover) some information about the <br/>
stamp. . . literally the stamp, as mine are all themed to postage <br/>
stamps.  <br/>
<br/>
Some folks include an ink pad, but I like multi-colored stamping, so <br/>
I list in my clues which color pens to bring along --- or just bring <br/>
an ink pad period.<br/>
<br/>
Now as for micros, letterbooks, PLBs, they all involve something <br/>
different.  Of course the more boxes you find the more you'll see <br/>
what works and what doesn't.<br/>

</span></blockquote>Geocaching.com sells an "official geocache" sticker:<br/>
<a href="http://shop.groundspeak.com/productDetail.cfm?CategoryID=4&amp;ProductID=59" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://shop.groundspeak.com/productDetail.cfm?CategoryID=4&amp;ProductID=59</a><br/>
<br/>
PA State Parks give these for free to "registered" geocaches in its parks, FYI.<br/>
<br/>
I've seen geocaches and letterboxes labeled "official game piece" or <br/>
"official letterbox," so I decided to give it a try and write the same in <br/>
permanent marker on the outside of my letterboxes. The idea is that the <br/>
noxers might then leave it alone -- not necessarily that parks officials <br/>
have somehow "approved" of the box.<br/>
<br/>
Borrowing the idea, I also made up some official letterbox stickers:<br/>
<a href="http://www.cafepress.com/letterboxing.10589555" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.cafepress.com/letterboxing.10589555</a><br/>
to see if that helps stem the tide of disappearing letterboxes.<br/>
<br/>
As for what constitutes "official," as far as I'm concerned, *all* <br/>
letterboxes are official!<br/>
<br/>
I'm not sure if any of these work, but they can't hurt, i figure....<br/>
