                    <div id="ygrps-yiv-907278209">Oh, the idea of having boxes as close as 15 miles away - you have no idea how wonderful that sounds.  If I only boxed that close to me, I'd never box.<br/><br/>Before I moved, I definitely had favorite placers whose boxes I would eagerly anticipate;  I haven't found enough letterboxes here to develop a sense yet of who has really awesome hikes and who doesn't.  <br/>
<br/>Mostly I have two methods for choosing letterboxes.  The first is to find boxes along a travel route.  So, for instance, when I lived in Illinois and would be driving to Michigan or NY to see family, I would find clues for letterboxes at a nice stopping point along the way.  We found some really nice parks this way and it is always good to get out of the car and move around a bit.  The second method is if I'm home with nothing planned for the weekend, I find clues for those boxes closest to home - which currently means about a 45 minute drive.   Then I select for maximum bang for my buck - or the presence of multiple boxes in one location, preferably with multiple planters. <br/>
<br/>Once I've selected an area, that's when I get choosy.  I generally don't go after boxes if I know the stamp is store-bought (what can I say, I'm a snob - hand carved are so much more interesting to me, even the really crude ones).  I don't tend to go after urban or drive-by boxes because they aren't nearly as much fun for the dogs and if I don't bring the dogs, I have to carry stuff myself.  I prefer hikes of a decent length, or at least the option to keep hiking in that area after I've found the box.  And now that I bought myself a season pass for DE state parks, I'll probably show a marked preference for boxes in those parks :)<br/>

that I may never find all my local ones!  I stick close to home, unless we <br/>
are going somewhere anyway.  But then, I bring the clues and end up running <br/>
out of time to look for the boxes!  The last time I took clues and actually <br/>
used them on a family vacation, we almost missed our train!<br/>
