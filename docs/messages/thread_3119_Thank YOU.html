For those that don't know my Dad had a knee replacement and is <br/>
currently recovering from that surgery. Although he is almost 75 and <br/>
Mom 73 they Love Letterboxing and have done some amazing hikes in all <br/>
50 states! And met some amazing people. Dad is a little frustrate <br/>
because he wants to be back out hiking. I have been calling every day <br/>
for updates and to cheer him up.<br/>
<br/>
He told me tonight about the lovely card from the LBMA people! Thank <br/>
you to the all who participated and sent this to him, you don't know <br/>
how much it means. To both of us. You have touch my heart.<br/>
<br/>
