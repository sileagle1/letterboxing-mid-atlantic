the 1980s, The park tree crews &amp; Rangers have offices here now. The <br/>
hilltop is used for equine &amp; other recreation. No horses live here <br/>
now. But I see horses &amp; dogs on most visits.<br/>

Robert Ryerss was President of SPCA &amp; the Ryerss Infirmary. The SPCA <br/>
placed many water troughs for horses around the city, they were stone <br/>
&amp; engraved with the words " A kind man is kind to his animal". <br/>
The Ryerss Farm is a retirement home for older &amp; rescued horses now <br/>
in Chester County, it moved from this area in 1955. Link: <br/>

The Park boundary to the NE is Meeting House Rd. (dirt). The Ryerss <br/>
Infirmary extended NE from that Rd. to Corner of Bloomfield Ave. &amp; <br/>
Verree Rd. It was over 200 acres. It is full of 1950's homes now.<br/>
You should look under (in) a water trough for a magnetic letter box. <br/>
Rehide in shadow with camouflage facing out.<br/>
On leaving you should check out the Krewstown Road House Built <br/>
between 1730 and 1750, this house is an excellent example of rural <br/>
colonial architecture and one of the oldest documented residences. To <br/>
the NE on Krewstown Rd. is the 300+ year old Baptist Meeting House &amp; <br/>
Cemetery.<br/>
To the S. of Krestown Rd. is Pennypack Creek in the park, with <br/>
parking &amp; scenic views of 2 historic bridges, one 90 feet high. Enjoy.<br/>
