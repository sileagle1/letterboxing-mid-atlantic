Got out a ways from NOVA and found a few boxes in the VA beach area this weekend.  I <br/>
highly recommend the SOS box down at VA Beach its really cool!  And the highlight of the <br/>
boxing finds this past weekend was... drum roll... the "Atlantic Mermaid" she is beautiful.  <br/>
Happy Boxing<br/>

Well, at least I know now it isn't broken.<br/>

And folks can share they boxed this weekend.<br/>

This past weekend was indeed a good weekend.  Without it being focused <br/>
on boxing we still managed to get 17, and not all were drive-bys.  SOS <br/>
has a great clue, and the Atlantic Ocean Mermaid is well worth figuring <br/>
out, great stamp.  Certainly my favorites of the bunch.<br/>

Did manage to take a little hike up Mt. Misery to blow<br/>
out the cob webs. Checked boxes as I went, all are<br/>
fine. The Spor for the Valley Forge box is getting out<br/>
of control and even with all those rocks the last<br/>
finder left it exposed. <br/>
