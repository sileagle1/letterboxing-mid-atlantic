<br/>
I was over at Washington Crossing State Park today, and unfortunately <br/>
the sites that were booked for the gathering's weekend are now confirmed <br/>
and paid for, so there will be no camping at the park.<br/>
<br/>
However;<br/>
<br/>
I talked to Mark (PM Jets) over there about it, and about the idea of <br/>
camping just up the river at Bull's Island, and the fact that they <br/>
needed two nights to reserve a site.  He made a call over to a friend at <br/>
the park, and they said they may be able to reserve two sites, possibly <br/>
together, just for Saturday night.  They will get back to me on this <br/>
very soon.  So there may be camping after all!<br/>
<br/>
In other news, and this is the bad news park, as you know WCSP is one of <br/>
the park on the list for cuts.  Mark's job will be cut if the Corzine's <br/>
plan to cut the parks go through.  If you are in the area of any of the <br/>
state parks in Joisey, please stop by and sign the petition there to <br/>
keep these parks open and operating.  The parks are very kind to <br/>
letterboxers on the other side of the Great Divide, and they allow us to <br/>
plant pretty much at will, with a few reasonable exceptions.  So please <br/>
help out.<br/>
<br/>
Also, there will be a rally at the capitol in Trenton on April 23, noon <br/>
to two.  If you are free, please come out and show your support.<br/>

<br/>
Thanks to Nathan for putting out the word about the closings and my possible layoff. Please attend the rally on the 23rd if you can. Do not pay attention to the current news that says parks will be saved, At this point they are still planning on cutting staff. <br/>
