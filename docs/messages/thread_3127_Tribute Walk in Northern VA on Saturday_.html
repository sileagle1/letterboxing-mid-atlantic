April 16, a twentyfour year old Prince William Co fire fighter was <br/>
killed in the line of duty. The same morning, Kyle Wilson had entered a <br/>
burning house trying to rescue a family of seven that had actually <br/>
already escaped and was watching from the neighbor's house. The burning <br/>
house collapsed on Kyle. <br/>
<br/>
In tribute the 1st Annual Wilson Walk for Fitness 10K will be held in <br/>
Prince William County on Saturday.<br/>
