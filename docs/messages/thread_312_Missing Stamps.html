The problem with geocaching is the GPS takes you to the general area <br/>
and then you have to look all over for the cache.  If there is a <br/>
letterbox in the vicinity it may likely be found.  I wouldn't say it <br/>
happens often that stamps go missing like that but it is worth <br/>
checking.  <br/>
