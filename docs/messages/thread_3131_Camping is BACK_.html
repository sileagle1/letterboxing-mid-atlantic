basis, so get in now!<br/>
<br/>
Right now I have two sites reserved for May 17 at Bulls Island <br/>
Recreation Area.  The sites are #57 and 58.  Many thanks go to Mark (PM <br/>
JETS) for arranging this.<br/>
<br/>
Bulls Island is about 25 minutes up river from Washington Crossing State <br/>
Park, right on Rt 29.<br/>
<br/>
I just spoke to the park, and they, at the moment, have a bunch of other <br/>
sites available, however, if you wish to reserve you must reserve for <br/>
two nights.  If you pull in that day you may be able to get a site, but <br/>
there is no guarantee that you will find an open site.<br/>
<br/>
Everyone is invited to make their way up to the campground for a <br/>
campfire and night boxing if they would like.  Visitors will have to <br/>
park in the overflow lot near the park entrance (don't worry, it is a <br/>
small park).<br/>
<br/>
I figure the gathering is going to wrap up at about 4PM, and I will head <br/>
up to the camp at that time.<br/>
<br/>
For dinner, folks will be on their own, but New Hope is not far away, <br/>
and you know how much fun that can be ;-)<br/>
<br/>
I hope folks are interested.  I like to present a camping element, and <br/>
am glade to get something together this time.<br/>
