As a newbie, I would love to ask your advice on a few things....<br/>
<br/>
1- I found my first HH. It does not have an email address to notify<br/>
the owner nor does it have a log on the lbNA website. Is there<br/>
anything that I should do before dropping it off in a new home?<br/>
<br/>
2- Ticks are out in full force this past weekend in PA. We found 3 of<br/>
them on us. What are good methods of preventing them? Any suggestions<br/>
would be greatly appreciated.<br/>
<br/>
thanks!!<br/>

repellant!  Do not use citronella-based repellants because they only have a <br/>
useful life of 12 minutes, according to our family doctor.<br/>
<br/>
But, make sure to leave the bug repellant at home if you go to New Castle, <br/>
Delaware because there are no mosquitoes or ticks around those boxes, but <br/>
the biting flies are attracted to it like BBQ sauce.<br/>

it.  Just stamp in and release it to a new home.<br/>

</span></blockquote>Generally ticks get on you by dropping from the trees above you or <br/>
hopping a ride from bushes you pass.<br/>
<br/>
Wear long pants, sturdy shoes and socks.  Tuck your pants inside your <br/>
socks.  Also, wear a wide brimmed hat.  Wear light colored clothing so <br/>
you can more easily spot them when they get on you.<br/>
