Last summer or maybe 2 summers ago, there was a woman jogging along<br/>
the Henry Hudson Trail (not very desolate, right?) in Keyport/Union<br/>
Beach and was approached by a loony that exposed himself. Ironically,<br/>
she was a police officer! Ha! <br/>
and B) I was on Bayonet Farm today, and some guy suggested I carry<br/>
mace because there are coyotes out there, and some looney toons can be<br/>
found on any given secluded hiking trail.<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, how do I get my hands on some mace or pepperspray?<br/>

bit wary of walking alone in city and suburban parks. I carry a cell<br/>
phone, whistle and sometimes pepper spray. I have been assaulted, but<br/>
never while letterboxing. Standard rule, the further away from people<br/>
that you are, the fewer people there are to bother you. I've hiked for<br/>
hours in the woods and rarely run into another person. No people, no<br/>
problem. Day hiking in state parks has never been a problem.<br/>
<br/>
Read about the area where you are going to letterbox. Has there been a<br/>
rape/assault in the area? Is a serial rapist lurking? Go somewhere else.<br/>
<br/>
Keep your eyes and ears open, use your common sense, play it safe and<br/>
you should be fine.<br/>

Later the same day, this boxer went after another one of my boxes in another larger county park and saw in the parking lot-- you guessed it-- the selfsame cops he had met before.  He immediately turned his car around and left.....<br/>

                    <div id="ygrps-yiv-345615775">I do know people who "pack" when they letterbox and hike.  Don from CA <br/>
does, cougars are an issue in this area.  Chuck from CT packs and did <br/>
shoot a coyote who attacked his precious dog Molly while on a hike.<br/>
<br/>
There used to be a woman in TX who packed when letterboxing.  She'd go <br/>
hiking in flip flops, but made sure she had a loaded pistol that she <br/>
kept under the blanket which was under her toddler in his wagon.<br/>
<br/>
Never understood that last one...<br/>
<br/>
I carry hiking poles and nothing else except a whistle and a cell phone <br/>
which are more if I get injured than a form of protection.<br/>
<br/>
If you don't feel comfortable hiking in for a box, listen to your gut <br/>
feelings--they are there for a reason.<br/>

&gt; Anyone go letterboxing alone? Has anyone ever run into any trouble? I<br/>
&gt; was wondering if it is legal in NJ to carry some form of self-defense,<br/>
&gt; like mace? Do you know?<br/>
