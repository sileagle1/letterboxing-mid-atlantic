<br/>
Only 4 weeks until we'll be in the Mid-Atlantic area!  We're flying <br/>
into Philadelphia late on May 21 and hope to do lots of hiking &amp; <br/>
boxing during the 5 days we're there.  <br/>
<br/>
As many of you know, we like to find some challenging hikes and/or <br/>
areas such as a large park where we can hike all day without doing a <br/>
lot of driving around.  We're just starting to do some research and <br/>
are thinking we'll probably stay in the area north of Philly, maybe <br/>
into NJ and the southern part of NY.<br/>
<br/>
It's been 3 years since we were last in the area.  During our <br/>
previous trip we did a lot of Battle of the Band boxes, Mt. Minsi, <br/>
The Dr. Who series, Pulpit Rock, Nolde Forest, a funny B&amp;E dog <br/>
series, and many others.<br/>
<br/>
We're hoping some of you might be able to give us some <br/>
recommendations for some good hiking spots to hunt for either your <br/>
own boxes or others.  You can contact us off-list if you'd like.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks!<br/>

<br/>
A lot has been added over the past 3 yrs.  Many longer hikes can be <br/>
had in French Creek (if you plan it out right, you can find 20+ <br/>
boxes and hike 20 mile), Middle Creek (where I hope to join you) and <br/>
even the AT and of course all of the new stuff up at Pulpit Rock.  <br/>
The DWG has some newer stuff on the Joisey side and may conceal some <br/>
mysteries.  South Mountain will be getting some new stuff for a <br/>
quick blitz in Allentown as well.<br/>
<br/>
Indigo Vulture has been busy up in the Scranton Wilkes-Barre area <br/>
and I think there are some leg stretchers there.<br/>
<br/>
"No drive by's for you!"<br/>

oh, I mean....  LB<br/>
