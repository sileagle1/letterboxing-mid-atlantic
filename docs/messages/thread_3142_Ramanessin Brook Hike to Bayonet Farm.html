I met a lot of happy hikers today. It was an organized hike from<br/>
Holmdel Park to Bayonet Farm, along the Ramanessin Brook. Anyone here<br/>
ever take that trail? It was really beautiful. I was wondering if any<br/>
of the hikers I met, happen to be letterboxers as well!</div>

                    <div id="ygrps-yiv-1576379666">I wasn't there, but I did spend Saturday with my noxer<br/>
husband at Codorus State Park in PA, and it was a<br/>
great day of boxing.  We also saw a beautiful box<br/>
turtle, 4 sets of Canada geese parents with their<br/>
oh-so-cute goslings, and only six ticks between us. <br/>
Five on my husband...the tick magnet.<br/>
<br/>
But my favorite critter was when I set aside a bunch<br/>
of old sticks off a box at the base of a tree, then<br/>
lifted the box up, and there staring at me, wondering<br/>
what just happened to his roof, was a little deer<br/>
mouse.  He froze for ten seconds, then scampered off. <br/>
The box had been untouched all winter...I was sorry to<br/>
disturb his Tupperware-roofed home!<br/>
<br/>
The best box for me was one that we had the most<br/>
trouble with.  We had puzzled and puzzled over<br/>
matching the terrain to the clues, and my sweet noxer<br/>
was ready to move on.  In deference to marital harmony<br/>
I acquiesced, but...oh well, you know that *I* would<br/>
have been happy to backtrack a mile and try it all<br/>
over again!  However, the very next box we looked for<br/>
happened to circle us RIGHT BACK to the troublesome<br/>
place, and with renewed vigor [and absent the pesky<br/>
fishermen] we gave it one more try, and VOILA!  right<br/>
where my beloved noxer said it absolutely wasn't. Tee<br/>
hee hee.  Oh, those suspiciously laid piles of<br/>
sticks...<br/>
