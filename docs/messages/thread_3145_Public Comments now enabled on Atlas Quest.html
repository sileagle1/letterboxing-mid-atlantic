<div>Well I thought I had opted out of havnig my boxes rated until I got an 
  email from an AQ'er chastising me about one of my plants and telling me that's 
  why he only gave it a "2" rating. Um.....it was his 2nd box. I thought I had 
  opted out of that but lo and behold I hadn't.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>At this point I am leaning more towards just pulling them from AQ, too 
  many things I have to "opt out" of. Think it';s easier to just "opt out" 
  completely.<br/><br/><b><i>June McAllister

"outdoor puzzles" or "treasureboxing", and leave<br/>
"letterboxing" to AQ, for all we care).  Semiotics does matter,<br/>

"letterboxing" for what AQ isn't because that's the symbols<br/>

&gt; I don't know all that much about AQ (and as such,<br/>
&gt; perhaps<br/>
&gt; I should hold my tongue), but from what I've read<br/>
&gt; recently<br/>
&gt; (and in the past), it seems quite out of the spirit<br/>
&gt; of<br/>
&gt; "letterboxing" (whatever that means).  Perhaps what<br/>
&gt; AQ is<br/>
&gt; should be called something else, or perhaps we<br/>
&gt; should call<br/>
&gt; something that isn't really AQ'ish something else<br/>
&gt; (like<br/>
&gt; "outdoor puzzles" or "treasureboxing", and leave<br/>
&gt; "letterboxing" to AQ, for all we care).  Semiotics<br/>
&gt; does matter,<br/>
&gt; I'm afraid.  Recent events prove it.  Y'all can bash<br/>
&gt; me<br/>
&gt; for the "S" word, but words do matter.  We only like<br/>
&gt; "letterboxing" for what AQ isn't because that's the<br/>
&gt; symbols<br/>
&gt; the good ol' folks across the pond use.  But<br/>
&gt; whatever.<br/>
&gt; We happen to think those who change should choose<br/>
&gt; different<br/>
&gt; symbols, but are content to choose our own if they<br/>
&gt; haven't<br/>
&gt; such grace.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; And trust me, my comments are not motivated by envy.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt;  &gt; not that it has been foisted on you and you have<br/>
&gt; to<br/>
&gt;  &gt; choose not to have it.<br/>

want you to plant boxes for me to find but I don't want the ill-<br/>
defined "too many" of anything, so that requires the "right amount" <br/>
of the "right" information.  I want creativity and innovation but I <br/>
also want things to stay the same.  I want to attend gatherings with <br/>
really cool folks without the risk that they will start as F-10 <br/>
experts on everything.<br/>
<br/>
It seems as though the skills and attitudes that go into <br/>
letterboxing - the sense of adventure, the observation and social <br/>
abilities, and the wild imagination - ought to make it possible for <br/>
us to continue to enjoy it.<br/>
<br/>
Ehh, that's what I think, anyway.  Any comments on our boxes are <br/>
moderated for the time being.<br/>

Perhaps<br/>&gt; what<br/>&gt; &gt; AQ is<br/>&gt; &gt; should be called something else, or perhaps we<br/>&gt; &gt; should call<br/>&gt; &gt; something that isn't really AQ'ish something<br/>&gt; else<br/>&gt; &gt; (like<br/>&gt; &gt; "outdoor puzzles" or "treasureboxing" , and leave<br/>&gt; &gt; "letterboxing" to AQ, for all we
 care).<br/>&gt; Semiotics<br/>&gt; &gt; does matter,<br/>&gt; &gt; I'm afraid. Recent events prove it. Y'all can<br/>&gt; bash<br/>&gt; &gt; me<br/>&gt; &gt; for the "S" word, but words do matter. We only<br/>&gt; like<br/>&gt; &gt; "letterboxing" for what AQ isn't because that's<br/>&gt; the<br/>&gt; &gt; symbols<br/>&gt; &gt; the good ol' folks across the pond use.

the Will of Landru?  See the text below which I "borrowed" :) and <br/>
added text in parenthesis( )for relevance....a bit of whimsy.....does <br/>
this sound familiar??  Will it play out in this manner?  You <br/>
decide.. :)<br/>
<br/>
***Plot Summary: While visiting Beta III (Atlas Quest), where the <br/>
starship Archon (Traditional Letterboxing) disappeared a century ago<br/>
(awhile ago), the crew (letterboxers)discovers a rigid and regimented <br/>
society (AQ?)that becomes completely lawless and uncontrollable <br/>
during a periodic Festival(Ryan's Florida thru-hike), which Kirk<br/>
(Randy) and a landing party(Hairyleggers) witness. As soon as <br/>
Festival ends, the people become passive once again(when Ryan <br/>
returns). The society is governed by robed Lawgivers(moderators) who <br/>
enforce the will of Landru(Ryan?), a godlike being who can control <br/>
the people and make himself appear anywhere(He appears all over AQ). <br/>
Landru sends energy beams(blogs) to try to destroy the Enterprise<br/>
(LBNA), as he destroyed the Archon before, and tries to assimilate <br/>
Kirk's crew into "The Body(AQ family)", as the unified populace is <br/>
called. Kirk(Randy) and Spock(LB) are spared by an underground network<br/>
(LBNA'ers) and confront Landru directly, discovering that "he"(Ryan) <br/>
is actually a computer(AQ server) storing the memories of the <br/>
original Landru and controlling the people of Beta III. When Kirk<br/>
(Randy) insists that in doing so, the computer has harmed the <br/>
population(all letterboxers) it has been charged to protect, the <br/>
machine(AQ) self-destructs and the people recover free will...<br/>

happen piecemeal (just check how many boxes there are).  I have a <br/>
lot of clue texts to move to my own website (ala Mapsurfer or Indigo <br/>
Vulture, but not as techy).  Most of the unique or eevil clues are <br/>
already there as .pdf files.  At some point, the only way to access <br/>
the clues will be through LBNA.<br/>

I do not believe in restrictions to access to the clues we write <br/>
(sorry, not an exclusionary elitist), just will ultimately be <br/>
mitigating one means of access that has become geocaching.com.<br/>

I have had a number of conversations with Ryan in the past and I <br/>
agree he seems like a good guy.  I'm kind of on the fence about AQ <br/>
right now.  I'm not crazy about the direction the site is heading but <br/>
I still like some aspects of it.  Obviously, LBNA and AQ are not the <br/>
same.  LBNA is more of a "hands off approach" - where the clues are <br/>
posted there and that's about it.  ..Which is why we migrate to Yahoo <br/>
for chatboards.  Personally, I believe it should stay that way.  <br/>
Since AQ is an actively managed "hands on approach" it is more <br/>
diverse in it's offerings and it is also open to many <br/>
people "injecting" their opinions into how they feel the site should <br/>
be run.  Obvioulsy, not everyone will agree...and that can often lead <br/>
to changes over time as "new blood" comes in with ideas that often <br/>
push the "old dead wood" (that would be us) to the side.  Speaking of <br/>
old dead wood.....I will be heading out shortly to look for one <br/>
particular piece of dead wood that is said to be hiding a treasure of <br/>
old...  I hope to come back with more than splinters  :)</div>

<br/>
What good is AQ with a giant gaping dearth of clues in the MidAtlantic?  Vote with your <br/>
feet.<br/>
<br/>
I thought part of the beauty of letterboxing was its ill-defined nature.  British in origin but <br/>
thoroughly American.  No international governing body.  It is a growing living evolving <br/>
thing.  So some people like hikes and some people like postal and some people like the <br/>
computer and some people want clues written on lamb flesh.  So what?  Follow your bliss.  <br/>
It's a la carte.  Take what you want and leave the rest.<br/>
Can't it all be letterboxing?  Do we need a "pure" definition?  Fusion or Dixieland, its all <br/>
Jazz.<br/>

this issue would have exploded on the big list, and not here, but it is <br/>
interesting to hear other's comments on it.<br/>
<br/>
I am not going to totally defend Ryan on this one.  I have no problem <br/>
with the comments, I can moderate them and if anything is too reveling I <br/>
can just not let them be posted.  I do think his execution of this <br/>
change has been piss poor.  While, yes, it is his website, he seems to <br/>
take no interest in what others have to say before opening that box, and <br/>
once he does there is not real going back.  Fortunately, he will at <br/>
least try to correct things.<br/>
<br/>
Back to the public comments thing; I think there is one question one has <br/>
to ask before they start removing boxes and bashing the system.  How <br/>
does this really effect the box?  I mean, really, if you can moderate <br/>
what is posted publicly, how does this really change what is fundamental <br/>
to the game, the letterbox itself?  Is it really that important in the <br/>
long run?  What is more important, what people have to say about it, or <br/>
is it about the clue, the hike, the stamp, the location, or the <br/>
company?  I think all of those and more are far more important then what <br/>
someone has to say.  Keep them true to yourself and everything else will <br/>
fall into place.<br/>
<br/>
Further, how many bad comments do you really get?  When it comes down to <br/>
it, when I look at those who actually go looking for my boxes, which are <br/>
actually just a few people, and the comments I get, the good feedback <br/>
far, far exceeds the bad.  I just brush off the bad.  No matter where <br/>
you post clues, you are going to get bad feedback on a box, be it on AQ, <br/>
Letterboxing.org, or your own site.  Heck, Becky and I found a box a few <br/>
weeks ago in the Smokies where one person complained about the box being <br/>
in a National Park in the logbook.  You just can't please everybody.<br/>
<br/>
As for the other crap, and yes, those things are crap, like the LBC, <br/>
virtual, ect., well, I have spoken of it before, just not as publicly:<br/>
<br/>
<a href="http://www.penncoasters.com/aq.htm" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.penncoasters.com/aq.htm</a><br/>
<br/>
Thing is, and what it comes down to, is letterboxing is still what you <br/>
make of it.  If you want hard clues, they are there along with the easy <br/>
ones.  If you want to plant someplace, you usually can, so long as you <br/>
accept the consequences.  It is still up to you, there are still no <br/>
rules beyond my favorite mantra of "Do No Harm."<br/>

<br/>I don't have a problem with enabling comments;  I've put my boxes on moderation just to see what happens, but I do have a problem with the comments being the default option.  Particularly when the change has not been all that obviously or well-announced.  But as H&amp;H said, I'll be sticking with AQ for a little while longer because I do like some of the features - like events and the search by travel route option.  The day AQ gets Superpoke, though, I'm outta there.<br/>

It is easy enough to look them up at <br/>

<br/>
to see where you would be boxing.  And I'm sure there are other web<br/>
sites just as accommodating.<br/>
<br/>
As for planting, either use the park address or at least the town <br/>
zip code, for which, you can get the ZIP Code at <br/>
<br/>
<a href="http://zip4.usps.com/zip4/citytown.jsp" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://zip4.usps.com/zip4/citytown.jsp</a><br/>
<br/>
Enter the nearest city/state to retrieve your posting entry data.<br/>
<br/>
For large cities with multiple ZIP Codes - just pick the first one <br/>
EX: Baltimore MD has 66, but they all start with 212##<br/>
<br/>
If LBNA and AQ would both allow searches on the first 3 digits or all<br/>
5 digits you will get specific area boxes or USPS Sectional Center<br/>
area listings.<br/>
<br/>
Well, a suggestion like this would surely keep Ryan busy!!<br/>

you can put in 212** to get Baltimore boxes, or 191** for Philly boxes, <br/>
but it seems the site is down right now, so I can't check for sure.<br/>
<br/>
I find the radius search on AQ to be much, much more useful then the <br/>
county look up on .org.  It is much easier to put int he city you are <br/>
going to and be able to right away pick up boxes right over the border <br/>
in the next county or even next state, while ignoring boxes that are in <br/>
the same county but still an hour away.<br/>

<br/>
Those boxes and clues for which the owner no longer even answers <br/>
questions about them. <br/>
<br/>
This is a long standing and difficult problem in letterboxing. <br/>
<br/>
Over on the LbNA letterboxing.org site this became a huge problem. <br/>
If someone wrote to the website about an abandoned box, often an <br/>
angry complaint, it was the webmasters who had to deal with the <br/>
problem. As the hobby aged and more and more boxes were abandoned, <br/>
they got tired of answering angry questions about them. So, one year <br/>
they archived all clues where the owner could not be contacted.  <br/>
<br/>
This was when adopting boxes came into being. Many of <br/>
these "orphaned" boxes were good boxes still enjoyed by many. But <br/>
LbNA rightfully insisted that someone had to take responsibility for <br/>
them. A lot of boxes were adopted by others willing to maintain <br/>
them. If the owner returned to the hobby the adopters would happily <br/>
give them back. <br/>
<br/>
A letterbox, and the clues for it, are the property of the placer. <br/>
But the webmaster is responsible for the website and takes the rap <br/>
if there is no one else to be found. <br/>
<br/>
Scarab<br/>
<br/>
P.S. There are still a lot of abandoned and archived letterboxes out <br/>
there in the wild, unadopted and unlisted. LbNA has an archived site <br/>
with the clues still posted. They call it the "basement" or <br/>
something. Some boxers have fun tracking these down to see if they <br/>
are still there. Finding a forgotten box is a big thrill. <br/>

<br/>
</span></blockquote>I can say from my long days as a webmaster that there is a some<br/>
portion of the public that equates "webmaster" == "gamemaster".  Some<br/>
of the messages had the tone that indicated an expectation that the<br/>
webmasters knew everything about every box on the site, were responsible<br/>
for every box on the site, or in some cases, planted every box on the<br/>
site (or at least the box in question, which is really the same thing<br/>
for a given random box -- "you know, your box in thisthat county is<br/>
missing, you should check it out").  I wish I had saved some of them.<br/>
<br/>
It not something I ever attempted to figure out.  It just was.  The<br/>
only explanation to offer was, at the time, a popular website in<br/>
a similar hobby did have volunteers who pretty much vetted/approved<br/>
clues (one wonders if that is possible now given the volumes), and<br/>
perhaps people came in with that frame of reference.<br/>
<br/>
In defense of webmasters, it seems reasonable to remove text that<br/>
is generating angry mails.  No one wants angry mails.  And you can't<br/>
remove the people who are sending them.<br/>
<br/>
On another topic -- H&amp;H thanks for the evening; its nice to take home<br/>
such a lovely lady; we expect to enjoy a pleasant hike on the morrow.<br/>
As you may or may not know, I drop a clue at every gathering I attend,<br/>
I hope you enjoy the reading list, especially the top.<br/>

<p>I don't understand why it has to be so complicated. Maybe somebody can help

  "Abandoned boxes" <br/>&gt; <br/>&gt; Those boxes and clues for which the owner 
  no longer even answers <br/>&gt; questions about them. <br/>&gt; <br/>&gt; This 
  is a long standing and difficult problem in letterboxing. <br/>&gt; <br/>&gt; 
  Over on the LbNA letterboxing. org site this became a huge problem. 
  <br/>&gt; If someone wrote to the website about an abandoned box, often an 
  <br/>&gt; angry complaint, it was the webmasters who had to deal with the 
  <br/>&gt; problem. As the hobby aged and more and more boxes were abandoned, 
  <br/>&gt; they got tired of answering angry questions about them. So, one year 
  <br/>&gt; they archived all clues where the owner could not be contacted. 
  <br/>&gt; <br/>&gt; This was when adopting boxes came into being. Many of 
  <br/>&gt; these "orphaned" boxes were good boxes still enjoyed by many. But 
  <br/>&gt; LbNA rightfully insisted that someone had to take responsibility for 
  <br/>&gt; them. A lot of boxes were adopted by others willing to maintain 
  <br/>&gt; them. If the owner returned to the hobby the adopters would happily 
  <br/>&gt; give them back. <br/>&gt; <br/>&gt; A letterbox, and the clues for it, 
  are the property of the placer. <br/>&gt; But the webmaster is responsible for 
  the website and takes the rap <br/>&gt; if there is no one else to be found. 
  <br/>&gt; <br/>&gt; Scarab<br/>&gt; <br/>&gt; P.S. There are still a lot of 
  abandoned and archived letterboxes out <br/>&gt; there in the wild, unadopted 
  and unlisted. LbNA has an archived site <br/>&gt; with the clues still posted. 
  They call it the "basement" or <br/>&gt; something. Some boxers have fun 
  tracking these down to see if they <br/>&gt; are still there. Finding a 
  forgotten box is a big thrill. <br/>&gt; <br/>&gt; <br/>&gt; --- In <a href="mailto:lbma%40yahoogroups.com" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">lbma@yahoogroups. com</a>,

  <br/>&gt; &gt; Until I read this I did not use AQ but I paid for membership 
  <br/>&gt; because I believed that anyone <br/>&gt; &gt; who would put so much 
  effort into the game deserved my support. I <br/>&gt; no longer feel this 
  <br/>&gt; &gt; way. As owner of the site, I understand he would have the right 
  <br/>&gt; to delete my information, <br/>&gt; &gt; but MY boxes are not HIS 
  boxes. He has no jurisdiction in the <br/>&gt; real world and no right - 
  <br/>&gt; &gt; implied or otherwise - to offer them to anyone for anything. 
  This <br/>&gt; is not HIS game.<br/>&gt; &gt; <br/>&gt; &gt; I would encourage

<p>Like I mentioned before, the clues will still be publically accessible, just not <strong><u><em><font color="#ff0000">housed</font></em></u></strong> on AQ (the text of the clues will slowly get migrated) but the "boxes" should remain listed so that folks can log away if that is what floats their boats.  There may still be links to where they are stored from AQ, but definately from LBMA.  Again, no clue of ours will be hidden in an elitist fashion.  Some may need to go outside their comfort zones to access them</p>
<p>This also gives me a greater sense of clue security should one of those sites go down or disappear forever.</p>

<div><font face="Arial" size="2">When Dave and I started this hobby we had LBNA 
and a few private LB web sites to choose from (no AQ). We proceeded to post all 
our clues to LBNA. When this AQ came along we listed all our boxes on there as 
well, but they link back to LBNA. It is very easy to edit our clues on LBNA and 
we can add one or two things to the AQ site, but most of the maintenance is done 
at LBNA. One good thing that I noticed about AQ vs LBNA is that when we log in 
our maintenance at AQ, all of the dates show on the list. At LBNA, if you log in 
a new date for manitenance (OK) the previous date disappears from the list.
