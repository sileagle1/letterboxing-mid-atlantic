<div><font face="Arial" size="2">As it turned out, there were actually more than the 
10 spaces that were posted about because you could park on the edge of the road. 
*And* as it turned out, at least as far as the impression I got, there was no 
parking problem because it wasn't a big gathering like I expected. I don't know 
if not everyone showed up or there was no problem just due to people coming and 
going. And you did have to drive to most of the boxes not at the pavillion 
unless you had all the time in the world to hike around and do them all in a 
very leisurely fashion, which we did not. And many of them were a hike of some 
kind after driving to the location. But it seemed to me like a regular sized 
gathering, not a so called big "national anniversary" gathering. I have a 
tendency to get overwhelmed when there are too many people and too much of a 
stamping frenzy and I never felt like that while I was there. It was a nice 
gathering with a very good, friendly feeling to it. </font></div>
<div><font face="Arial" size="2"></font> </div>
<div><font face="Arial" size="2">I guess we were at the pavillion from around 
1???.... untill around 3???? We had driven from R</font><font face="Arial" size="2">oanoke and then did 3 boxes in Hot Springs before we got there. After we 
left the pavillion we went and did </font><font face="Arial" size="2">the event 
boxes and only got 8 of them, mostly because of the time factor and the fact 
that we were very tired. I have an issue with hiding the event stamps all 
over the place but that was her choice. People coming from a long distance had 
time and traveling issues that I don't think were taken into consideration. 
People who came and stayed for 2-3-4 days had time to do it all with no problem 
but not everyone can do that with a so called national gathering. But it's over 
and done with now. She has the right to do what she wants to. </font><font face="Arial" size="2">All in all it was a good gathering and I really enjoyed 
meeting some very nice people from a different part of the country. I also 
finally met the Gallent Rogue himself!! </font></div>
<div><font face="Arial" size="2"></font> </div>
<div><font face="Arial" size="2">And it never rained on Saturday as far as I know. 
If there were any scattered sprinkles we never saw them. </font></div>
<div><font face="Arial" size="2"></font> </div>
<div><font face="Arial" size="2">We went back and did Max Patch the next morning 
before leaving the area. We had stayed in Newport Tenn, about 26 miles away and 
did the comfortable bed, steak and crab cakes for dinner at Ruby Tuesday's 
boxing thing as opposed to the hard, cold ground boxing thing. ++A boxer does 
not a camper have to be. There's room for those who enjoy sleeping on the 
cold hard ground and for those that enjoy a nice mattress.++</font></div>
<div><font face="Arial" size="2"></font> </div>
<div><font face="Arial" size="2">Max Patch is an easy box to get  once you get 
up to it, but the drive willllllll</font><font face="Arial" size="2"> kill ya!! 
LOL But it's BEAUTIFUL!!!!! </font><font face="Arial" size="2">Then we stopped in 
Bristol, Virginia and did two boxes before the rain started there. We didn't 
have time to wait till it stopped and do the other two. So by the time 
4survivors and I got back to DC and I took the train baaaaaaaaaaaak here, it 
</font><font face="Arial" size="2">was midnight. So guess who took advantage of 
being a civil servant and called in sick today?! God I love not working in the 
private s</font><font face="Arial" size="2">ector where you actually have to go to 
work every day!! LOL </font></div>
<div><font face="Arial" size="2"></font> </div>
<div><font face="Arial" size="2">Did I mention that North Carolina is extraordarily 
beautiful? North Carolina is extraordinarily beautiful! I hope I can go 
back down there and see more of it. </font></div>

  said nothing about the town itself, or the <br/>park. Just that the pavilion

Weather has <br/>&gt; been great so far... Asheville / Hot Springs are amazingly beautiful. <br/>&gt; Hot Springs reminds me of Topanga
 Canyon,,, the rustic hippie commune <br/>&gt; in the coastal mountains above Malibu California.. . except the <br/>&gt; Appalachian Trail runs down Main Street with markings on the sidewalk. <br/>&gt; Campground is very cool... Fat Cat runs the check in station... buy him <br/>&gt; a "pepsi"! Max Patch... wow! So far ... the town is full of AT thru <br/>&gt; hikers excited about TrailFest... this is a gathering of the most <br/>&gt; dedicated hikers in the country... I'm so pleased to be here... <br/>&gt; and "ahem"... I see nothing foolish about this venue Nathan! <br/>&gt; :)<br/>&gt; <br/><br/>Context is important. I said nothing about the town itself, or the <br/>park. Just that the pavilion area it is being held at has a lot that <br/>can handle only 10 cars. That is foolish.<br/><br/>I do hope you have a good time, and I am sure the gathering itself will <br/>overcome any such shortcomings.<br/><br/>-- <br/>Nathan Brown<br/><br/>AKA Cyclonic<br/>Penncoasters. com<br/><br/>The
