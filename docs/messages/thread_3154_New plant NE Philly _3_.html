This short walk will take you along 300 year old roads, past a toll <br/>
house for the Bustleton Turnpike &amp; into a 102 year old park which was <br/>
almost all industrialized area in the 1800s. <br/>
This box &amp; stamp were at a nearby location for Burholme Event of <br/>
4/5/08<br/>
Park on Bustleton  Ave. or Strahle St near the Pegasus Riding <br/>
Academy. They provide a therapeutic Riding Program for many <br/>
illnesses. Their link for website &amp; map: <br/>
<a href="http://www.fairmountpark.org/Pegasus.asp" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.fairmountpark.org/Pegasus.asp</a> <br/>
The old building on the corner was a toll house for the turnpike, it <br/>
also offered accommodations for travelers, and horses could be <br/>
accommodated in the stable behind the house. <br/>
<br/>
4,000 FOOT WALK(shorter walk route below): As you walk NE on the old <br/>
Bustleton Turnpike you will pass the newer building used for the <br/>
riding program. This Parkland was by the Fairmount Park Commission &amp; <br/>
the Philly Water Dept. to make a buffer zone removing industry from <br/>
the city's water supplies.   <br/>
<br/>
Then Right on Axe Factory Rd. (the 2 lane paved driveway (FPC Park to <br/>
R. &amp; 1990s McHomes to left)) this road was authorized 300 years ago <br/>
as a short cut from Lower Dublin Rd. (Welsh Rd.) to the Turnpike. It <br/>
was unnamed for a long time then called Factory Rd. then named Axe <br/>
Factory Rd.  There are 2 blocks of 1950s homes on the east end near <br/>
Welsh Rd &amp; Old Aston Rd. intersection.  The rest is park with paved <br/>
bike path along creek, &amp; this section of horse path &amp; driveway as you <br/>
will see it. <br/>
<br/>
Pass the horse rings, &amp; fronts of houses, <br/>
pass backs of homes &amp; yards, to end of last yard &amp; fence on left. <br/>
See the SILVER POLE on L. berm &amp; SILVER TREE on R. berm, follow line <br/>
from pole through tree 35 steps (from tree) to next silver metal pole.<br/>
<br/>
R. @ 45 about 20 feet is very gnarly tree with a mostly not gnarly <br/>
branch, 45 to L.@ 15 feet is a broken tree trunk 2 foot above  ground <br/>
w/ a live branch growing straight up. 7' left of straight up live <br/>
branch inside the horizontal trunk under bark is the home of the <br/>
Flying Horse.<br/>
Lots of park users in area; try not to attract attention &amp; rehide <br/>
well.<br/>
Kindly report finds &amp; any problems via AQ. Good Hunting to all!<br/>
The Axe Factory Rd. is about 9,000 feet end to end if you want to <br/>
follow it.  It's a nice walk that gets better as you go SE. Cross the <br/>
large creek on steel bridge, R. on paved bike path is Axe Fac. Rd.  <br/>
Past highway overhead, pass path to L. @ small bridge. When you cross <br/>
the  stone bridge (medium sized 60') over the Axe Factory Run (creek) <br/>
go straight uphill to park limit &amp; homes on street to Welsh Rd.<br/>
1000' FOOT WALK TO FLYING HOUSE:  Drive NE on Bustleton  Ave. to R. <br/>
on Bergen St. to end @ Large St. <br/>
Park.  Enter park along yard fence to R., to dirt road @ berm road <br/>
shoulder. Start from Silver POLE &amp; TREE in clue above.  4-30-08</div>
