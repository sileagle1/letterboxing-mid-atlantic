needs is a virtual hug! <br/>
<br/>
I hate to admit it but when we first started boxing what we were <br/>
really after was a slew of clown hat, curly hair, winking smiley face <br/>
e-mails to improve our low self esteem.  When we didn't get said e-<br/>
mails I became bitter and disenfranchised.  Soon I found myself <br/>
walking the streets at night, looking for lemur bars.  <br/>
<br/>
It all makes sense now!  I just needed random icon based affirmations <br/>
from complete strangers!  I needed an over abundance of store bought <br/>
moron boxes so I could inflate my F count without getting out of the <br/>
car!  I NEEDED LOLLIPOPS AND RAINBOWS!  <br/>
