books available in used book stores-  ripe for hollowing out as library boxes.  His <br/>
fondness for verbosity makes the books especially thick and useful.<br/>
<br/>
Personally I prefer hollowing out the books of Anne Coulter or Newt Gingrich.  But that's <br/>
less to do with letterboxing and more to do with respect.<br/>
