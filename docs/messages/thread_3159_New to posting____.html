<br/>
I think that for as much as some people try to streamline the hobby<br/>
and make rules, there are still no rules and you can do with it what<br/>
you enjoy, what makes you most comfortable, and so on. I've been<br/>
boxing about 5 years now, and I've only found about 100 boxes, but I<br/>
don't think there's a correlation between F count and quality of the<br/>
letterboxer. <br/>
<br/>
Just have fun with it :)<br/>

                    <div id="ygrps-yiv-1645913181">One of the great things about this hobby is that you can determine <br/>
which pasture is right for you.  And if you don't like what's <br/>
happening in your pasture, you can bicker endlessly about it on a <br/>
myriad of different talk lists. (a right I like to exercise regularly)<br/>
<br/>
However if you are tired of cows and would prefer a smaller, easier to <br/>
conquer animal perhaps you should consider coming over to the lemur <br/>
pasture with me.  Do you own or can you get your hands on any blunt <br/>
weapons?  Are you willing to beat a dead lemur or does it seem to <br/>
futile?<br/>

<br/>
No "hardcore cred" is needed, at least as far as most people here on <br/>
the LBMA are concerned, as most are some of the most giving folks <br/>
around.<br/>
<br/>
As to what is considered 'good' or 'better' is totally subjective <br/>
and the eye of the beholder.  Speaking just from our own <br/>
experiences, more challenging boxes from a hike or clue <br/>
difficulty/trickiness perspective always give the finder greater <br/>
satisfaction and a much more fulfilling journey than punching a <br/>
ticket.  Other like a numbers game.  To each their own.<br/>
<br/>
We hope to meet up with you at the gathering in NJ in mid May that <br/>
Cyclonic is hosting.  Fresh perspectives and new folk energy is <br/>
always infectuous.<br/>

I think I need to clarify my thinking here a bit.  All of the drive-bys <br/>

You don't have to be "hard-core" to go out and find the "good stuff."  <br/>
Everyone can enjoy it, and I don't think anyone here restricts the boxes <br/>
that they place.  Sometime clues are hidden, but if you are clever you <br/>
can usually find them.  And the good stuff is all in a matter of how you <br/>
look at it.  For some folks it is a long hike, or a good puzzle, or a <br/>
nice stamp, or simply to find as many boxes as one can.<br/>
<br/>
I guess I am just lamenting the fact that so many folks only seem to go <br/>
for the short, easy stuff, and don't even give some of the more creative <br/>
stuff a second look.  I look at people's profiles and I find them rife <br/>
with the easy boxes, the little boxes, and very little in the way of <br/>
some of the more difficult stuff.  I find  those boxes and simple keep <br/>
seeing the usual suspects logged into them.  I think that is what I am <br/>

Now that I realized I want to   persue it further (while <br/>&gt; leaving them I home so I can hike further,   etc) I am starting to do <br/>&gt; longer hikes, in more dificult locations. I   do, in fact, have legs, <br/>&gt; but, perhaps I'm not "hard core" enough yet   to be considered worthy <br/>&gt; of the good stuff?<br/>&gt; And I'm really not   trying to be snarky here, just asking a question.<br/>&gt; <br/><br/>And it is a   good question.<br/><br/>I think I need to clarify my thinking here a bit. All of   the drive-bys <br/>and short walks and little boxes are fine, and they   certainly have a <br/>place. Heck, I search them out myself, but I do not get   the same joy <br/>out of them as I do going for some of the longer hikes, or   figuring out <br/>some of the mysteries that are out there.<br/><br/>You don't   have to be "hard-core" to go out and find the "good stuff." <br/>Everyone can   enjoy it, and I don't think anyone here restricts the boxes <br/>that they   place. Sometime clues are hidden, but if you are clever you <br/>can usually   find them. And the good stuff is all in a matter of how you <br/>look at it.   For some folks it is a long hike, or a good puzzle, or a <br/>nice stamp, or   simply to find as many boxes as one can.<br/><br/>I guess I am just lamenting   the fact that so many folks only seem to go <br/>for the short, easy stuff, and   don't even give some of the more creative <br/>stuff a second look. I look at   people's profiles and I find them rife <br/>with the easy boxes, the little   boxes, and very little in the way of <br/>some of the more difficult stuff. I   find those boxes and simple keep <br/>seeing the usual suspects logged into   them. I think that is what I am <br/>trying to get at.<br/><br/>Everyone that   sets their mind to it is worthy of finding these boxes.<br/><br/>-- <br/>Nathan   Brown<br/><br/>AKA Cyclonic<br/>Penncoasters. com<br/><br/>The Insensitivity   rolls on...<br/><br/>Vader '08<br/>Embrace the Dark Side!<br/><br/>McCarthy was   RIGHT!<br/><br/></p></div></blockquote> <span style="color:white;"></span> </div></blockquote></span></blockquote></div><br/></html></div>
