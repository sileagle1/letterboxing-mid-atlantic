<div><font face="Arial" size="2"></font> </div>
<div><font face="Arial" size="2">1) Posting public comments on AQ -- I set mine to 
moderate and figured I'd see what happened.  It has been my experience that 
very little gets posted on guestbooks, save by spammers and friends who want to 
make the site look important, so I expect that, at least until the spammers 
break in, no one is going to bother with a public comment anyway.  However, 
As I took a loooong hike into the woods yesterday, I thought about one of the 
harder boxes I've found.  The placer has retired, but the boxes are still 
around, mostly.  One may have been removed recently because of construction 
on its long-derelict home.  Telling the placer is pointless, but I can't 
let anyone else in the community know that it is not longer around, 
either.  Would be nice to have a way to let people know, before they tear 
their hair out over a box that doesn't exist anymore, that it is MIA for 
good.</font></div>
<div><font face="Arial" size="2"></font> </div>
<div><font face="Arial" size="2">2) It is not the length of the hike, but how you 
enjoy it.  Sometimes I need a really long hike, but most of the time I have 
the kids with me and they have very short legs yet.  I would have been 
thrilled to find a drive-by on our weekend outing last week, because I had to 
take frequent stretches for my broken body, but there were none to be 
hunted.  There seems to be plenty of room for library boxes, and they do 
not require hiking at all.  Sometimes ya just gotta go out and solve a 
puzzle, no matter how bad the weather is.</font></div>
<div><font face="Arial" size="2"></font> </div>
<div><font face="Arial" size="2">3) And, finally, in defense of AQ's search system, 
I found a zillion clues on AQ for French Creek tonight with no trouble at all, 
but had a devil of a time searching on LBNA because the park straddles county 
lines!!!!</font></div>

at least found what they were looking for.  For those of<br/>
us unfortunately and unavoidably trapped by the mundane,<br/>
there is always the next cycle, or a future sabbat, for<br/>
which plans involving my friends HD and GM, among others,<br/>
are already being made.<br/>
<br/>
And, of course, for collectors of small tokens with David<br/>
Lynch's three favorite colors, this major sabbat affects<br/>
a changing of the rules, as we know.  Perhaps the next<br/>
major sabbat will affect another change, only the Wheel<br/>
knows.<br/>
<br/>
So as not to be accused of intellectual preening by friends<br/>
of the father and other charlatans, we'll keep it brief; its<br/>
been a long day --<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply">  &gt; perhaps I'm not "hard core" enough yet to be considered<br/>
 &gt; worthy of the good stuff? And I'm really not trying to<br/>
 &gt; be snarky here, just asking a question.<br/>
<br/>
</span></blockquote>Some web site(s) require you to log dozens if not hundreds<br/>
of finds of boxes you may not be interested in to get to<br/>
the "good stuff" that you may be interested in.  Obviously,<br/>
that is their right and their prerogative, tho those of us<br/>
who actually celebrate beltane obviously find that idea<br/>
somewhere between silly and preposterous.  So, for _that_<br/>
"good stuff", you're up against a wall, I'm afraid.  The<br/>
solution is to write an http client, or download one, to<br/>
fake out said web site(s), much easier than logging 100<br/>
drive-bys when you don't even  believe in logging.<br/>
<br/>
OTOH, the other "good stuff" or "not so good stuff", as<br/>
the case may be, generally doesn't have that restriction.<br/>
I mean, it wouldn't be "good stuff" if it did, now would<br/>
it?  The good news is that you are in control of your own<br/>
worthiness.  There are no artificial or unrelated barriers<br/>
and other  annoying constraints.  That would be my<br/>
definition of "good stuff", even if the actual "stuff"<br/>
turns out to be "lame".<br/>
<br/>
Good luck.<br/>

<p>   This is suppose to be fun!!! Some of you seem to take it SO seriously.</p>
<p>   If you don't like AQ's bells and whistles don't use them. I go on AQ get clues and go for a hike. Usually a short hike but I'm out there enjoying the hobby. Some of you  probably look down on me because I'm not hardcore,lighten up!<br/><br/><blockquote><span title="qreply"> --- On <b>Thu, 5/1/08, Heather Siple <i>&lt;heather@...&gt;</i></b> wrote:<br/></span></blockquote></p>

&gt; <br/>
&gt; Some web site(s) require you to log dozens if not hundreds<br/>
&gt; of finds of boxes you may not be interested in to get to<br/>
&gt; the "good stuff" that you may be interested in.  Obviously,<br/>
&gt; that is their right and their prerogative, tho those of us<br/>
&gt; who actually celebrate beltane obviously find that idea<br/>
&gt; somewhere between silly and preposterous.  So, for _that_<br/>
&gt; "good stuff", you're up against a wall, I'm afraid.  The<br/>
&gt; solution is to write an http client, or download one, to<br/>
&gt; fake out said web site(s), much easier than logging 100<br/>
&gt; drive-bys when you don't even  believe in logging.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; OTOH, the other "good stuff" or "not so good stuff", as<br/>
&gt; the case may be, generally doesn't have that restriction.<br/>
&gt; I mean, it wouldn't be "good stuff" if it did, now would<br/>

them listed on both LBNA and AQ.  The primary reason I pulled them off<br/>
AQ was because I thought it was silly to have them listed twice.  I<br/>
started thinking that I would prefer that the boxes I found listed on<br/>
LBNA were DISTINCT from the boxes on AQ.  And so I voted with my feet.  <br/>
<br/>
Granted, I chose WHICH SITE to keep them on because AQ was starting to<br/>
get on my nerves.  And frankly, it's quicker now to update only one of<br/>
the sites every time I plant a box.<br/>
<br/>
So really, I never migrated them to LBNA (like I said I did a few days<br/>
ago), I just left them on LBNA and removed them from AQ.  <br/>

FONT-STYLE:italic;">allowing other people</span> to use them....  And yes, I think the virtual hug &amp; other buttons on the message boards are dumb, but if someone wants to use them, what harm does it do?<br/><br/>Suzanne<br/><br/><b><i>Heather Siple &lt;heather@sipleart. com&gt;</i></b> wrote:   <blockquote class="ygrps-yiv-2067577237replbq" style="BORDER-LEFT:rgb(16,16,255) 2px solid;"> <div><font face="Arial" size="2">I've been mulling over this whole conversation and came to a couple of counter points:</font></div> <div><font face="Arial" size="2"></font> </div> <div><font face="Arial" size="2">1) Posting public comments on AQ -- I set mine to moderate and figured I'd see what happened.  It has been my experience that very little gets posted on guestbooks, save by spammers and friends who want to make the site look important, so I expect that, at least until the spammers break in, no one is going to bother with a public comment anyway.  However, As I took a loooong hike into the woods
 yesterday, I thought about one of the harder boxes I've found.  The placer has retired, but the boxes are still around, mostly.  One may have been removed recently because of construction on its long-derelict home.  Telling the placer is pointless, but I can't let anyone else in the community know that it is not longer around, either.  Would be nice to have a way to let people know, before they tear their hair out over a box that doesn't exist anymore, that it is MIA for good.</font></div> <div><font face="Arial" size="2"></font> </div> <div><font face="Arial" size="2">2) It is not the length of the hike, but how you enjoy it.  Sometimes I need a really long hike, but most of the time I have the kids with me and they have very short legs yet.  I would have been thrilled to find a drive-by on our weekend outing last week, because I had to take frequent stretches for my broken body, but there were none to be hunted.  There seems to be plenty
 of room for library boxes, and they do not require hiking at all.  Sometimes ya just gotta go out and solve a puzzle, no matter how bad the weather is.</font></div> <div><font face="Arial" size="2"></font> </div> <div><font face="Arial" size="2">3) And, finally, in defense of AQ's search system, I found a zillion clues on AQ for French Creek tonight with no trouble at all, but had a devil of a time searching on LBNA because the park straddles county lines!!!!</font></div> <div><font face="Arial" size="2"></font> </div> <div><font face="Arial" size="2">Heather Siple<br/><a href="http://www.sipleart.com/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">www.sipleart. com</a><br/>"Reality can be beaten by enough imagination.
