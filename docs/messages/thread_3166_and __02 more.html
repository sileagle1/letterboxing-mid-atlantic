</span></blockquote>I could not agree more.  I do not understand the rush to remove listings <br/>
from AQ.  What is the big deal here?  Why all of the secrecy?<br/>
<br/>
Changes in the site do not make changes in the hobby.<br/>
<br/>
Personally, I would rather spend my time figuring out the clues or on <br/>
the trail, and not all day trying to figure out what county I will be <br/>
in, or what part of the county, or if there is a box a mile away but in <br/>
a different county.  Or a different state for that matter.<br/>
<br/>
I am glad some seems to think the same way.<br/>
