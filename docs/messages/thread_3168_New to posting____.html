      really haven't the <br/>&gt; faintest how to go about it, or what even 
      qualifies as "good."<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I started w/ drive-by's and short 
      hikes b/c that is what my family <br/>&gt; was up for. Now that I realized 
      I want to persue it further (while <br/>&gt; leaving them I home so I can 
      hike further, etc) I am starting to do <br/>&gt; longer hikes, in more 
      dificult locations. I do, in fact, have legs, <br/>&gt; but, perhaps I'm 
      not "hard core" enough yet to be considered worthy <br/>&gt; of the good 
      stuff?<br/>&gt; And I'm really not trying to be snarky here, just asking a 
      question.<br/>&gt; <br/><br/>And it is a good question.<br/><br/>I think I need 
      to clarify my thinking here a bit. All of the drive-bys <br/>and short 
      walks and little boxes are fine, and they certainly have a <br/>place. 
      Heck, I search them out myself, but I do not get the same joy <br/>out of 
      them as I do going for some of the longer hikes, or figuring out <br/>some 
      of the mysteries that are out there.<br/><br/>You don't have to be 
      "hard-core" to go out and find the "good stuff." <br/>Everyone can enjoy 
      it, and I don't think anyone here restricts the boxes <br/>that they place. 
      Sometime clues are hidden, but if you are clever you <br/>can usually find 
      them. And the good stuff is all in a matter of how you <br/>look at it. For 
      some folks it is a long hike, or a good puzzle, or a <br/>nice stamp, or 
      simply to find as many boxes as one can.<br/><br/>I guess I am just 
      lamenting the fact that so many folks only seem to go <br/>for the short, 
      easy stuff, and don't even give some of the more creative <br/>stuff a 
      second look. I look at people's profiles and I find them rife <br/>with the 
      easy boxes, the little boxes, and very little in the way of <br/>some of 
      the more difficult stuff. I find those boxes and simple keep <br/>seeing 
      the usual suspects logged into them. I think that is what I am <br/>trying 
      to get at.<br/><br/>Everyone that sets their mind to it is worthy of finding 
      these boxes.<br/><br/>-- <br/>Nathan Brown<br/><br/>AKA
