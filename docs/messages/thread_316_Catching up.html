<div><span class="ygrps-yiv-168975829875113501-27082004">I have a week off from work, so I went 
letterboxing yesterday and today.</span></div>
<div><span class="ygrps-yiv-168975829875113501-27082004"></span> </div>
<div><span class="ygrps-yiv-168975829875113501-27082004">Yesterday, I went to Berks County, PA, and 
found:</span></div>
<div><span class="ygrps-yiv-168975829875113501-27082004"> Mount Penn: Pagoda</span></div>
<div><span class="ygrps-yiv-168975829875113501-27082004"> Mount Penn: Penn Tower</span></div>
<div><span class="ygrps-yiv-168975829875113501-27082004"> Reading Pagoda</span></div>
<div><span class="ygrps-yiv-168975829875113501-27082004"> Southeast</span></div>
<div><span class="ygrps-yiv-168975829875113501-27082004"> Southwest</span></div>
<div><span class="ygrps-yiv-168975829875113501-27082004"></span> </div>
<div><span class="ygrps-yiv-168975829875113501-27082004">All were in good condition.  I think I 
walked through 7,433,984 cobwebs at French Creek Park looking for Southeast 
&amp; Southwest though.  I hope one of the spiders that bit me was 
radioactive!  And I got WAY lost looking for Reading Pagoda.  Ended up 
performing the most treacherous downward rock-climbing I've ever done.  But 
after 1.5 hours, I found it!  I also found some fascinating graffiti along 
the way:  "Embrace life for what it's worth, not what you want.  Greed 
is the root of all that is evil."  Maybe that's good advice for those 
letterboxers who are like me, and get really frustrated when the hunt is 
unsuccesful or when the clues just seem to make no sense.  After all, no 
matter what happens, we're out in the woods surrounded by beauty and 
nature!</span></div>

<div><span class="ygrps-yiv-168975829875113501-27082004">  Under the Sea</span></div>
<div><span class="ygrps-yiv-168975829875113501-27082004"></span> </div>
<div><span class="ygrps-yiv-168975829875113501-27082004">All were in good condition.  Under the 
Sea had some water in the outer container, but the bags were dry 
inside.</span></div>

Well I too am back from a summer of not having access to a computer <br/>
and being out in the woods.<br/>
<br/>
Nathan, sorry you did not get a chance to find the other box in Ft H, <br/>
it is only a 15 minute stroll. I know, b/c I placed it. I have yet to <br/>
find the others there, b/c they were not there when we place <br/>
Crossroads.  I got a warning before we went to Ohio last time... LOTS <br/>
of MIAs! Sounds like you proved that to be the case. Sorry, dude.<br/>
<br/>
I had the chance to go north for a day of boxing in NH. Got 5 out of <br/>
the 5 we looked for. Was hoping to also do some boxing in MA, but the <br/>
high amount of rain, and possible flooding, had us take a different <br/>
path home, and I did not have clues for that. :( Next time... I will <br/>
print alternative routes' clues as well. Lesson learned.  <br/>
<br/>
Would love to get up to PA and do some boxing and hoping to go to the <br/>
Ren Faire up there. Looking to go up on a Friday to box, then Sat at <br/>
the Faire, then home to work on Sunday.  Before I go, I will ask for <br/>
some 'must go to' boxes in that area. And maybe some good <br/>
directions. :) Oh, and maybe I will hook up with Irene to take care <br/>
of those shirts. lol. I have not forgotten!<br/>
<br/>

I know, b/c I placed it. I have yet to <br/>find the others there, b/c they were not there when we place <br/>Crossroads.  I got a warning before we went to Ohio last time... LOTS <br/>of MIAs! Sounds like you proved that to be the case. Sorry, dude.<br/><br/>I had the chance to go north for a day of boxing in NH. Got 5 out of <br/>the 5 we looked for. Was hoping to also do some boxing in MA, but the <br/>high amount of rain, and possible flooding, had us take a different <br/>path home, and I did not have clues for that. :( Next time... I will <br/>print alternative routes' clues as well. Lesson
 learned.  <br/><br/>Would love to get up to PA and do some boxing and hoping to go to the <br/>Ren Faire up there. Looking to go up on a Friday to box, then Sat at <br/>the Faire, then home to work on Sunday.  Before I go, I will ask for <br/>some 'must go to' boxes in that area. And maybe some good <br/>directions. :) Oh, and maybe I will hook up with Irene to take care <br/>of those shirts. lol.

</span></blockquote>Thanks, Scarab! Happy to be here. :) I hope to find both boxes at the <br/>
MD Ren Faire, this year. Curious about the Brass Dragon. :) I was not <br/>
sure if you were going to place Johnny back. Glad to hear of his <br/>
return as well. <br/>
The PA faire is north of Lancaster. I forget the town, but I have <br/>
friends going off and on all season. Has already started and runs the <br/>
same as MD. <br/>
<br/>
Where am I boxing this weekend? Good Question! I was thinking of <br/>
working on a few mystery boxes that are semi local. Got one in the <br/>
series, would like to get the rest. But still not sure where they all <br/>
are! *harumph*  Have to work on Sunday. So not much time. Am in PG <br/>
county MD tonight and most of tomorrow, so we shall see what I can <br/>
dig up in this area. <br/>
