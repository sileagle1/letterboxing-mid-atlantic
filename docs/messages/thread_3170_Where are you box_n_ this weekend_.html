<br/>
Back to the topic at hand, Schizokeet and I had a very nice weekend boxing.<br/>
<br/>
We headed to Dorney Park on Saturday and enjoyed some rides, and then <br/>
headed up to Locust Lake to camp.  On the way we stopped and got Mr. <br/>
Moneybags, a box she has been wanting to get since it was released.  <br/>
Very cool location, I recommend this indoor box.  On the way to the camp <br/>
we found Mail Pouch, a nice bug box, great stamp.<br/>
<br/>
It rained all night, but in the morning the sun came out and it was a <br/>
wonderful, warm day.  We had planned to go to Knoebels, but after taking <br/>
a walk to find a certain mystery box in the park (concerned parties will <br/>
be interested to know it is in fine shape), we decided to instead do <br/>
some more boxing before heading home.<br/>
<br/>
So, we rode over to Tuscarora State Park and found two of the three All <br/>
Animal Alliteration series.  We believe we know where the first box was, <br/>
but it is now long gone.  Then we found, after some persistence, Itch In <br/>
PA, another Bug box.  It had been a good 9 months since it was last <br/>
found, and was a bit damp inside, but none worse for the wear.  It was <br/>
well dried out before replaced.<br/>

Now I know what his name is."  After having 2 people email me an tell me 
that they were at the game Moneybags (which has nothing to do with a MR. 
Moneybags) and couldn't find it I thought I would do a search online to see how 
hard it would be to figure out if you didn't know the name.  Well I was 
surprised and a little embarrassed to find out that his name was Rich Uncle 
Pennybags.  His name was changed around 10 years ago, but I couldn't put 
the new name because that is a dead giveaway to the name of the game.  I

along the way I detoured to pick up two boxes in<br/>
Kinder Farm Park here in Maryland.  This is giving me<br/>
ideas for a future plant, combining a year round<br/>
volksmarch with a box.  Hmmm...<br/>
<br/>
The highlight of the journey was a really cool bamboo<br/>
forest that my son appreciated.  Creepy-cool.<br/>
<br/>
One of the boxes has been abandoned by the owner, I<br/>
think. He only planted one back in 2002. Someone else<br/>
had replaced the missing logbook, but most of the<br/>
recent finders are not boxers but kids playing in the<br/>
bamboo.  It wasn't concealed at all.<br/>

which you speak; we tried to find it two years ago and all was as you<br/>
describe even back then. But that bamboo forest--and the nearby pond<br/>
with the frog sounds--worth the trip.<br/>

Is it strange that I went back to get the last two boxes of a five box <br/>
series that I first started two years ago??  And I was so excited to <br/>
get that freakin' stamp -- couldn't even find the forth one, but got <br/>
that last one!  Did I mention I can't even log it as a find? <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
And it is also probably sad to most of you, that I got my first slab <br/>
of "pink stuff" this weekend.  I have a few ideas, but I am so afraid <br/>
to mess it up that I haven't gotten past the sketching stage.  But I <br/>
was very excited to buy it!</div>

He moved on to other things and I was left to carve for myself. Now I really enjoy and am not too shabby at it either! Just take your time and don't rush things. I just did a pretty large stamp and worked on it about an hour at a time. <br/><br/><b><i>amndaj &lt;amndaj@...&gt;</i></b> wrote:  <blockquote><span title="qreply"> <blockquote class="ygrps-yiv-1220900512replbq" style="PADDING-LEFT:5px;MARGIN-LEFT:5px;BORDER-LEFT:#1010ff 2px solid;"> <div id="ygrps-yiv-1220900512ygrp-text"> <div>And it is also probably sad to most of you, that I got my first slab <br/>of "pink stuff" this weekend.
