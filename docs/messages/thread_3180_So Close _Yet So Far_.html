                    <div id="ygrps-yiv-535665180">It sat there teasing me all week.  I was working in Wernersville PA. and every day I had to drive past a park which (gasp) had No Letterbox!  <br/>
I had an idea for a new series inspired by an offhand remark on the hairyleggers.  I cut the rubber Wed night and prepared to swoop in on my way home from work.<br/>
But we finished after dark and the local Smokey had taken up residence in the parking lot after sundown.<br/>
Today, it rained.  And rained and rained and rained and rained.  Normally I wouldn't be such a wimp, but I had a 3 hr drive and a dinner meeting that would go better for me if I didn't show up smelling like wet dog.<br/>
So South Mountain Park still doesn't have a box.  But I will be back next week...<br/>
Where am I boxing this weekend?<br/>
I'll bet you're glad you asked.<br/>
It looks like the first box of the new SemiMythical Bumppo series will go down in Birmingham Alabama.  Sadly out of LBMA jurisdiction.<br/>
<br/>
And when will I have time to plant the Phila Museum of Art box?<br/>
Good question.<br/>
Very good question indeed.<br/>
