If you were one of the many people who tried this series in recent years and were frustrated <br/>
by missing boxes 1 and 5, and the stampless box 4, we'd like to invite you to stop by again. <br/>
All three recarved stamps are faithful to the WimpyGirls originals, and we have changed the <br/>
locations for boxes 1 and 5, which will hopefully give them longer and happier lives. Also <br/>
note that the contents of usually soggy box 2 are now housed in a nice Lock n Lock. Enjoy!</div>
