you gave a can for a local food pantry and you got the stamp.  I am not <br/>
really into these types of boxes as I prefer to give to causes I know.  <br/>
But, to each their own, if it is something you want to do, then go for it.<br/>

there is always one who might ruin it.  Instead, I could just leave <br/>
contact info -- like a place to donate online, perhaps.<br/>
But I don't think I would make it so you had to donate in order to <br/>
stamp in.  It would be an option, but not manditory.  In my opinion, <br/>
getting info out about a cause could be just as important.<br/>
