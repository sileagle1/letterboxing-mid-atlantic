The following message contains commercial information which may offend some - more <br/>
sensitive - letterboxers.  STOP READING NOW if you do not wish to see commercial materials <br/>
on a letterboxing newsgroup.<br/>
<br/>
Since the demise of BOXHEADS I never know if it okay to talk about commercial items on <br/>
these groups.<br/>
<br/>
If you are like me and having trouble seeing what you are carving, it helps to have a lighted <br/>
magnifying glass handy for those tight lines.<br/>
<br/>
June 6, 7, 8 Harbor Freight (www.harborfreightusa.com) is having a  sale and included in their <br/>
wares is a swing arm magnifying lamp for $7.99.  I found it very helpful.<br/>
