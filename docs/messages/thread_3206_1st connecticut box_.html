<br/>
We visited married friends of ours who have recently moved from Europe <br/>
to CT and we were able to squeeze in our 1st CT box (so many to choose <br/>
from - 24 within 5 miles of their home!)  They joined us &amp; through <br/>
discussion of the hobby, discovered that one of them (British) knew the <br/>
history of letterboxing &amp; had found the one in Dartmoor while trekking <br/>
many years ago.  We were so psyched to introduce them to a hobby that <br/>
could help them discover more about their new surroundings (new places <br/>
to hike!) &amp; provide a link to his homeland.</div>
