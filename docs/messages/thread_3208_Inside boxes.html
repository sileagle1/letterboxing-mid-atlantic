shop box from the owner yesterday she said its gone.  All that is left are the beans and <br/>
spoon.  I don't have time to check up on it today.  Looks like I have a new log book to make <br/>
and a stamp to carve.  This time I think I will only make the logbook cover out of coffee <br/>
filters.  Stamping in on them doesn't seem to work out as well as I had hoped.<br/>
