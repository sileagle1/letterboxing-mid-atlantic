</span></blockquote>Wow, that's too bad. A suggestion: make the clues harder. That weeds <br/>
out the lazy letterboxers. The harder you've worked to find a box, <br/>
the more likely you are to respect it and rehide it properly. Those <br/>
who are too lazy and rushed to put a log back in the box are <br/>
probably not going to take the time to crack a tough clue.<br/>

the clue.  Sometimes boilerplate at the end of a document is <br/>
routinely skimmed past. And maybe something in c*o*l*o*r with <br/>
