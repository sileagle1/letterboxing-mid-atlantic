</span></blockquote>While we are setting rules for boxes, I think I have a few of my own:<br/>
<br/>
- You must be able to enjoy beer to enjoy one of my boxes, and Bud and <br/>
Miller don't count.  Plying me with beer may help however.<br/>
<br/>
- If you can't find the box, I may or may not help.  See the rule above.<br/>
<br/>
- All boxing buddies visiting my boxes must be flesh and blood, stuffed <br/>
animals need not apply.  Buddies must have a pulse, but a brain is not <br/>
required.<br/>
<br/>
- You may log, unlog, dislodge, disassemble, post, print, and ply my <br/>
box, but just put it back the way you found it in the end.<br/>
<br/>
- You may use any and all resources, conventional and unconventional, to <br/>
find my box, and you may brag about it to me.  See the first rule, again.<br/>
<br/>
- You must carry a mallet with you while hunting my boxes in order to <br/>
smash any purple, accordion playing, polka dancing squirrels, unless the <br/>
squirrel is playing "O Dem Golden Slippers" or giving out Jenny's number.<br/>
<br/>
- You must think outside the box.<br/>
<br/>
- You must enjoy the box.<br/>
