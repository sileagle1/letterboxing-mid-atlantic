<div><font face="Arial" size="2">Oncer a HH leaves your hands, you just have trust 
that it will travel the world with no ill effects. Unfortunately that is rarely 
so. At least you heard from it again! There are many of our HH's that we have 
never heard from again. I can only hope that they are too busy having a good 
time to write home!</font></div>

<p>I also posted this to AQ but since I'm venting, I'm posting it here 
  <br/>too...<br/>-----------<br/>Well, I had been wondering how a HH that I 
  released on 12/27/07 in PA <br/>was doing...since the box it was dropped in was 
  logged several times <br/>since then but no word on the HH. Of course I realize 
  that it's only 6 <br/>months later and that some people do not log finds of 
  boxes or HH's - <br/>but I still wondered how it was doing. Today I found out. 
  It turned up <br/>in a box in MI. It was alone in the baggie with no logbook. 
  Guess I <br/>wrote the HH name on the baggie (I really don't remember) but the 
  <br/>finder was able to find me. The HH was a tribute to another boxer whose 
  <br/>box I found destroyed by some NJ floods. The stamp was salvaged and I 
  <br/>made an HH out of it. So, it is not pleasant to hear of its current 
  <br/>status. I suppose I could run the list of who to blame....the person 
  <br/>who moved it, newbie or not, an errant geocacher or perhaps one of 
  <br/>natures logbook eating creatures that don't like the taste of stamps or 
  <br/>baggies...but it doesn't really matter.I'm just annoyed..... ....as 
  many <br/>have been before me...and many will be after me.<br/><br/></p></div></blockquote></span></blockquote></html>
