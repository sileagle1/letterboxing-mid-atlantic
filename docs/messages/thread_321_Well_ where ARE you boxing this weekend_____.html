I am not sure I am boxing this weekend (she says knowing full well she can't give up on that darn Jane Austin box calling,calling, calling "come find me"  from just 8 minutes away). Sorry, got caught up in the run on sentence theme of your post. I am leaving for my annual camping/caving Old Timers Reunion next Wednesday so I have LOT'S of stuff to do. Too busy to box really. Must keep telling myself..too busy to box....</div>
