I box alone, deep in the woods, and I can't tell you how much better <br/>
the dog makes me feel. She can smell/hear people coming before I can, <br/>
and she's fairly big. Also, we adopted her, and her one "issue" is <br/>
that she doesn't like men. She will bark at them, and sometimes <br/>
growl. She's pretty intimidating, really! If I get attacked by a <br/>
woman or child, I'm just SOL, but I think you would have to be one <br/>
crazy man to take on Cleo.I hear rapists look for crimes of <br/>
opportunity, and with my big dog, I'm not a very good opportunity.It <br/>
kind of stinks because I can't take her around lots of people (like <br/>
to Campin and Stampin!) or Starbucks, etc, but as issues go, its not <br/>
a bad one to have.<br/>
<br/>
Hit the ASPCA and get yourself a hiking buddy!<br/>
<br/>
However Cleo is completely useless around *animal* predators. We met <br/>
a quite large Black Bear in Washington state out in the woods, and <br/>
she looked at the bear, looked at me, and went back to sniffing the <br/>
weeds. Totally useless with the bear. The bear just wandered off, but <br/>
it was pretty scary! Ditto coyotes, groundhogs (they are actually <br/>
shockingly big when you are right next to one!), snakes. Totally <br/>
useless.<br/>

Only the 2 legged predators scare her.<br/>

                    <div id="ygrps-yiv-841830173">So true, stargazermomma.   Last summer I letterboxed solo (i.e. without the dogs) for the first time ever.  I was out of town for work and needed a way to spend my time outside of the job, plus get some exercise.  Most of the boxes I went after along the same greenway and as I got to know it, I felt much more comfortable, but that first day out, I felt so vulnerable and easily spooked.  I hadn't realized just how much I rely on the dogs to keep me informed about what's going on around me, particularly when I'm stamping in.<br/>
<br/>My LB buddy in Illinois also had a dog and the 5 of us - two females plus 3 dogs - would hit the trail together all the time.  Someone once asked her husband how he felt about two females alone on the trail - did he really think we were safe?  His response was that a person who was not deterred by a German Shepard and a pit bull would also not hesitate to attack a large group of people.<br/>

along the trail (maybe 100 feet away). I was real quiet hoping she <br/>

<p>What a perfect day for a hike! Dropped the kids off at Dorney Park, off for 
  a few hours of <br/>uninteruped boxing. Headed up South mt. clues in hand, just 
  what I wanted nice fairly long <br/>hike straight forward but imaginative 
  clues. Found the first few boxes then.... gosh it's really <br/>quiet out here, 
  no one around, did I tell anyone where I was going to be? Do I have cell 
  <br/>phone reception? What was that noise? Stared to imagine all kinds of 
  senerios in my head... <br/>Mainline mom missing, car found in parking lot, 
  mysterious ink smears on trail. Got to where <br/>I just wasn't having fun. I 
  have hiked alone before, what got me so spooked today?<br/><br/></p></div></blockquote></span></blockquote></html>

                    <div id="ygrps-yiv-322167960">I was out boxing this afternoon and after I found the<br/>
three boxes in the series I took the wrong way home. <br/>
Came to an unfamiliar road and then realized I had to<br/>
just backtrack all the way to the car.  Reversing<br/>
course, I stuck my hand in my pocket and realized my<br/>
cell phone was gone.  Sinking feeling.<br/>
<br/>
I kept thinking, if only I had a cell phone, I could<br/>
call my cell phone!  It was hard to erase that<br/>
interesting but idiotic thought.  Since I had to<br/>
backtrack anyway I searched each spot where I had<br/>
stamped in, to no avail.  I hoped I had left it in the<br/>
car, to no avail.<br/>
<br/>
I then began driving, looking for somewhere that had a<br/>
pay phone.  15 minutes down the road, at last, a 7-11.<br/>
 Took $2.00 of pay phone money [Did you know they<br/>
charge you fifty cents even when you don't make a<br/>
connection??!?] to call my teen with instructions to<br/>
WAIT 20 MINUTES, and then start calling every 3<br/>
minutes for a half an hour.<br/>
<br/>
Sped back to the woods, down the trail where I could<br/>
hear my phone ringing 50 feet off the trail at the<br/>
first place I stamped in.  16 missed messages from my<br/>
teen!  She thought starting earlier was helpful, but<br/>
I'm just glad it was a fairly non-traveled trail.  I<br/>
know *I* would certainly investigate a phone ringing<br/>
in the woods!<br/>
<br/>
So that is a downside of hiking by yourself, but I'm<br/>
not quitting anytime soon.<br/>

hike with. I have an elderly Corgi who can now barley<br/>
make the 1mile round trip on a paved level trail to<br/>
check on my Walking the Dog series. This series has<br/>
images of local dogs. Travis the Dane passed a few<br/>
years ago, Gizmo died of heart failure last year and<br/>
now Brogan the Lab will no longer be seen on the<br/>
trail.<br/>
I'm am just sick about this. His owners were moving to<br/>
an assited living facillity and the moving van was<br/>
here yesterday but i did n't see Brogan anywhere.<br/>
Found out from another neighbor the couple had had<br/>
Brogan put down becausr they counldn't take him.  I<br/>
was thunder struck. They put him down? These people<br/>
seemed to love this dog, they walked him many times a<br/>
day in all weather. He was a beautiful gentle dog. If<br/>
I had only known I would have taken him.<br/>
I know sometimes as dog owners we have to make the<br/>
difficult choice to end a dog's life when they are ill<br/>
but htis was a healthy dog.</div>

<br/>
As most of you know I lost my Nikki 9-11-07 at 4:45 in the morning. <br/>
It was a traumatic experience, but I was comforted in the fact that <br/>
she choose the time and place to leave my company. She was almost <br/>
15yrs old.<br/>
<br/>
We now care for her sister. Caring for a geriatric dog is not easy. <br/>
We have celebrations when she poops outside and eats all her "num-<br/>
nums" (food). I know I sound like an idiot encouraging these <br/>
endeavors. But I care not what the neighborhood thinks. She has given <br/>
us almost 16yrs of non conditional love. I carry her 60-70 lbs down <br/>
the steps several times a day and push that butt back up the steps. I <br/>
would do nothing less for any loved one.<br/>
<br/>
Sometimes, my non-dog friends can't comprehend this commitment. I ask <br/>
them the age of their children. Most often it is much less then my <br/>
Tasha's. So I ask them to imagine losing their child. I've had my kid <br/>
longer. Would they do anything different?<br/>
<br/>
I am battling with myself and keep asking Tasha not to make me make <br/>
that decision or play God. I can't understand how someone could "put <br/>
down" a perfectly healthy being. Poor Brogan. Stupid people.<br/>
<br/>
OK, those that don't know the complex inter-species relationship can <br/>
delete this message. Those that love their furry companions, thanks <br/>
for listening.<br/>

&gt; I'm am just sick about this. His owners were moving to<br/>

&gt; <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt;   What a perfect day for a hike! Dropped the kids off at Dorney Park, off for a few hours <br/>
of <br/>
&gt;   uninteruped boxing. Headed up South mt. clues in hand, just what I wanted nice fairly <br/>
long <br/>
&gt;   hike straight forward but imaginative clues. Found the first few boxes then.... gosh it's <br/>
really <br/>
&gt;   quiet out here, no one around, did I tell anyone where I was going to be? Do I have cell <br/>
&gt;   phone reception? What was that noise? Stared to imagine all kinds of senerios in my <br/>
head... <br/>
&gt;   Mainline mom missing, car found in parking lot, mysterious ink smears on trail. Got to <br/>
where <br/>
&gt;   I just wasn't having fun. I have hiked alone before, what got me so spooked today?<br/>

&gt; &gt; The truck turned tail and scooted away.  Ain't gonna give no <br/>
&gt; &gt; outatowners no directions!<br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; The area had since been razed, I guess for more parking.<br/>

&gt; &gt; &gt; I was poking around behind a tree the other day, off the trail but<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; still in sight of it, like so many boxes are. My plan was to act<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; embarrassed like I had been caught finishing 'watering the <br/>
&gt; flowers'.<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; The benefit here is that they won't be scared, but won't linger <br/>
&gt; in <br/>
&gt; &gt; the<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; area after 'catching' you either. :)<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; My problem was there where too many helpful people who would find <br/>
&gt; me<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; on the trail or on a trail head gawking at my clue sheets and <br/>
&gt; maps.<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; Then they'd want to continue to be friendly not go away. <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; "Are you lost?"<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; "Nope, I got it now! Thanks!"<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; "Are you from far away? The blue trail is so nice this time of<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; year...blah blah blah."<br/>

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;I decided in the future the least suspicious way to act in that<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;situation is to just ignore her.<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Or wave to her and shout "Be sure to watch your step, and make <br/>
