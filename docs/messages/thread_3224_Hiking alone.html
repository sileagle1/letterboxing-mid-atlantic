<div><font face="Arial" size="2">I'm imagining the hiker tripping gaily along the 
trail and all of a sudden they hear it ringing in the bushes.   
lol   If I waited to go boxing with someone, I'd go even less than I 
do. I get depressed about having no one to go with most of the time so say the 
heck with it. New York City doesn't exactly have a thriving boxing community.
