&gt;I was just talking to someone yesterday who explained to me that New Castle <br/>
&gt;County SPCA just opted not to renew a contract to put down pit bulls whose <br/>
&gt;owners could not afford to pay a 100 dollar fee to the city of Wilmington.<br/>
&gt; I understand a new no kill facility is in the works for Townsend, DE that <br/>
&gt; sounds similar to the LaMancha place near Coatesville.<br/>

&gt; That's just awful. I'm surprised that a vet would do that. It's always <br/>
&gt; been my understanding that a vet wouldn't put a healthy animal down, that <br/>
&gt; it is against their ethics. The poor thing.<br/>

&gt; Had some responses that said I should get I dog to<br/>
&gt; hike with. I have an elderly Corgi who can now barley<br/>
&gt; make the 1mile round trip on a paved level trail to<br/>
&gt; check on my Walking the Dog series. This series has<br/>
&gt; images of local dogs. Travis the Dane passed a few<br/>
&gt; years ago, Gizmo died of heart failure last year and<br/>
&gt; now Brogan the Lab will no longer be seen on the<br/>
&gt; trail.<br/>
&gt; I'm am just sick about this. His owners were moving to<br/>
&gt; an assited living facillity and the moving van was<br/>
&gt; here yesterday but i did n't see Brogan anywhere.<br/>
&gt; Found out from another neighbor the couple had had<br/>
&gt; Brogan put down becausr they counldn't take him. I<br/>
&gt; was thunder struck. They put him down? These people<br/>
&gt; seemed to love this dog, they walked him many times a<br/>
&gt; day in all weather. He was a beautiful gentle dog. If<br/>
&gt; I had only known I would have taken him.<br/>
&gt; I know sometimes as dog owners we have to make the<br/>
&gt; difficult choice to end a dog's life when they are ill<br/>
&gt; but htis was a healthy dog.<br/>
