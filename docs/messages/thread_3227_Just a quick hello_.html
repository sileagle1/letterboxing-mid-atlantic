this newbie and I haven't had a lot of time for boxing. I have another<br/>

Friday I took a day off and went to Ridley to find some boxes. I'm<br/>
always limited on where I can go, since I'm not a car person. But I<br/>
can take the R3 to media and it's only 3 miles to the park. I think<br/>
I'm going to start putting public transit tips with my clues when<br/>
possible.<br/>
<br/>
I thought I could find more in a day (8 finds, 13 attempts), but that<br/>
means I have to go back! (Thanks again to mizScarlett, missmoon,<br/>
LightninBug and Sheba for the boxes).<br/>

I don't think I even got poison ivy, which I think is the Ridley park<br/>
official plant!!</div>
