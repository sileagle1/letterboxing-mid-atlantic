to DE when I got out of the car and looked down . . . what's that? . .<br/>
.why it is my camera I've been looking for all over the house!!  This<br/>
was my 2nd trip to DE since I last used it, so besides being rained on<br/>
I had also driven over it about 20 times trying to back up the car<br/>
between the azaleas.  <br/>
<br/>
First do they make any alarms that when I move more than 10 inches<br/>
from the camera it sounds???<br/>
<br/>
But what I really want to know, is has anyone tried a camera GPS Unit<br/>
that tracks where you take your pictures??  Specifically the Sony<br/>
version which links to Google.<br/>
<br/>
I thought it might help with clue writing so I know where that tree was.<br/>
<br/>
I know my Magellan GPS CrossOver barely works on the trails IF there<br/>
are trees around.  Like I hike in the desert!  So is the camera GPS<br/>
just as fussy?  <br/>
<br/>
How accurate are those Google destinations.  And I wonder if they<br/>
(Google) are going to capture my photos for their web site for the<br/>
man-on-the-street views!?!<br/>
