inbred Klinzai up here?  ;-)<br/>
<br/>
The grey stuff can be funky and rubbery, but it was pretty good and <br/>
cheap to learn and carve on.  I stopped using it when Blick started <br/>
carrying Mastercarve or I found a source of PzKut.<br/>
<br/>
Cheers and your always welcome to revisit the homeworld,<br/>

fine detail.  Stay away, far, FAR away, from Blick's beige stuff - it's <br/>
crumbly and will fall apart.  I had to go back and argue with the sales <br/>
staff to get my money back after carving a stamp only to have it break <br/>
in two just as I was finishing it up!<br/>

okay, but it was just too rubbery - my exacto slipped and I ended up <br/>
bleeding on the stamp. Blood comes off with nail polish remover, but I <br/>
kinda liked the effect.<br/>
