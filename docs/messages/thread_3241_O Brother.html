Sorry to hear about the health problem. Hope you recover rapidley. I <br/>
think LB will post clues in the near future after the terrain recovers <br/>
from the influx of boxeers.<br/>
<br/>
Best Wishes to you!<br/>

&gt; So how did everything go this past weekend?  I was not able to go due <br/>
to a health problem that is going to keep me out of boxing for the <br/>
summer but I'd love to hear about the gathering.  Is there a place that <br/>
the clues will be listed so that I might be able to go looking in the <br/>

linked to LBNA (maybe even AQ, depending upon creator preferences).  <br/>
We need to add a box or two that were donated at the gatherin (for <br/>
example the "Soggy Bottom Boys" that were not on the original clue <br/>
sheet.  The clues will also become available once the social trails <br/>
have diminished and the forest has returned to its pre-gather state - <br/>
probably in several weeks.  Pink Panther has the clue sheets, and you <br/>
can probably contact her to mail a set until we decide how best to <br/>
publically load them.<br/>
<br/>
Cheers,<br/>
