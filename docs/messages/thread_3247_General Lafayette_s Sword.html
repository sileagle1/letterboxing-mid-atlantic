<div><font face="Arial" size="2">Many millions.  The French king bankrolled the 
Continental Army's payroll for several years.  It was expedient for him, of 
course, since he wanted to aggravate the English.  English law also 
discouraged their colonies from having a gunpowder industry (making them 
dependant on buying their gunpowder from England), so during the War of 
Independance, we got about 90% of our gunpowder from France.</font></div>
