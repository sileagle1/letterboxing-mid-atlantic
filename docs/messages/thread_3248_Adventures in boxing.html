&gt; Wow, Allentown, York, Reading--you're certainly getting<br/>
&gt; out &amp; about these days.  Did you find South Mountain<br/>
&gt; in Reading?  I'm partial to that one....<br/>

&gt; Went up to Reading yesterday for Reading Pagoda. Had been<br/>
&gt; warned area might be a<br/>
&gt; little rough. I'm a little skittish hiking on my own<br/>
&gt; anyway, came up over<br/>
&gt; little hill and found the party spot. Lawn chairs, coolers<br/>
&gt; ,trash. fire ring,<br/>
&gt; thankfuly abandoned at the time. Little adrenaline surge<br/>
&gt; there.<br/>
&gt; Continued with clues looked to my left and there was box<br/>
&gt; out in open. Seemed to<br/>
&gt; have been found by non-boxers. At least they didn't<br/>
&gt; take it. Interesting<br/>
&gt; area. Glad to see pagoda is being maintained but area<br/>
&gt; around it is falling into<br/>
&gt; disrepair.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
