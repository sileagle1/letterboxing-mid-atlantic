<h3>Johnny Fox &amp; Brass Dragon Ren Fest</h3>Placed by: Scarab   (<a class="ygrps-yiv-1628334600boxview" href="http://letterboxing.org/Contact.asp?toID=255" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">contact the placer</a>)<br/>Placement date: Sep 6 2003<br/>State: Maryland<br/>County: Anne Arundel <br/>Nearest city: Crownsville<br/>Number of boxes: 2<br/>
<h4>Clues</h4>I have replanted Johnny Fox and added the Brass Dragon<br/><br/>These are temporary microboxes for the duration of the Maryland Renaissance Fair season. Check local listings, or Google their website, for opening hours and fees.<br/><br/>Johnny Fox,<br/><br/>sword swallower extraordinaire, has been entertaining at the MD Ren Fest for over 20 years. The first time I saw his show I was so shocked, I laughed so hard I cried and I hurt. "Water from India," protects him from harm. I'll let you figure out whether he really swallows the swords or not. <br/><br/>After the show buy some snacks from Johnny Fox's Almonds booth. Then turn left past the School of Juggling and find an interesting triple tree with a trunk smaller than the other two. Behind it is a zig zag path going down the hill. Halfway down find a long curved bench. Count 4 support posts from right to left and sit down next to the 4th one. Reach under the bench and between the supports for what you seek.<br/><br/>Brass
 Dragon<br/><br/>Stroll up Kenwood Lane. Note the "King of Swords" shop. He is my family's armorer. We have five of his fine wooden shords and knives. Every year he repaints them for us. <br/><br/>Find the Brass Dragon. Be sure to look carefully as you will recognize one of them later. Count the number of dragons above the rain gutter. Multiply that number by 60 and head off in that direction. Stop at the stage sign.<br/><br/>From there head straight south to the two big chairs. Yea, they are pretty important chairs. Stand behind the bigger one. Multiply the same number by 28. Head off in that direction. Pass horns hanging on your right. Pass a place of many unnatural objects. <br/><br/>Up ahead you will see an imposing yellowish building on a hill. Count the number of flying buttresses. Count the number of winged creatures in the roof. Add those two numbers together and multiply them by 5. Stand inside by the back door of the building. Process out the front doors for that number of steps.
 Act grand as you walk. <br/><br/>Multiply your original number of dragons times 7. Add that to your footstep count and head of in this new direction. <br/><br/>Pass turkey legs. Pass a tall toad. Pass the first of two trees "in the middle of the way". Pass ancient mysteries and prophecies. You seek a place with magical potions. They line the walls on shelves. Which one would I find particularly interesting? How many sides does the container have? Multiply that number by 3 to get X. From the magic corner count the number of double posts along the rail. Between the Xth posts, under the rail, in front of a big tree with a fat poison ivy vine (be careful), find the Brass Dragon. <br/><br/>Scarab of the Doubtful Guests</div><p>

I MISSED YA!!!!!<br/>
I had every intention to get the clues to our new box at the faire <br/>
posted by today so that when ya came to place them ya might find it. <br/>
But being as we are full time vendors at the festival, I was just a <br/>
wee bit busy last week and didn't get it done! *&amp;^($#! <br/>
Oh well, maybe we will catch ya on Pyrate Wknd. We will hunt your <br/>
boxes first thing tomorrow, most likely before anyone comes in, he <br/>
he! Thats the only time Mama Woodwose and I both get out of the booth <br/>
together. Well, I off to write my new clues. <br/>
Thanks for bring boxing to my little faire. <br/>
Peace,<br/>

</span></blockquote>Ok now, Just to be completely honest. I won't be checking that clue. <br/>
(Oh boy, I'm a very berry busy faery right now....) It sounds really <br/>
cool, and I will keep the clue with me and look at some of the things <br/>
ya pointed out, maybe add some of them up and do the compass points <br/>
for practice, when I find time. However, I know exactly the tree your <br/>
are talking about. I am much more than just familar the site. As I <br/>
live right in Crownsville,(did ya do my "Green Rose Labyrinth Box <br/>
today? I haven't been out back to check, but ya most likely had to <br/>
pass the location to get to the Faire!) I get all over the faire, and <br/>
have several friends in the area of the box, the ________, Whoops I <br/>
almost gave it away! He He! Oh, and Johnny said he had heard about ya <br/>
little box, and I promised him I would take him to it to sign in!!!;')<br/>
