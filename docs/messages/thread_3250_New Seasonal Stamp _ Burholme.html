Sky stamp at the new July 4th Seasonal hide in Burholme Park, Near <br/>
Cheltenham, Pa. (in Philly on border). NO COMPASS NEEDED.<br/>
Check LBNA or AQ for info. Check the front steps for a new free park <br/>
tour sheet.<br/>
The Forth is always a great evening on The Hill with 30 mile views. On <br/>
7/4 &amp; 1/1 you can see the Art Museum &amp; many other choice locations if <br/>
visibility is more then 10 miles.<br/>
I plan to be there for the fiery sky myself.<br/>
