couldn't identify the soldier and so did not proceed to the location <br/>
for the box itself - some particulars are unknown here - but we're <br/>
grateful that we can get the log back.<br/>
<br/>
I'm hoping that we will recarve and replant, maybe a bit further back, <br/>
maybe in the next few months.</div>

<br/>
I enjoyed the mile or two on an up-up-up trail, but then was dismayed to spot the box sitting completely exposed on top of some rocks, five feet from the supposed hiding place.  Who could have been so careless, I wondered?<br/>
<br/>
I took the box back down the trail a ways to stamp in, and lo and behold, I was the first finder?  So why would the PLACER leave the box exposed?  When I was replacing the contents I looked  more carefully at the lid.  Gouged into the new plastic were five distinct CLAW marks, and what looked like more scratches or teeth marks along one edge.  <br/>
<br/>
So apparently I WASN'T the first finder, after all!<br/>
<br/>
And yes, I heard bears in the woods all the way back down the trail, lol.<br/>
