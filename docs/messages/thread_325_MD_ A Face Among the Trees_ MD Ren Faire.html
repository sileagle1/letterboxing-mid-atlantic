G____ __N <br/>
A Poem By Bill Lewis <br/>
<br/>
G____ __N grin and gurn <br/>
From blackened beams <br/>
that creak and groan <br/>
as ancient houses dream <br/>
and are swayed by <br/>
wind in branches <br/>
long since snapped. <br/>
Foliate Faces flower and the <br/>
memory of an antique hour <br/>
unwinds beneath <br/>
a carpenters craft; <br/>
masons too, saw their shape <br/>
sleeping in the stone. <br/>
So all is forest then, <br/>
vegetable, mineral, flesh, bone. <br/>
The world tree becomes <br/>
the column of my spine; <br/>
eyelids leaves of oak; <br/>
fingers ash and pine. <br/>
I am lost within a wood <br/>
that is lost within me. <br/>
G____ __N grin and gurn, <br/>
for no one knows more than they <br/>
what is and is not tree. <br/>
<br/>
Who is he? A mystery of tree? Would ya like to meet him? <br/>
Well, visit the village of Revel Grove. Enter the gates and stroll <br/>
the lanes of the Faire. <br/>
Where the pipe organ plays it mighty tune, turn right. A chance for <br/>
directions can be <br/>
found amongst the bubble fairies, for their Master is he who hides. <br/>
Follow the lane down <br/>
the way. Seek the purveyor of fancy fairie facades for your face. <br/>
There are two <br/>
establishments of this kind. Seek the one on the right, near the <br/>
wandering maze and <br/>
betwixt and between the interlacers of tresses and those crafty <br/>
celts. In the place created <br/>
by the miscellaneous oddiments, there is a wall of those leaf faced <br/>
lords and ladies. Stand <br/>
and meet their gaze, read and learn and then look up. Corbeled in the <br/>
ceiling lie two more <br/>
of there kind and nearby where you stand, just above your eye, nested <br/>
behind the vine, <br/>
you will find an emerald green box perhaps unlike any other you have <br/>
hunted. If the shop <br/>
is filled with unknowing customers, than perhaps retrieve yourselves <br/>
with a wink and a <br/>
nod to the the knowing crew. However, if time allows, tell them "I <br/>
would like to meet the <br/>
G____ __N" and then perhaps Papa Woodwose himself will present you <br/>
with the treasure <br/>
and then you will exchange your marks with one another.<br/>
Peaceful Trails, <br/>
Enjoy the Faire.</div>
