<div><font face="Arial" size="2">A friend of mine and I were pondering the demise of 
the Rockwood Park Ice Cream Festival here in Delaware, which got killed by the 
county due to financial reasons.  Unlike the re-opening of PA state parks, 
this one did not get revived after its first absence.  So, we decided to 
call out all the folks we could to come make our own.  The first stamp 
placed in that park, which was the first one I ever found, by a now-relocated 
Neverenuff, honored the festival.  Sounded like and excuse for a 
gather to me, as this will likely be a rather small celebration 
muggle-wise.  </font></div>

<div><font face="Arial" size="2">Henceforth, anyone out there who is free this 
Sunday from about 12:30 to whenever is welcome to come eat, play, exchange, look 
for the 4 boxes in the park, etc.  Bring your own food and lawn 
chairs.  We're supposed to have a grill,  a cooler of dry ice for 
anyone's ice cream and some old-fashioned games (croquet, bocce, an 
out-of-practice juggler who's happy to share her toys).  If anyone says 
they're coming, I'll see about carving up a quick event stamp.  I'm 
probably not posting this to AQ, because it is a last-minute, disorganized 
project and I don't think anyone who is not near Wilmington, DE will  be 
likely to show up on such short notice.  </font></div>
