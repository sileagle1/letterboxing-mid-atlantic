Hi everyone, I know it has been awhile since I posted last but I wanted <br/>
to let everyone know that I just got engaged. I decided to use <br/>
letterboxing as my way of asking. I created a pirate themed letterbox <br/>
with a stamp that said will you marry me and had it planted near the <br/>
Lake Huron coastline in Michigan. After she stamped the box stamp and <br/>
saw what it said I pulled out the real ring and asked her. I am proud <br/>
to say that she said yes.<br/>

&gt; Congrats!<br/>

&gt; &gt; Good call not putting the ring in the box.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I dropped an engagement ring in a box a few years<br/>
&gt; back (mapsurfer #84, the last one). Fortunately it<br/>
&gt; was found by the intended recipient, tho they went to<br/>
&gt; the wrong park first, and thus the engagement was<br/>
&gt; delayed.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Cheers<br/>
