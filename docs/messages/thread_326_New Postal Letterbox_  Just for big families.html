Sent this list to the Postal Letterbox group on Friday, and we've had <br/>
a few responses.<br/>
<br/>
Wanted to open this up to you fine folks next, before letting the <br/>
main list in.<br/>
<br/>
Still plenty of room, so if you qualify, throw your hat into the ring!<br/>
<br/>
Thanks,<br/>

Hello,<br/>
<br/>
Well, it's probably no surprise, as FamilyMan, that I like to see big <br/>
families.  My first effort at a PLB will be dedicated to that rare <br/>
breed, the family with 4 or more kids.  (Although, having 7 children, <br/>
I think 4 kids is kind of a small family...8-D)<br/>
<br/>
If you have 4 or more children, please feel free to sign up for this <br/>
one.  They don't all have to live at home with you (my oldest is off <br/>
at college), just belong to you!<br/>
<br/>
Naturally, the honor system is in order here--no one is asking for <br/>
pictures or birth certificates.  Maybe a family picture in the <br/>
logbook?  Open to ideas there.<br/>
<br/>
What do you think?  I wonder if we'll hit 20 folks? <br/>
<br/>
Thanks,<br/>
FamilyMan<br/>
