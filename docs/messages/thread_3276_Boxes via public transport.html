Hadrosaurus is less than a mile from the Haddonfield station. (And  <br/>

There's a whole series of boxes, Freight Train, that involves riding  <br/>

train station, but I must not name them.  About 1.75 miles north of the <br/>
station is Brandywine Park, in which you will find quite a lot of active <br/>
boxes, including the FotB series and I left My Hearts in Brandywine Park. <br/>
Brandywine Park connects to Rockford Park/Bancroft Mills/Alapocas Run Park, <br/>
where you can find the most excellent Cliffhanger series, among other <br/>
things.  There are a number of mysteries strewn for four or five miles from <br/>
the Zoo all the way across through Alapocas.  A quick trip it is not.  I <br/>
have ridden my bike happily from about 2 miles northeast of Alapocas all the <br/>
way to the Zoo in Brandywine Park, but to go through the greenway you may <br/>
have to walk even a mountain bike in one or two places.  It is a great trek <br/>
for those who want to be out for the hike and bike!  Those who are not into <br/>
Kamikaze biking might want to take their bikes on the bus to the zoo, or at <br/>
least to Rodney Square, which is about 12 blocks from the station and four <br/>
from Brandywine Park.  All our busses are equipped with bike racks these <br/>
days, and we don't have bike lanes in the city.<br/>

</span></blockquote>Yes, the park pretty much surrounds the college, and there are even some <br/>
boxes at the college.<br/>
<br/>
Other places in Lower Bucks to try are along the R7 line.<br/>
<br/>
Neshaminy State Park is less then a mile from the Edington station.  <br/>
There are several boxes there, more if someone would post her clues ;-)<br/>
<br/>
There are four (soon to be five) boxes within a 15 minute walk of the <br/>
Bristol station as well.<br/>
<br/>
There are a bunch of boxes within easy reach of the main line stations <br/>
along the R5 as well.<br/>

one -- from Claymont to Cauffiel to Bellevue to Rockwood to Alapocas to 
Brandywine Park in town/the zoo and then home by way of the Wilmington

boxing.  For laughs, I checked the route on Google Maps. Throw in BCSP

You can also take the R6 to Wissahickon and enter the park by the<br/>
transfer center, OR take the 9 bus (I'm assuming you're in West Philly<br/>
and can get to a 9 Northbound) to the transfer center.  You can bike<br/>
in the park. There are a number of active boxes there. <br/>

&gt; Hey folks:<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Since my trip to Ridley Creek went so well, I want to plan another<br/>
&gt; letterboxing via public transport (Philly area) extravaganza.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Since some of these places require more then a little travel time,<br/>
&gt; it's a better day if I can be assured of several active boxes in one<br/>
&gt; area/park. I don't mind hoofing or biking it a couple miles, kinda the<br/>
&gt; point, eh?<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I know Wilmington was mentioned, but I have never been there and am<br/>
&gt; totally unfamiliar with the area. Are there really several boxes<br/>
&gt; within a reasonable distance from the train station? <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; How about some of the NJ suburban parks? Anyplace accessible via PATCO?<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I think I can also get to Tyler. It's a long haul trip R3 to<br/>
&gt; Langhorne, then a bus ride with a limited schedule. However it drops<br/>
&gt; me off at the Community college, which looks like it's at Tyler's<br/>
&gt; doorstep, correct? <br/>
&gt; <br/>

&gt; I can have a box at every SEPTA EL stop by noon tomorrow.<br/>

just in<br/>
&gt; case.<br/>
