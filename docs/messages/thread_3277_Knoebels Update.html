                    <div id="ygrps-yiv-536203680">Just wanted to update folks on the gathering.<br/>
<br/>
Now in its forth year, I hope to see many familiar faces as well as some <br/>
new ones at Knoebels Groves in Elysburg, PA. <br/>
<br/>
Why four years running now? <br/>
<br/>
Because Knoebels is a great amusement park, and it is free to get in.  <br/>
They have loads of food as well as a camping ground right next door.  <br/>
The phoenix, one of their three wooden roller coasters, is constantly <br/>
rated one of the best in the world.<br/>
<br/>
As usual, this is a very laid back event, bring all the event boxes you <br/>
care to, or none at all, it is up to you, just come and have some fun.  <br/>
There will be a smattering of boxes hidden around the park, and some new <br/>
local boxes as well.<br/>
<br/>
This year the gathering will be in pavilion P-3.  This pavilion is <br/>
behind the Sklooosh, and we will have it all to ourselves, with plenty <br/>
of room for everyone.  The gathering officially runs from 9AM to Noon, <br/>
but we have the pavilion all day, so you can set up there with lunch or <br/>
to just relax.<br/>
<br/>
Two platform sites on the Texas Panhandle have already been reserved for <br/>
the gathering.  Anyone wishing to camp with the group should reserve <br/>
sites there.  There is one platform left and several sites.  It is a <br/>
wooded, fairly secluded area, and a great place for our usual after <br/>
gathering camp fire.<br/>
<br/>
The pre-gathering get together will be once again held at DeVitto's <br/>
Pizza in Ashland at 7PM on Friday night.<br/>
<br/>
More information will be coming soon.<br/>
<br/>
You can sign up for the gathering here:<br/>
<a href="http://www.atlasquest.com/events/event.html?gEventId=633" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.atlasquest.com/events/event.html?gEventId=633</a><br/>
<br/>
Sign up is not necessary though, just come on out and have a good time.<br/>

parked out front.  If you see us out and about, drop by and say hi. 
We’d be happy to do an exchange with you. Rainmaker and the kids have personal

&gt; &gt; the gathering.  Anyone wishing to camp with the group should <br/>
reserve <br/>
&gt; &gt; sites there.  It is a wooded, fairly secluded area, and a great <br/>
place <br/>
&gt; &gt; for our usual after gathering camp fire.  The campfire will <br/>
probably <br/>
&gt; &gt; come together at about 8PM. BYOB!<br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; For those coming in on Friday, we will be having dinner at <br/>
DeVitto's in <br/>
&gt; &gt; Ashland.  The restaurant is on Centre Street just a few blocks up <br/>
from <br/>
&gt; &gt; the Mother statue.  Dinner will be at 7PM, and, of course, there <br/>
is a <br/>
&gt; &gt; box there.<br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; Can't wait to see some new faces as well as the old familiar ones.<br/>
