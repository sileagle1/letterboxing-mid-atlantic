<div>I would LOVE to crash at your place, unfortunately I have this thing called a J-O-B that keeps interfering with my letterboxing! I am not on Vay-Cay until Wednesday so if I do run down I must turn around and boogie right back home. So that's 5 hours round trip for one stamp. I'm crazy, but I don't think I'm that crazy. I probably won't make it.</div>

<p>2.  The Desert Moon cafe no longer exists.</p>
<p>3.  A store, and an important clue in the local letterbox, has closed.</p>
<p>Fortunately Sam I Am already knew where the letterbox was.  When I arrived I could see her up there on the bench.  When I got up there she recognized Sowsowbizzy walking around way down in the food court.  Sam stayed, following her and pointing, while I went down to get her.  It was fun looking up 4 floors to Sam pointing down to the ground level for me.  When we got back Schizokeet and Night Owl found us.  </p>
<p>We all passed around It's a Holiday's new stamp, Sally the Rag Doll.  Sam I Am did a wonderful job coloring it.  Coloring really makes a stamp look better than it really is.  I don't want to hear any more complaints about simple stamps.  Any stamp can look great with coloring, even my early, crude stamps, as I found out in Firefly's logbook.</p>
<p>And Sowsowbizzy, this does not get you off the hook for carving a bigger Sally to go with  your  NMBC collection.  :-)</p>
<p>We left a note in the letterbox to find us in the American Cafe and repaired to dinner, a big blue moon drink in a orb glass, and fun conversation and comeraderie.  </p>
<p>We tentatively decided to go ahead with a Northern Virginia Halloween Saturday gather, perhaps in my front yard.  Details if I figure this one out.  </p>
<p>Oh, and yeah, everyone got to stamp into the Once in a Blue Moon postal letterbox.  Personally I think a postal is a good excuse for anyone to call for a party.  (As long as you don't delay it or use up too many pages.)</p>
<p>My humble apologies to anyone who could not figure out the mystery.  Many thanks to Sam I Am, Sowsowbizzy, Schizokeet and Night Owl for showing up and for a good time.</p>

<p>We left a note in the letterbox to find us in the American Cafe and repaired to dinner, a big blue moon drink in a orb glass, and fun conversation and comeraderie.  </p>
<p>We tentatively decided to go ahead with a Northern Virginia Halloween Saturday gather, perhaps in my front yard.  Details if I figure this one out.  </p>
<p>Oh, and yeah, everyone got to stamp into the Once in a Blue Moon postal letterbox.  Personally I think a postal is a good excuse for anyone to call for a party.  (As long as you don't delay it or use up too many pages.)</p>
<p>My humble apologies to anyone who could not figure out the mystery.  Many thanks to Sam I Am, Sowsowbizzy, Schizokeet and Night Owl for showing up and for a good time.</p>
