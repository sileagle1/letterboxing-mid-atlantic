This is too funny.  I posted about this very subject on AQ a few weeks <br/>
ago, and of course I got the whole how dare I presume to tell others <br/>
what they can and cannot have as a gathering from the kool-aid drinkers, <br/>
or that I should just ignore them.  But, you know, if there is something <br/>
you don't agree with, not saying anything is sure to change nothing.<br/>
<br/>
I agree with Sheba though is a way, we have posted things that would be <br/>
questionable in their nature, like parties and such, but is that going <br/>
as far as posting a yard sale or a Tuperware party as a gathering?  If <br/>
letterboxing is not the central theme of the get together, and just a <br/>
lure, should it be posted as a gathering?  I don't think so.<br/>
<br/>
After Knoebels this year I think I am no longer going to use the AQ <br/>
system for my gatherings.  I will create my own information page on my <br/>
website and post updates here and in other places.  The only reason I <br/>
even do it now is for the benefit of folks who are looking to get <br/>
personal travelers.  I guess people are just going to have to be more <br/>
prepared, or I will have to create a system of my own.<br/>
<br/>
While there is nothing wrong with people doing all these other things, I <br/>
question what it all has to do with letterboxing.<br/>

<div><font face="Arial" size="2"><br/><br/>HAHAHA!!!<br/><br/>This is too funny. I 
posted about this very subject on AQ a few weeks <br/>ago, and of course I got 
the whole how dare I presume to tell others <br/>what they can and cannot have as 
a gathering from the kool-aid drinkers, <br/>or that I should just ignore them. 
But, you know, if there is something <br/>you don't agree with, not saying 
anything is sure to change nothing.<br/><br/>I agree with Sheba though is a way, 
we have posted things that would be <br/>questionable in their nature, like 
parties and such, but is that going <br/>as far as posting a yard sale or a 
Tuperware party as a gathering? If <br/>letterboxing is not the central theme of 
the get together, and just a <br/>lure, should it be posted as a gathering? I 
don't think so.<br/><br/>After Knoebels this year I think I am no longer going to 
use the AQ <br/>system for my gatherings. I will create my own information page 
on my <br/>website and post updates here and in other places. The only reason I 
<br/>even do it now is for the benefit of folks who are looking to get 
<br/>personal travelers. I guess people are just going to have to be more 
<br/>prepared, or I will have to create a system of my own.<br/><br/>While there is 
nothing wrong with people doing all these other things, I <br/>question what it 
all has to do with letterboxing.<br/><br/>-- <br/>Nathan Brown<br/><br/>AKA

<br/>
I agree...that's my big complaint too.  I wish Atlas Quest would start<br/>
calling itself "a place to have adventures and meet fellow<br/>
adventurers" or even "a place for quests and fellow questers" or<br/>
something like that.  They could accurately say that "SOME of the<br/>
quests listed here are part of a hobby called letterboxing" or<br/>
something like that.  I have no problem with it all existing, just<br/>
with referring to it as letterboxing.  However, this is probably the<br/>
same sort of thing that led some of the earliest American boxers to<br/>
give up the name and call their hunts "treasure boxing" or something<br/>
like that.  So perhaps it's US who should lay down our pride, and<br/>
change the name of what WE do.  I don't know.  (And don't get me<br/>
started about how I think there's a parallel here with current<br/>
Christianity...but I digress a LOT.)<br/>

"And this all comes back to all the publicity that so many people<br/>
thought was just honky dory."<br/>
<br/>
I still don't agree with this, because it was through a newspaper<br/>
article that I discovered letterboxing.  Because it was in 2004, the<br/>
article led me to letterboxing.org.  And I learned to box from the<br/>
people who were then big on that site.  (Those were the days when<br/>
Mapsurfer clues were still listed there.)  The rub is that current<br/>
publicity probably leads most people to AQ, and when you discover that<br/>
as the current face of the hobby, you learn how to box AQ-style. <br/>
Since many of us (including me) have abandoned that site, new folks<br/>
don't hear our views until later (if ever), and just see us as whiny<br/>
veterans.<br/>

The answer?  Oh, if I knew that, I'd bottle it and sell it.<br/>

&gt; &gt; Good lord! I used to think AQ was the place to go for gather <br/>
info but <br/>
&gt; just went to check on <br/>
&gt; &gt; Knobles info and was just overwhelmed by the clutter! It has <br/>
lost <br/>
&gt; it's effectivness for me. Not <br/>
&gt; &gt; everything is a gather.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Lori and I are doing laundry today. Do you think I should list it <br/>
on <br/>
&gt; AQ just in case somebody is in the area and will want to hook up <br/>
to do <br/>
&gt; an exchange? I'd hate for one of the idiots to miss out on this <br/>
great <br/>
&gt; opportunity.<br/>

&gt; Oh, that's good!  But no, I'm afraid it's pretty much the same as what I told Cyclonic <br/>
when HE proposed a Doing-My-Laundry gathering: sweetie, nobody wants to come to <br/>
that.  Ew.<br/>
