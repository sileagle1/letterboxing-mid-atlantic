learned about boxing but if you hadn't seen the article, that would have <br/>

accidental discovery online like I learned about it.<br/>
<br/>
Actually since I don't look at the articles, etc, I don't know where they <br/>
point people. I didn't think they got pointed them anywhere. I found it in <br/>
2004 also. I think we wre lucky that things were different then.<br/>

<br/>
I still don't agree with this, because it was through a newspaper<br/>
article that I discovered letterboxing. Because it was in 2004, the<br/>
article led me to letterboxing.org. And I learned to box from the<br/>
people who were then big on that site. (Those were the days when<br/>
Mapsurfer clues were still listed there.) The rub is that current<br/>
publicity probably leads most people to AQ, and when you discover that<br/>
as the current face of the hobby, you learn how to box AQ-style.<br/>
Since many of us (including me) have abandoned that site, new folks<br/>
don't hear our views until later (if ever), and just see us as whiny<br/>
veterans.<br/>
<br/>
The answer? Oh, if I knew that, I'd bottle it and sell it.<br/>
