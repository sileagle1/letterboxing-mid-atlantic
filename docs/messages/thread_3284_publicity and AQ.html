I still don't agree with this, because it was through a newspaper<br/>
article that I discovered letterboxing.  Because it was in 2004, the<br/>
article led me to <a href="http://letterboxing.org" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">letterboxing.org</a>.  And I learned to box from the<br/>
people who were then big on that site.  (Those were the days when<br/>
Mapsurfer clues were still listed there.)  The rub is that current<br/>
publicity probably leads most people to AQ, and when you discover that<br/>
as the current face of the hobby, you learn how to box AQ-style. <br/>
Since many of us (including me) have abandoned that site, new folks<br/>
don't hear our views until later (if ever), and just see us as whiny<br/>
veterans.<br/>
<br/>
The answer?  Oh, if I knew that, I'd bottle it and sell it.<br/>

&gt; &gt; OT: Science isn't about knowing the answer<br/>
&gt; beforehand - if you<br/>
&gt; always knew the answer beforehand, it wouldn't be much<br/>
&gt; of an answer. <br/>
&gt; Science is about constructing falsifiable hypotheses and<br/>
&gt; research<br/>
&gt; designs that can be replicated by others.<br/>
&gt; &gt;  <br/>
&gt; &gt; Back on topic: one way to test this would be a content<br/>
&gt; analysis of<br/>
&gt; randomly selected articles about letterboxing.  The devil<br/>
&gt; lies in the<br/>
&gt; detail of the selection, because otherwise there will be an<br/>
&gt; obvious<br/>
&gt; bias built into your results.  I don't care enough<br/>
&gt; about the answer to<br/>
&gt; do the work.<br/>

&gt; &gt; Actually, that was an assumption on my part, made<br/>
&gt; because (from my<br/>
&gt; &gt; vantage point, at least) AQ seems to me to be a lot<br/>
&gt; more busy these<br/>
&gt; &gt; days than letterboxing. org. But I very well might be<br/>
&gt; wrong. <br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; Which would completely invalidate my conclusions.<br/>
&gt; I'd make a terrible<br/>
&gt; &gt; scientist.<br/>

&gt; &gt; &gt; I haven't read anything recently about<br/>
&gt; letterboxing other than the<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; newsgroups; is AQ really the site most publicity<br/>
&gt; refers people to<br/>
&gt; these<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; days?<br/>

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I still don't agree with this, because<br/>
&gt; it was through a newspaper<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; article that I discovered letterboxing.<br/>
&gt; Because it was in 2004, the<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; article led me to letterboxing. org. And I<br/>
&gt; learned to box from the<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; people who were then big on that site.<br/>
&gt; (Those were the days when<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Mapsurfer clues were still listed there.)<br/>
&gt; The rub is that current<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; publicity probably leads most people to AQ,<br/>
&gt; and when you<br/>
&gt; discover that<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; as the current face of the hobby, you learn<br/>
&gt; how to box AQ-style.<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Since many of us (including me) have<br/>
&gt; abandoned that site, new folks<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; don't hear our views until later (if<br/>
&gt; ever), and just see us as whiny<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; veterans.<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; The answer? Oh, if I knew that, I'd<br/>
&gt; bottle it and sell it.<br/>
