experience comes from bad judgement.  The modern addendum is that <br/>
bad experiences become good stories, or at least blog posts.<br/>
<br/>
Twice, I've been on Adirondack summits at the time of pop-up <br/>
thunderstorms.  When you're standing on the highest point for some 3 <br/>
miles in any direction and there are 2/10ths of a mile of bare rock <br/>
face, begging to become a sliding board, between you and tree line, <br/>
it's amazing how fast you can move.<br/>
<br/>
It also changes your perspective on where you need to park at the <br/>
mall on a cloudy day.  "Wet" looks pretty good when you've <br/>
contemplated "wet yet crispy."  :)<br/>
