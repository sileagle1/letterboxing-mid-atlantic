the rest. But the game came to me at a point in time when I so <br/>

There are elements of AQ that I have absolutely no use for, but there <br/>
are features that I think are great and I would hate to lose. The <br/>
letterboxing population is growing and different niches are evolving. <br/>
I do all I can to support and promote the niches that interest me. <br/>
(example Pub Crawls and mysteries) Maybe someday there will be enough <br/>
people with interests similar to mine that we will have our own <br/>
website. I would even pay for such a website. In the mean time viva <br/>
le difference. My 2 cents.<br/>

I've seen him vehemently defend the type of pre-AQ letterboxing I <br/>
have grown to love. He did not falter in his argument to not give up <br/>
the fight. Even though he was almost shouted down he never gave an <br/>

Best disagreement I've had the pleasure to observe in a loooong <br/>
time.  You go boy!  LOL<br/>
