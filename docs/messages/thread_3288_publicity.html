<br/>
This is the thing I don't get in the whole discussion of AQ and <br/>
publicity and what not. When folks first start letterboxing, where do <br/>
they go first? What site comes up first on every search engine? Some <br/>
folks don't find out about AQ until long after they have started boxing, <br/>
they use letterboxing.org. While there is much on AQ that has nothing to <br/>
do with letterboxing, and much that I would be happy to see just thrown <br/>
in the trash heap, and many members there that are a bunch of idiots, I <br/>
am not ready to throw the site under the bus.<br/>
<br/>
What I do like about the site is the search vehicle that is used, it is <br/>
much easier to find boxes, to narrow searches, ect then on <br/>
letterboxing.org. If I had just that ability I would be happy as a clam. <br/>
Also, Ryan does seem to at least respond to user concerns, which is much <br/>
more then I can say Chio and company over at letterboxing.org. That is <br/>
why I use AQ and not letterboxing.org.<br/>
<br/>
And, because of that, that is why my boxes tend to get fewer finders <br/>
then many other area boxes. Not because they are harder, some are very <br/>
straight forward and meant for the new boxer, but because the clues are <br/>
not listed on letterboxing.org. If you want to keep new boxers from <br/>
finding your boxes, in my experience, listing on just AQ will do just that.<br/>
<br/>
As for the publicity aspect, those that say it will be the ruin of <br/>
letterboxing are full of it (sorry June, not pointing fingers, just <br/>
saying). The hobby got started in the US because of a magazine article, <br/>
and now bears little resemblance to its British cousin. There are a load <br/>
of boxers that found out about it by reading of it in places like Family <br/>
Fun and they are great people, and plant great boxes. I have never found <br/>
any correlation between news articles and the destruction of boxes. <br/>
People just don't do it. Sure, you get folks that go out there, think it <br/>
is great fun, and don't rehide well, ect, ect, but that is going to <br/>
happen no matter what, and has happened since the beginning.<br/>
<br/>
That's my $2 worth.<br/>

<br/>
As arguably the most obnoxiously vocal advocate of avoiding publicity for the game, I will <br/>
once again stand for the pasting.<br/>
<br/>
My position against publicity is to urge letterboxers to show restraint when dealing with <br/>
the press.  I am not arguing for silence, just thoughtful restraint.<br/>
<br/>
My biggest concern is not that we will get a flood of 'noxers trashing the boxes.  My <br/>
concern is that we currently operate under the radar of the managers of most parks and <br/>
recreation areas where we "play."  We benefit from a benign neglect because we - in <br/>
general - have been respectful in our operation.<br/>
<br/>
It is my belief however, that if the profile of letterboxing ever reaches a national or <br/>
regional consciousness level (what people in publicity call a tipping point) park managers <br/>
will be forced to decide to either permit or ban letterboxing.  <br/>
<br/>
What do you think most will decide?  What was decided by the National Parks?  Do you <br/>
think most responsible land managers will opt for allowing unrestricted dumping of <br/>
unsupervised plasticware in their park?<br/>
<br/>
So I advocate restraint.  Go ahead, talk to your local Boy Scout troop or hold a seminar at <br/>
the local crafts club. Tell your friends.   A camping magazine calls?  Fine - talk to them.  <br/>
The local shopper?  You bet. <br/>
<br/>
But if the Philadelphia Inquirer or Newsweek calls, I would respectfully suggest you think <br/>
twice.  The story you tell them might not be the story they print.<br/>
<br/>
As someone who has worked in the media for over 20 years I can tell you I have seen a <br/>
number of "happy puff pieces" become "threat or menace" pieces on a slow news day.<br/>
<br/>
I have respectfully requested that digphilly.com remove my copyrighted material from <br/>
their web site.  Not because I am afraid of a horde of proto-boxers, but because it is mine <br/>
and if I don't want it on AQ, I certainly don't want it on diggphilly.com<br/>

&gt;&gt;&gt;       <br/>
&gt; letterboxing are full of it (sorry June, not pointing fingers, just<br/>
&gt; saying). The hobby got started in the US because of a magazine article,&lt;&lt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; As arguably the most obnoxiously vocal advocate of avoiding publicity for the game, I will <br/>
&gt; once again stand for the pasting.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; My position against publicity is to urge letterboxers to show restraint when dealing with <br/>
&gt; the press.  I am not arguing for silence, just thoughtful restraint.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;   <br/>
<br/>
</span></blockquote>You, I totally agree with you there. (didn't see that one coming, did you?)<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; My biggest concern is not that we will get a flood of 'noxers trashing the boxes.  My <br/>
&gt; concern is that we currently operate under the radar of the managers of most parks and <br/>
&gt; recreation areas where we "play."  We benefit from a benign neglect because we - in <br/>
&gt; general - have been respectful in our operation.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; It is my belief however, that if the profile of letterboxing ever reaches a national or <br/>
&gt; regional consciousness level (what people in publicity call a tipping point) park managers <br/>
&gt; will be forced to decide to either permit or ban letterboxing.  <br/>
&gt;   <br/>
<br/>
</span></blockquote>Where is that point though. Geocaching, which does essentially the same <br/>
thing, is possibly as much as ten times larger then letterboxing, and <br/>
while on the radar of some managers, many still seem to ignore it <br/>
because it still does not do much damage. I am not saying that that will <br/>
always be the case, but it keeps growing too. The NPS is a special case, <br/>
because while the rangers and the parks people are great, the folks at <br/>
the top are idiots.<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; What do you think most will decide?  What was decided by the National Parks?  Do you <br/>
&gt; think most responsible land managers will opt for allowing unrestricted dumping of <br/>
&gt; unsupervised plasticware in their park?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; So I advocate restraint.  Go ahead, talk to your local Boy Scout troop or hold a seminar at <br/>
&gt; the local crafts club. Tell your friends.   A camping magazine calls?  Fine - talk to them.  <br/>
&gt; The local shopper?  You bet. <br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; But if the Philadelphia Inquirer or Newsweek calls, I would respectfully suggest you think <br/>
&gt; twice.  The story you tell them might not be the story they print.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; As someone who has worked in the media for over 20 years I can tell you I have seen a <br/>
&gt; number of "happy puff pieces" become "threat or menace" pieces on a slow news day.<br/>
&gt;   <br/>
<br/>
</span></blockquote>Actually, I did help with a piece for the Inquirer, and it came out <br/>
great. You have to communicate with folks a bit first, get a feel for <br/>
them, which I did. The reporter was willing to come out and learn by <br/>
actually doing, which I felt was important, and he asked me more <br/>
questions then I could ever even think of. He really wanted to know what <br/>
letterboxing is, in and out, and that is all the difference.<br/>
<br/>
I have had others contact me and ask me things that I felt they were <br/>
just working on a puff piece, so I respectfully say no thanks.<br/>
<br/>
Not looking for fame, I am looking to do the right thing. They are going <br/>
to write about it no matter what, might as well help them have the facts <br/>
and important points straight.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; I have respectfully requested that digphilly.com remove my copyrighted material from <br/>

by the actions of the geocacheing community.  Add their publicity to ours when you try to <br/>
figure out where the tipping point is.<br/>
<br/>
The big downside of the tipping point for us is that it is a bell that can't be un-rung.  The <br/>
tipping point is the straw that breaks the camel's back.  After that, we're outlaws.  There <br/>
are idiots at the top of any political organization - like a town council or county <br/>
commission.    They will make their decision and we will have to live with it.<br/>

Some schools outlawed dodgeball.<br/>

harm, no foul right?  Right?  Are you sure?<br/>
BTW- I wasn't picking on you when I mentioned the Inquirer.  It was just an example.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;  They are going to write about it no matter what, might as well help them have the facts <br/>
&gt; and important points straight.<br/>
<br/>
</span></blockquote>With all due respect, that is the line they teach reporters in journalism school to use to get <br/>
people to cooperate.    "You want people to hear your side of the story, right? You killed all <br/>
those people for a reason!"  It's a puff piece.  If enough people say "no thank you" they will <br/>
move on to easier pickings in the world of outdoor recreation.  It's not the Lindbergh baby <br/>
- oh, I'm showing my age - It's not Lindsay Lohan.  They won't pursue it like hounds.  <br/>
<br/>
I am reminded of Scarab's story of working with the Time magazine reporter on their <br/>
letterboxing piece.  He was also lucky in that the reporter let him review the piece before <br/>
printing.  One of his boxes was described as being near the entrance to the U.S. State <br/>
Department.  I don't know if you all remember what the climate was like in America right <br/>
after 9-11, but a hidden box outside the U.S. State department would certainly have <br/>
raised some eyebrows.  Scarab successfully convinced the reporter to change the <br/>
description of the location.  What if he hadn't?  Not the end, I'm sure, but another 2 inches <br/>
closer to the radar, perhaps.<br/>
<br/>
When I was a kid they invented this cool game called Dungeons and Dragons.  Yes.  I <br/>
admit it.  I was a D&amp;D geek.  But goldarnit I was a pioneering D&amp;D geek!  A few years after <br/>
it was invented, a couple of college kids went missing in Texas and it was blamed on <br/>
playing D&amp;D.  Then Pat Robertson piled on claiming it was a pathway to Satanism so he <br/>
could hit up his flock for more cash.  Next thing you know, graph paper and multi-sided <br/>
dice were banned at my high school and many others across the country.  No D&amp;D in <br/>
school.<br/>
<br/>
It happens that fast.  It doesn't take a very creative mind to see how our little thing could <br/>
be perceived as dangerous to kids or dangerous to the environment or dangerous to <br/>
public safety by those who should have better things to do.<br/>
<br/>
Perhaps I should ask what we gain by publicity.  Do we need to be preaching this gospel?  <br/>
Sure I want more boxes.  We all do.<br/>
<br/>
But what is wrong with steady controlled growth?  It's good for forests, why not <br/>
letterboxing?  Word-of-mouth, person-to-person or person to small groups can help <br/>
improve the quality of letterboxing for everyone.  You get people who are involved in <br/>
perpetuating the traditions and mores of the game - People like you and me and most of <br/>
the fine folks here on LBMA.<br/>
<br/>
This is why I urge restraint.</div>

activities.  <br/>
<br/>
The part I don't understand is this... If you put clues on the <br/>
internet, you can expect someone can/may link to them.  Unless you <br/>
have a private blog, word of mouth or another gatekeeping mechanism, <br/>
you can expect your clues are available to anyone online.  Millions <br/>
of people have illegally downloaded music, copied images and written <br/>
words.  How can one think their clues are quasi private on the <br/>
internet?  If the law can't prevent people from copying and linking, <br/>
courtesy and decorum surely won't.  We often speak of ways to make <br/>
our clues limited(talk of the con really got this going for us).  We <br/>
have been unable to agree on how we can make our clues accessible <br/>
but limiting without causing a lot more work for ourselves, or <br/>
limiting the clues too much that no one finds our boxes, so for now <br/>
they continue to be available online and open for all, including <br/>
those who choose to link to them...unfortunately.</div>

"Let me understand this, you are upset because a box you left in a <br/>
public place with clues to find it posted on a public forum was found <br/>
by a member of the public?  Really what it boils down to is that we <br/>
are all littering, you can claim that it is different because you are <br/>
going back to that site and pick it up someday, but I was really <br/>
meaning to pick up that hamburger wrapper someday when it blows by my <br/>
front yard.  I just get really annoyed when people have unrealistic <br/>
expectations of the public. Check out the gene pool at the DMV.  Lower <br/>
your expectations when dealing with public, you will seldom be <br/>
disappointed and sometimes surprised.  If you are truly concerned make <br/>
your hides harder." <br/>

I assume you are the Fishman in the video on that stupid website I <br/>
just heard about and looked at? There's a link to the eastern pa page <br/>
on lbna. What makes you think all of those people want their boxes <br/>
put out there for the whole frigging world to see??!!! <br/>
<br/>
Do what you want with your own boxes but leave other people out of <br/>
it. You have NO control over what these people write or what they do. <br/>
There are a LOT of people in this hobby who do NOT want their boxes <br/>
put out there like that. <br/>

You just had to get your 15 minutes of frigging fame didn't you? <br/>

I should also post my response:<br/>
<br/>
You need to calm yourself right now and stop ASSUMING things! I have <br/>
NO idea what the hell you're talking about!<br/>
<br/>
I'm probably one of the more underground boxers out there. <br/>
I "regularly" e-mail MAYBE 2 other boxers in this area. I don't <br/>
attend any group events. <br/>
<br/>
I plant my own boxes and respect others peoples boxes as I would want <br/>
mine respected! If there's a torn bag, I'll replace it with an extra <br/>
I have. If there's a damp log book, I'll send a message to the <br/>
planter telling them it needs some maintenance. When I came across <br/>
the location of Sheba's "Red Herron" I found the stamp torn in 4 <br/>
pieces, the log book in 2 pieces, both scattered into the woods about <br/>
15 feet. I glued and remounted the stamp, fixed the logbook and <br/>
contacted Sheba to let her know I had it. She GRATEFULLY came and <br/>
picked the box up from me.<br/>
<br/>
SO, before you jump out there WRONGFULLY accusing people of doing <br/>
things, get your damn facts straight!<br/>
<br/>
Fishman<br/>
<br/>
Ok, was my response a little harsh . . . yes.  Unwarranted?  I don't <br/>
think so.  I've seen Miss Moon logged into many of the boxes I've <br/>
found.  Until today I ASSUMED her to be a respectable boxer.  Once <br/>
again, look what assuming gets you!<br/>
<br/>
She flys off the handle accusing ME of writing/posting that article <br/>
and/or video.  That is NOT me in the video!  That's not me filming <br/>
the video!  I had NOTHING to do with the video!  What, did she ASSUME <br/>
that b/c the clues to one of my letterboxes happened to appear right <br/>
after the video link, that I must have had something to do with it?!  <br/>
I didn't even know about the article/video until AFTER her <br/>
accusation! No one ever contacted me or asked permission to post my <br/>
clues.  Nor do they need to, as someone posted out, they're posted to <br/>
a public website!<br/>
<br/>
As I stated, I think I've been quite respectful of people's <br/>
letterboxes and the hobby in general.  Until today I've only had one <br/>
minor issue with another boxer.<br/>
<br/>
So Miss Moon I want to thank you for helping me celebrate my 200th <br/>
find today by having to defend myself to your ignorant existence!<br/>
<br/>
Fishman<br/>
<br/>
P.S. I've had more than my share of 15 minutes of fame and it's a <br/>
hell of a lot better than a poorly made youtube video that any old <br/>
bloke can post for their own self-righteous egos!   <br/>

&gt; limiting the clues too much that no one finds our boxes, so for now <br/>

What makes anyone think a posting of clues on a public site won't be<br/>
linked?  People don't even seal baggies, you think they are going to<br/>
follow some "letterboxing decorum" and not link to publicly posted<br/>
clues?  To post something public and then whine about the publicity<br/>
makes no sense.  Wake up!  News organizations do it all of the time,<br/>
and yes it is considered acceptable.  Think of all the<br/>
MySpace/Facebook pages shown on the news of people after they have<br/>
committed a crime.  Now they are making money on that too!<br/>

question, I've always liked this article, simply as a<br/>
way of thinking about the question --<br/>
<br/>
<a href="http://www.templetons.com/brad/linkright.html" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.templetons.com/brad/linkright.html</a><br/>
<br/>
It is a very old article, and no doubt more modern case<br/>
law and articles have been written since, but there it is,<br/>
FWIW.<br/>
<br/>
My personal opinion is that the owners of web content<br/>
should have some rights to say how it is used, that<br/>
is -- just because this medium happens to allow an<br/>
intellectual property free-for-all, doesn't mean it<br/>
should.  I think that is an artefact of the technology,<br/>
not the intent.<br/>
<br/>
It would be nice if people were simply courteous on these<br/>
matters and respected the IP owners' wishes, regardless of<br/>
whether it is legal or not.  One thing that seems clear<br/>
about the article I link to above -- the IP owner must make<br/>
it clear that they do not wish to be linked to in the<br/>
first place.<br/>
<br/>

internet. It is when a published material is reprinted without <br/>
permission that that things go bad. Had the website contacted Pete and <br/>
Dave and asked permission to reprint their clues, and had it been given, <br/>
then everything would be fine, but that is not what happened. Even if it <br/>
had been reprinted on a personal site it would then fall under the <br/>
guidelines of the fair use act, but again that is not what was done here.<br/>
<br/>
News outlets get permission to reprint things, and they properly <br/>
attribute them.<br/>

<br/>
In my case, it was not a link.  They copied my clue and published to the web on their site.<br/>
Their site sells advertising and is therefore a commercial site using my intellectual <br/>
property for profit without permission.  That is not covered by "Fair Use" protection of the <br/>
Copyright Act.  The clue is not used in a news story as defined by the law as relevent to <br/>
current events, nor is it used in a review.  Those exceptions are made in copyright law.<br/>
That is not the case here.<br/>
<br/>
My copyright exists as soon as I publish whether I put a little c. next to it or not.  I do have <br/>
a copyright page on my site explaining my exclusive rights to the material contained on <br/>
the site.<br/>
<br/>
Materials used by the general public on Facebook and MySpace are for non-commmercial <br/>
purposes.  In the exceptions where the material is used for commercial promotional <br/>
purposes, the materials are copyrighted by the owner or given clearance before <br/>
publication.  MySpace and FaceBook are also involved in ongoing copyright litigation over <br/>
these matters.<br/>
<br/>
Most of the law regarding intellectual property has yet to be written.  The technology - as <br/>
usual - has outpaced the law.  What the law will be in the future will be decided by what <br/>
we decide is acceptable today.  If we take an "everybody's doing it" attitude there will be no <br/>
copyright protection for anyone - except those with pockets deep enough to drag you into <br/>
court.<br/>
<br/>
I am not suing diggphilly.com.  I am requesting they remove my material from their site.  <br/>
If they refuse, I will have a discussion with them.  If they still refuse I will have a <br/>
discussion with their advertisers.  I find that is most effective - much more so for a small <br/>
outfit like diggphilly who won't like their advertisers bothered.  I might also buttonhole the <br/>
owner at the next Philly Ad Club meeting and explain in front of his peers that he is using <br/>
copyrighted material illegally.  That should go over pretty big.  <br/>
<br/>
I may even recruit some fellow letterboxers who agree with me to call and express their <br/>
distress at these matters to diggphilly or their advertisers.  Any volunteers?<br/>
<br/>
I can't control what happens to the plastic litter I leave in the woods once I leave it there.  <br/>
In the grand tradition of the ridiculous pollution credits developed by industry, I clean up <br/>
more trash from the environment than I leave.  <br/>
<br/>
And yes, I often violate property owners rights by hiding letterboxes on private property.  <br/>
(like my new one- Wm. Penn which is on private property ceded for public use)  So my <br/>
hands are unclean.  I am not without sin.  I am just fighting back on this one.<br/>

&gt; &gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; The part I don't understand is this... If you put clues on the <br/>

&gt; &gt; &gt; have a private blog, word of mouth or another gatekeeping mechanism, <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; you can expect your clues are available to anyone online.  Millions <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; of people have illegally downloaded music, copied images and written <br/>

&gt; &gt; Exactly which law is broken when someone links your public posting?  <br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; What makes anyone think a posting of clues on a public site won't be<br/>
&gt; &gt; linked?  People don't even seal baggies, you think they are going to<br/>
&gt; &gt; follow some "letterboxing decorum" and not link to publicly posted<br/>
&gt; &gt; clues?  To post something public and then whine about the publicity<br/>
&gt; &gt; makes no sense.  Wake up!  News organizations do it all of the time,<br/>
&gt; &gt; and yes it is considered acceptable.  Think of all the<br/>
&gt; &gt; MySpace/Facebook pages shown on the news of people after they have<br/>
&gt; &gt; committed a crime.  Now they are making money on that too!<br/>

Part of the fun of this box and what makes it so special for me is <br/>
that we had to figure out the location and it happened to be that we <br/>
actually stumbled upon it after a long day of less than fruitful <br/>
boxing.  It was just the treat to soothe our scorned souls that day--<br/>
and a cool place to boot.  Hell, it's practically a drive by now.<br/>

Work has been hell and thankfully it was broken up by a nice <br/>
Carribean cruise were the family and I planted 3 boxes (I couldn't <br/>
resist) but now it was back to work again. As far as the controversy <br/>
here - or seeming controversy...I'd have to say that I agree with a <br/>
lot of the comments here.  The trouble is that I agree with opposing <br/>
ones...  ;)   I didn't really like the Youtube video - but I myself <br/>
learned of letterboxing from a Family Fun article about 3 years ago - <br/>
so who am I to cast stones...   But, the difference to me is that I <br/>
took to LB'ing like an old soul as soon as I got my feet wet. I <br/>
respected the history (and researched it extensively) and then I <br/>
practiced good LB'ing habits -lest I not be able to preach them to <br/>
others ;)  I often find that I agree with Brian's viewpoint (TGD) but <br/>
then also with Nathan's.  Since I have met you both I can see that <br/>
you practice what you preach as well.  While there are some parts of <br/>
AQ that I don't use, I like other parts and when I met Ryan at <br/>
Nathan's gather - I could see that he was also a 'good guy' as well <br/>
as everyone else I have met through LB'ing.  He does not seem like <br/>
the evil twin of LB'ing who only wants your $$ as some people often <br/>
say he is.  I think he does a good job in general - so a few months <br/>
back - he got more of my $.  :-)  I have yet to meet Randy but that <br/>
will probably happen eventually and I'm sure I'll see that there are <br/>
reasons why I agree with his viewpoints also (and spend so many <br/>
friggin hours looking for his boxes!).  And that's just the thing,  <br/>
it's not that hard to find parts of everyone's viewpoint here that <br/>
can be agreed with.  If we weren't all somewhat like minded in <br/>
general - when it comes to letterboxing, this discussion would <br/>
probably not be going on.  There is a certain amount of 'caring' that <br/>
the people have here towards this hobby (obsession) of ours.  It is <br/>
those 'other' people who trample all over the hobby, or mangle boxes <br/>
assuming they are geo-junk, or in general just don't take the time to <br/>
bother to see what LB'ing is all about - those are the people (I <br/>
think of them as LB frauds) that usually cause the problems that we <br/>
rant about. Now, although there may be some disagreements here - I <br/>
don't believe we have any Letterbox-frauds in this venue.  <br/>
Although...I could be mistaken...  ;)  On another note, we found <br/>
Otis' Friends "Fearsome Fish" today. After a marathon day of family <br/>
adventure and driving all over New Jersey, we finally wound up <br/>
snagging that recently planted little gem.  Thanks - John<br/>

  completely<br/>&gt; unjustified,<br/>&gt; but all the same, I'd just prefer that 
  letterboxers run<br/>&gt; letterboxing<br/>&gt; websites.<br/>&gt; <br/>&gt; &gt; 
  It seems like speculation that it would have been<br/>&gt; "worse", but 
  it<br/>&gt; &gt; does seem at least a tacit suggestion that AQ went in<br/>&gt; 
  a direction<br/>&gt; &gt; where such a comparative is appropriate.<br/>&gt; 
  <br/>&gt; It is speculation. I'd offer hard facts if I could, but<br/>&gt; 
  fortunately,<br/>&gt; the "worse" never happened--well, except for<br/>&gt; 
  those folks who consider<br/>&gt; AQ being "worse." &gt;<br/>&gt; <br/>&gt; &gt; 
  I'll tear down the old growth forest and build a<br/>&gt; shopping<br/>&gt; &gt; 
  mall, so the guy down the street doesn't and build<br/>&gt; a strip 
  mall.<br/>&gt; <br/>&gt; Now that's not really a fair comparison either, since 
  I<br/>&gt; never had to<br/>&gt; tear down an old growth forest to build Atlas 
  Quest.<br/>&gt; Letterboxing. org<br/>&gt; is still has more users, still 
  gets most the credit in<br/>&gt; newspapers and<br/>&gt; magazine articles. LbNA 
  still exists, and probably will<br/>&gt; continue to<br/>&gt; thrive just fine 
  for many decades to come.<br/>&gt; <br/>&gt; In the virtual world, you don't 
  have to tear down<br/>&gt; something old to<br/>&gt; start something 
  new.<br/>&gt; <br/>&gt; &gt; And what could Grounded, Inc., have done that 
  is<br/>&gt; "worse" than<br/>&gt; &gt; LTCs? :)<br/>&gt; <br/>&gt; I didn't invent 
  LTCs. I just gave them a place to play<br/>&gt; where I don't<br/>&gt; have see 
  them. =)<br/>&gt; <br/>&gt; &gt; "Hypocrite" isn't the right word, but<br/>&gt; 
  you were an aggressive<br/>&gt; &gt; detractor (remember the Fright Fest (tm), 
  for example<br/>&gt; :-);<br/>&gt; <br/>&gt; True. It was a very, very bad 
  website. =) <br/>&gt; <br/>&gt; &gt; So, its a big hassle for everyone, 
  tracking,<br/>&gt; &gt; listing, etc., on two sites; and what economic 
  benefit<br/>&gt; is derived<br/>&gt; &gt; from that waste?<br/>&gt; <br/>&gt; 
  Well, I'm not all that thrilled tracking stuff on two<br/>&gt; 
  different<br/>&gt; websites. It's rather inconvenient, and I would have<br/>&gt; 
  loved to have<br/>&gt; merged the clues on LbNA with those on AQ (even more 
  so<br/>&gt; early on when<br/>&gt; there was practically nothing listed on AQ in 
  the first<br/>&gt; place), but<br/>&gt; that idea didn't seem like it would 
  anywhere.<br/>&gt; <br/>&gt; But hey, if you can make it happen on the LbNA end 
  of<br/>&gt; things, I'd be<br/>&gt; absolutely thrilled to develop a system 
  where LbNA can do<br/>&gt; more talking<br/>&gt; with Atlas Quest, so if the 
  status of a box is changed on<br/>&gt; one site,<br/>&gt; the other site can 
  automatically be notified of the change<br/>&gt; and have<br/>&gt; the change 
  happen there. That sort of stuff would be<br/>&gt; enormously useful<br/>&gt; 
  for everyone, or to make it easier for people to list boxes<br/>&gt; on 
  both<br/>&gt; sites simultaneously. But I didn't see that idea<br/>&gt; getting 
  off the ground.<br/>&gt; <br/>&gt; Things could definitely be more efficient, 
  though.<br/>&gt; <br/>&gt; -- Ryan<br/><br/></p></div><span style="COLOR:white;"></span>

&gt; build a<br/>
&gt; &gt; shopping<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;  mall, so the guy down the street doesn't and<br/>
&gt; build<br/>
&gt; &gt; a strip  mall.<br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; Now that's not really a fair comparison either,<br/>
&gt; since  I<br/>
&gt; &gt; never had to<br/>
&gt; &gt; tear down an old growth forest to build Atlas  Quest.<br/>
&gt; &gt; Letterboxing. Le<br/>
&gt; &gt; is still has more users, still  gets most the credit<br/>
&gt; in<br/>
&gt; &gt; newspapers and<br/>
&gt; &gt; magazine articles. LbNA  still exists, and probably<br/>
&gt; will<br/>
&gt; &gt; continue to<br/>
&gt; &gt; thrive just fine  for many decades to come.<br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; In the virtual world, you don't  have to tear down<br/>
&gt; &gt; something old to<br/>
&gt; &gt; start something  new.<br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; And what could Grounded, Inc., have done that  is<br/>
&gt; &gt; "worse" than<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; LTCs? :)<br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; I didn't invent  LTCs. I just gave them a place to<br/>
&gt; play<br/>
&gt; &gt; where I don't<br/>
&gt; &gt; have see  them. =)<br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; "Hypocrite" isn't the right word,<br/>
&gt; but<br/>
&gt; &gt;  you were an aggressive<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; detractor (remember the Fright Fest (tm),  for<br/>
&gt; example<br/>
&gt; &gt; :-);<br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; True. It was a very, very bad  website. =) <br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; So, its a big hassle for everyone,  tracking,<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; listing, etc., on two sites; and what economic <br/>
&gt; benefit<br/>
&gt; &gt; is derived<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; from that waste?<br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt;  Well, I'm not all that thrilled tracking stuff on<br/>
&gt; two<br/>
&gt; &gt;  different<br/>
&gt; &gt; websites. It's rather inconvenient, and I would<br/>
&gt; have<br/>
&gt; &gt;  loved to have<br/>
&gt; &gt; merged the clues on LbNA with those on AQ (even more <br/>
&gt; so<br/>
&gt; &gt; early on when<br/>
&gt; &gt; there was practically nothing listed on AQ in  the<br/>
&gt; first<br/>
&gt; &gt; place), but<br/>
&gt; &gt; that idea didn't seem like it would  anywhere.<br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; But hey, if you can make it happen on the LbNA end  of<br/>
&gt; &gt; things, I'd be<br/>
&gt; &gt; absolutely thrilled to develop a system  where LbNA<br/>
&gt; can do<br/>
&gt; &gt; more talking<br/>
&gt; &gt; with Atlas Quest, so if the  status of a box is<br/>
&gt; changed on<br/>
&gt; &gt; one site,<br/>
&gt; &gt; the other site can  automatically be notified of the<br/>
&gt; change<br/>
&gt; &gt; and have<br/>
&gt; &gt; the change  happen there. That sort of stuff would be<br/>
&gt; &gt; enormously useful<br/>
&gt; &gt;  for everyone, or to make it easier for people to list<br/>
&gt; boxes<br/>
&gt; &gt; on  both<br/>
&gt; &gt; sites simultaneously. But I didn't see that idea<br/>
&gt; &gt; getting  off the ground.<br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; Things could definitely be more efficient,  though.<br/>

&gt; &gt; &gt;  Date: Tuesday, August 5, 2008, 5:56 PM<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I'd have been  appalled if they<br/>
&gt; &gt; developed a<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; "letterboxing" <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;  website, <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Why?<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; Just a personal  opinion. I like letterboxing, not<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; geocaching, and<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; would prefer  that the two stay separate. Probably the<br/>
&gt; &gt; same<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; reason most<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;  geocachers wouldn't want me messing with the<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; geocaching.com  website.<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; I'd probably encourage less use of the GPS and to <br/>
&gt; &gt; stop<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; with all the<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; toys. Probably make an icon so people would  know when<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; there's "art" in<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; the box instead of dumb little  toys. =)<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; Now, I will admit, my fears could be wrong and <br/>
&gt; &gt; completely<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; unjustified,<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; but all the same, I'd just prefer that <br/>
&gt; &gt; letterboxers run<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; letterboxing<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; websites.<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;  It seems like speculation that it would have<br/>
&gt; &gt; been<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; "worse", but  it<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; does seem at least a tacit suggestion that AQ<br/>
&gt; &gt; went in<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;  a direction<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; where such a comparative is appropriate.<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;  <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; It is speculation. I'd offer hard facts if I<br/>
&gt; &gt; could, but<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;  fortunately,<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; the "worse" never happened--well, except for<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;  those folks who consider<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; AQ being "worse." &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;  I'll tear down the old growth forest and<br/>

  geocachers wouldn't want me messing with the<br/>&gt; &gt; geocaching.com 
  website.<br/>&gt; &gt; I'd probably encourage less use of the GPS and to 
  <br/>&gt; stop<br/>&gt; &gt; with all the<br/>&gt; &gt; toys. Probably make an 
  icon so people would know when<br/>&gt; &gt; there's "art" in<br/>&gt; &gt; the 
  box instead of dumb little toys. =)<br/>&gt; &gt; <br/>&gt; &gt; Now, I will 
  admit, my fears could be wrong and <br/>&gt; completely<br/>&gt; &gt; 
  unjustified,<br/>&gt; &gt; but all the same, I'd just prefer that <br/>&gt; 
  letterboxers run<br/>&gt; &gt; letterboxing<br/>&gt; &gt; websites.<br/>&gt; &gt; 
  <br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; It seems like speculation that it would have<br/>&gt; 
  been<br/>&gt; &gt; "worse", but it<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; does seem at least a tacit 
  suggestion that AQ<br/>&gt; went in<br/>&gt; &gt; a direction<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; 
  where such a comparative is appropriate.<br/>&gt; &gt; <br/>&gt; &gt; It is 
  speculation. I'd offer hard facts if I<br/>&gt; could, but<br/>&gt; &gt; 
  fortunately,<br/>&gt; &gt; the "worse" never happened--well, except for<br/>&gt; 
  &gt; those folks who consider<br/>&gt; &gt; AQ being "worse." &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; 
  <br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; I'll tear down the old growth forest and<br/>&gt; build 
  a<br/>&gt; &gt; shopping<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; mall, so the guy down the street 
  doesn't and<br/>&gt; build<br/>&gt; &gt; a strip mall.<br/>&gt; &gt; <br/>&gt; 
  &gt; Now that's not really a fair comparison either,<br/>&gt; since I<br/>&gt; 
  &gt; never had to<br/>&gt; &gt; tear down an old growth forest to build Atlas 
  Quest.<br/>&gt; &gt; Letterboxing. Le<br/>&gt; &gt; is still has more users, 
  still gets most the credit<br/>&gt; in<br/>&gt; &gt; newspapers and<br/>&gt; &gt; 
  magazine articles. LbNA still exists, and probably<br/>&gt; will<br/>&gt; &gt; 
  continue to<br/>&gt; &gt; thrive just fine for many decades to come.<br/>&gt; 
  &gt; <br/>&gt; &gt; In the virtual world, you don't have to tear down<br/>&gt; 
  &gt; something old to<br/>&gt; &gt; start something new.<br/>&gt; &gt; <br/>&gt; 
  &gt; &gt; And what could Grounded, Inc., have done that is<br/>&gt; &gt; 
  "worse" than<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; LTCs? :)<br/>&gt; &gt; <br/>&gt; &gt; I didn't 
  invent LTCs. I just gave them a place to<br/>&gt; play<br/>&gt; &gt; where I 
  don't<br/>&gt; &gt; have see them. =)<br/>&gt; &gt; <br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; 
  "Hypocrite" isn't the right word,<br/>&gt; but<br/>&gt; &gt; you were an 
  aggressive<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; detractor (remember the Fright Fest (tm), 
  for<br/>&gt; example<br/>&gt; &gt; :-);<br/>&gt; &gt; <br/>&gt; &gt; True. It was 
  a very, very bad website. =) <br/>&gt; &gt; <br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; So, its a big 
  hassle for everyone, tracking,<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; listing, etc., on two sites; 
  and what economic <br/>&gt; benefit<br/>&gt; &gt; is derived<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; 
  from that waste?<br/>&gt; &gt; <br/>&gt; &gt; Well, I'm not all that thrilled 
  tracking stuff on<br/>&gt; two<br/>&gt; &gt; different<br/>&gt; &gt; websites. 
  It's rather inconvenient, and I would<br/>&gt; have<br/>&gt; &gt; loved to 
  have<br/>&gt; &gt; merged the clues on LbNA with those on AQ (even more 
  <br/>&gt; so<br/>&gt; &gt; early on when<br/>&gt; &gt; there was practically 
  nothing listed on AQ in the<br/>&gt; first<br/>&gt; &gt; place), but<br/>&gt; 
  &gt; that idea didn't seem like it would anywhere.<br/>&gt; &gt; <br/>&gt; &gt; 
  But hey, if you can make it happen on the LbNA end of<br/>&gt; &gt; things, I'd 
  be<br/>&gt; &gt; absolutely thrilled to develop a system where LbNA<br/>&gt; can 
  do<br/>&gt; &gt; more talking<br/>&gt; &gt; with Atlas Quest, so if the status 
  of a box is<br/>&gt; changed on<br/>&gt; &gt; one site,<br/>&gt; &gt; the other 
  site can automatically be notified of the<br/>&gt; change<br/>&gt; &gt; and

  people to list<br/>&gt; boxes<br/>&gt; &gt; on both<br/>&gt; &gt; sites

I, for one, think it's ok for Ryan to defend himself and for Randy to <br/>
counter.  Ryan is a little late to the discussion, however, leaving one <br/>
to wonder what brought that on at this point?  Anyway...<br/>
<br/>
There are many who don't like AQ- don't like how it came about and what <br/>
it's become- and don't like publicity.  Just as Ryan has the obvious <br/>
ability to do with AQ whatever he wants, those who disagree should have <br/>
equal opportunity to bemoan what it represents and what publicity in <br/>
general has done.<br/>
<br/>
Foul? Believe me, I've seen foul, been embroiled in it and have smelled <br/>
of it afterward (can't keep my mouth shut sometimes!). With the <br/>
exception of a little misunderstanding that was worked out between the <br/>
participants, *this* has *not* been foul. lol</div>

not much on it that would interest me. Not like I live in the area. =)<br/>
But sometimes people point me out to interesting things going on where<br/>
I'd otherwise miss it.<br/>
<br/>
For those of you holding a grudge against me from my rather vocal<br/>
dislike of a specific person or website from five years ago, sorry<br/>
about that. I'll admit that I did not handle the situation<br/>
particularly well, but still, that was five years ago. That's a long<br/>
time to be holding a grudge. Surely I can't the only person who's ever<br/>
been young and stupid. =)<br/>

As for posting on accident.... been there, done that. Not a pleasant<br/>
experience.<br/>

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I'd have been  appalled if they<br/>
&gt; &gt; developed a<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; "letterboxing" <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;  website, <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Why?<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; Just a personal  opinion. I like letterboxing, not<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; geocaching, and<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; would prefer  that the two stay separate. Probably the<br/>
&gt; &gt; same<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; reason most<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;  geocachers wouldn't want me messing with the<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; geocaching.com  website.<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; I'd probably encourage less use of the GPS and to <br/>
&gt; &gt; stop<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; with all the<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; toys. Probably make an icon so people would  know when<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; there's "art" in<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; the box instead of dumb little  toys. =)<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; Now, I will admit, my fears could be wrong and <br/>
&gt; &gt; completely<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; unjustified,<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; but all the same, I'd just prefer that <br/>

&gt; &gt; &gt; letterboxing<br/>

&gt; &gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;  It seems like speculation that it would have<br/>

&gt; &gt; &gt; "worse", but  it<br/>
