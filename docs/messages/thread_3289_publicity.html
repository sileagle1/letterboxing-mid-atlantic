<div>I have to chime in on this one!</div>
<div> </div>
<div>I agree with Miss Moon 100%. (now that's something I never thought I'd say!)  :-)</div>
<div>Many of us have had the opportunity to "sing the praises" of our favorite hobby.</div>
<div>But why? Publicity about letterboxing was equated to the following from an enigma from the north:</div>
<div> </div>
<div>"It's like having your own private fishing hole - teaming with fat, plump trout in an idyllic setting. Then you tell your friends about it; who tell other friends, etc. By the next time you return, the fish are gone, the wild flowers are trampled and there is litter all over."</div>
<div> </div>
<div>I see this as almost a generational thing (although age doesn't really enter into this - it's more like the years you've been letterboxing.) Those of us who have been boxing for 3+ years feel differently about bells &amp; whistles and publicity. Those new to this hobby know nothing different than all that Atlas Quest has to offer.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>I was on Atlas Quest several months ago and happened to read a post where Erik Davis was mentioned. "Who is Erik Davis" several of the newbies mentioned? That really shocked me.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Like Miss Moon (I've said it again!) I do enjoy some of the bells on AQ - the map that shows where some of the boxes are located within a town. Makes for effiecient planning when visiting new locales but with well over 2000 finds, Sue &amp; I have done fine without it though all those years prior to Ryan develoing this. But it is kinda cool.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Maybe we (the vets) need to do a better job with educating those new to the hobby. It's something we've tried to do on the Newboxers list. But - newbies need to have the desire to learn. Therein may lie the rub.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Thanks for reading my post. I'm enjoying this thread.</div>

</span></blockquote>I disagree (since no one educated me and I made up my own rules, I<br/>
guess I'm biased).  Newbies (and anyone else), are free to enjoy<br/>
the hobby as they please, within the bounds of certain ethics such<br/>
as LNT, courtesy, etc., which are a different scope than this<br/>
conservation.<br/>
<br/>
I even think Ryan (or anyone else) is entitled to make a buck, if such<br/>
a market exists.  I'm not aware of too many people who don't sell some<br/>
sort of good or service (and those who don't, IMHO, have little right<br/>
to judge those who must).  Everyone, be they buyer or purveyor of<br/>
schlock, has their own gods to answer to, not me.<br/>
<br/>
So, I don't really agree that some sort of veteran elite should attempt<br/>
to keep the hobby in some mold that it was when they joined (not that<br/>
I'm necessarily suggesting that that is happening, but I come across<br/>
that way sometimes, I suppose).  They, however, may want to stay in<br/>
that mold, and see how the market of ideas treats them, and make sure<br/>
they are comfortable answering to their own gods.<br/>
<br/>
I do agree with one thing however, from my oft-quoted Don Henley song --<br/>
<br/>
"They call it paradise, I don't know why"<br/>
"You call someplace paradise, kiss it goodbye".<br/>
<br/>
Remember, tho, in that song, the ultimate condemnation is on the buyers,<br/>
not the purveyors.<br/>
<br/>
Everyone whines about Wal*Mart (at least they did when they came to<br/>
Kennett Square), but at the of the day, people vote with their feet<br/>
and wallets, don't they?  I don't shop at Wal*Mart, but who am I to<br/>
judge?  Is AQ the Wal*Mart of letterboxing?  What would that make<br/>
LbNA?<br/>
<br/>
Yes, I to am enjoying this thread.  All in good fun of course :)<br/>

How about starting here: what is so evil about AQ? The website is busy<br/>
for my taste, but I don't understand the politics here. Is it because<br/>
it promotes gathers, trading cards, postals, buddies etc? If that's<br/>
not your thing, then just ignore it and leave others to it, right?<br/>

public site, and any site can link to it.<br/>
<br/>
As for 15 minutes of fame? I think it is better one leads a reporter in <br/>
the right direction rather then let them go and write it on their own. <br/>
If any new boxers come of what is written, at least they will get a good <br/>
start on what letterboxing is and how it is done.<br/>

</span></blockquote>I am probably not old timey enough to answer this. I *am* however old <br/>
timey enough to remember a certain LBNA list in the PNW, when the <br/>
current ring leader of AQ joined in the shouts of pain and horror <br/>
when someone tried to do this very thing. An AQ style website, pre-<br/>
AQ. You'da thought the poor guy had started killing kittens or <br/>
something, the outcry was so bad. It upset me, because it seemed <br/>
unfair, and I also knew that boxer, and enjoyed him, and didn't <br/>
appreciate him being treated like that. <br/>
<br/>
And then I dropped off the face of the earth and when I resurfaced, <br/>
here is AQ. Like the much-maligned earlier site in eerie ways, except <br/>
one: different guy running it. <br/>
<br/>
I use AQ. I have some boxes up there. But that is my personal "beef" <br/>
with AQ. Now I just watch the site and giggle internally, to tell the <br/>
truth.<br/>
<br/>
I am a nobody in this sport/hobby/past time, and rarely log finds or <br/>
participate in the boards.So I feel like that means my opinion <br/>
doesn't carry much "weight"- no 1000 found or planted, no legendary <br/>
clues or finds, no groups of 'boxing friends. But since someone <br/>
specifically *asked*, I thought I'd throw this out there. It just <br/>

The thing is, I've never been a secret-squirrel type of boxer. I've <br/>
rolled my eyes at them, frankly. Made some snarky comments that no <br/>
one read when the "my boxes are super secret and your aren't so I'm <br/>

under the wire, don't post, don't argue, don't log finds. You just box when <br/>
you can for the pure freaking love of it. Most of us here do not fall into <br/>
that catagory, certainly not me. As far as I'm concerned your opinion counts <br/>
just as much anyone else's.<br/>
<br/>
And that's what it is about AQ that bothers me the most I think. I don't <br/>
think this hobby is the place for rating diamonds, statistical graphs, crap <br/>
like that. And I never, never will. Just let people post their boxes (even <br/>
LTCs...WHATever.....sell you freaking calenders...........WHATever.......and <br/>
leave the other crap out of it. It's tweaking carried to an extreme which <br/>
just does not belong in a creative, even artistic hobby.<br/>

<br/>
I am a nobody in this sport/hobby/past time, and rarely log finds or<br/>
participate in the boards.So I feel like that means my opinion<br/>
doesn't carry much "weight"- no 1000 found or planted, no legendary<br/>
clues or finds, no groups of 'boxing friends. But since someone<br/>
specifically *asked*, I thought I'd throw this out there. It just<br/>
confuses me, this sudden turn<br/>
from "we'reoldtimersandwedon'twantanyonetofindourcluesorrateourboxesor<br/>

to "letsallowfinderstocommentandgivelittlegoldstarsontotallysubjective<br/>

searches, boxes that I have already found don't pop up. Also, it allows <br/>
me to easily give the planter an update on the box. Usually I log finds <br/>
when I get around to it, as Schizokeet and Sheba, who I often box with, <br/>
will tell you. They are both much more diligent in the logging then I.<br/>

                    <div id="ygrps-yiv-1419996077">I don't log finds online.  I have a personal logbook<br/>
to put the stamps in.  And I leave my personal stamp in<br/>
the box.  All the visitors to a box can be found by<br/>
visiting the box and looking in the logbook.  That<br/>
seems to work out.<br/>
<br/>
I don't recall ever looking for the same box more than<br/>
once.  Of course, if I did, it would be because I<br/>
didn't remember the first experience, making the second<br/>
time a novel experience anyway, which seems fine to me.<br/>
I note that before logging was possible online, they got<br/>
by for over a century without it.  To each their own.<br/>
<br/>
The game was played in the US for years before online<br/>
logging became available.  Just because a website<br/>
operator happened to implement it one day, do I need<br/>
to change my view of the game?  Unfortunately, some<br/>
have answered yes to this question, suggesting that<br/>
logging is obligatory, and not doing so is "anti-social".<br/>
<br/>
I don't log finds online (and don't list on web sites that<br/>
allow such) because I feel doing so is an information leak,<br/>
which is not part of my view of game as 'simulated treasure<br/>
hunting'.  So, that specific action is contrary to my view<br/>
of the game, that's all.<br/>
<br/>
Of course, I'm prolly not a "true boxer" :)<br/>

&gt; Your reasons are pretty much why I log on AQ, so that when I do <br/>

&gt; me to easily give the planter an update on the box. Usually I log finds <br/>

&gt; will tell you. They are both much more diligent in the logging then I.<br/>

&gt; &gt; You see, to me you are the kind of person who is a<br/>
&gt; *True Boxer*. You <br/>
&gt; &gt; stay under the wire, don't post, don't argue,<br/>
&gt; don't log finds. You <br/>
&gt; &gt; just box when you can for the pure freaking love of<br/>
&gt; it. <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Just wondering, if you don't log your finds/attempts<br/>
&gt; anyplace how do<br/>
&gt; you keep track of your boxes? I don't really care about<br/>
&gt; counts and<br/>
&gt; ribbons and stars, but just for an organizational sense. I<br/>
&gt; have the<br/>
&gt; memory of a gnat- I'd go to the same park and hunt the<br/>
&gt; same MIA box 15<br/>
&gt; times (or heck, if I didn't make a list from my log<br/>
&gt; stamps, hunt a box<br/>
&gt; I had already found). <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; (The other benefit of logging them via AQ is so people like<br/>
&gt; me who<br/>
&gt; care know it's an active box or not, and an easy way of<br/>
&gt; contacting the<br/>
&gt; placer on the status.) </span></blockquote></div>

We started using LBNA and recording our finds there.  I then was <br/>
introduced to AQ and logged our finds there for some time.  Then, <br/>
decided that in transferring find information I had errors and <br/>
inaccuracies and then was finding boxes others requested not be <br/>
posted as "found" online.  I then moved to an excel spreadsheet, <br/>
only to be viewed by me and respecting the requests of others.  The <br/>
spreadsheet has helped me to reduce inaccuracies, but I still find <br/>
them, albeit rarely.  In the end, I know the only truly accurate <br/>
listing of our finds is our logbook. <br/>
<br/>
It is quite possible that our future boxes will only be listed on <br/>
LBNA.  I'd love to host my own site of clues, but time and lack of <br/>
computer saavy may prevent that. It is most important to us to <br/>
respect the desires of the planters and help keep boxes active. We <br/>
particularly enjoy encouraging new carvers and some of our favorite <br/>
planters.<br/>
<br/>
True boxer or not, we have a great time.  Labels and the "majority" <br/>
won't limit what we do or how we do it. We rely on our own values to <br/>
guide us through that.<br/>

&gt; I don't log finds online.  I have a personal logbook<br/>

&gt; the box.  All the visitors to a box can be found by<br/>
&gt; visiting the box and looking in the logbook.  That<br/>
&gt; seems to work out.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I don't recall ever looking for the same box more than<br/>

&gt; didn't remember the first experience, making the second<br/>

&gt; I note that before logging was possible online, they got<br/>
&gt; by for over a century without it.  To each their own.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; The game was played in the US for years before online<br/>
&gt; logging became available.  Just because a website<br/>
&gt; operator happened to implement it one day, do I need<br/>
&gt; to change my view of the game?  Unfortunately, some<br/>
&gt; have answered yes to this question, suggesting that<br/>
&gt; logging is obligatory, and not doing so is "anti-social".<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I don't log finds online (and don't list on web sites that<br/>
&gt; allow such) because I feel doing so is an information leak,<br/>
&gt; which is not part of my view of game as 'simulated treasure<br/>

      log finds. You <br/>&gt; just box when you can for the pure freaking love 
      of it. <br/><br/>Just wondering, if you don't log your finds/attempts 
      anyplace how do<br/>you keep track of your boxes? I don't really care about 
      counts and<br/>ribbons and stars, but just for an organizational sense. I 
      have the<br/>memory of a gnat- I'd go to the same park and hunt the same 
      MIA box 15<br/>times (or heck, if I didn't make a list from my log stamps, 
      hunt a box<br/>I had already found). <br/><br/>(The other benefit of logging 
      them via AQ is so people like me who<br/>care know it's an active box or 
      not, and an easy way of contacting the<br/>placer on the 
      status.)<br/><br/></p></div></blockquote></div></div><span style="COLOR:white;"></span></div></div></div></blockquote></div><br/></div>

<br/>
</span></blockquote>It's sad to think you consider AQ comparable to WOL, but I guess if AQ<br/>
is the Wal-Mart of letterboxing, that would make WoL the K-mart of<br/>
letterboxing? =)<br/>
<br/>
WoL scared me--I didn't like the site, but the thing that scared me<br/>
was that I knew it was implementing features that people wanted and<br/>
LbNA wasn't going to do. I didn't much like the person running the<br/>
site, and I didn't much like the way it was implemented, but I saw the<br/>
writing on the wall. Things are going to change whether you like it or<br/>
not. At least this way, I was able to help direct some of the changes<br/>
into things that made more sense. <br/>
<br/>
Such as not counting postals, virtuals, and other non-letterboxes as<br/>
part of the PFX count. Such as setting up a rating system that doesn't<br/>
point out the *worst* rated boxes out there. Such as simple icons<br/>
rather than a complex encoding system that needed to decoder to<br/>
understand.<br/>
<br/>
It was a terrible website, and I hated the idea of it getting any<br/>
traction, so yes, I was very much against it, and I don't miss it. But<br/>
it should have been a wake-up call for everyone on LbNA, and I'm<br/>
rather disappointed to see that didn't happen. The folks at<br/>
geocaching.com bought the domain at letterboxer.com--did you know<br/>
that? Try typing letterboxer.com into your browser. I'd have been<br/>
appalled if they developed a "letterboxing" website, and I like to<br/>
think that perhaps, maybe, just because Atlas Quest exists with all<br/>
those bells and whistles a lot of people like, maybe that's the reason<br/>
they never did anything with the domain--something that could have<br/>
been far worse than you'll find on AQ.<br/>
<br/>
And, heck, I make up a lot of stuff along the way. Originally, I just<br/>
wanted to practice my programming skills and create a site so people<br/>
could log all their finds online. A lot of people were doing it anyhow<br/>
on their personal websites, and it seemed like it would be nice if<br/>
they were all in one place to make it easier to find. I would have<br/>
never guessed it would grow into what it has today nor that it would<br/>
ever make enough money to pay my bills.<br/>
<br/>
Rather a nice surprise for me, as it turned out--the best job I've<br/>
ever had. =) Anyone who thinks I do it just for the money is sadly<br/>
mistaken, though. Last year, I didn't even make half of what I did<br/>
working at Intel in 2001. The pay sucks.<br/>
<br/>
Anyhow, I've always been a little bothered by some of things people<br/>
say about me that I don't feel are accurate such as being a hypocrite<br/>
for criticizing WoL then setting up AQ. I understand the criticism<br/>
because on the surface, the two websites are very similar, but I also<br/>
feel it's unfair. I wanted LbNA to evolve more than it had, and if it<br/>
had, Atlas Quest would never have become as big as it has. It's not<br/>
the end of LbNA--I can't imagine letterboxing without LbNA--but it<br/>
serves a new roll as the letterboxing website of choice for those that<br/>
don't need or want bells and whistles.<br/>
<br/>
Back in the old days, when someone complained on the talk list about<br/>
how they didn't like something on LbNA or they thought something<br/>
should change, the response was often, "Then maybe you should find<br/>
some other hobby." I never liked to challenge such statements because<br/>
invariably it was always said by people I considered friends, but it<br/>
bothered me. To me, letterboxing should be open to anyone and everyone<br/>
who wants to participate. Regardless of age, gender, race, religion,<br/>
physical fitness--it doesn't matter. I feel it should be open to<br/>
everyone, and kicking someone out just because they think the hobby<br/>
can be improved is a bad precedent.<br/>
<br/>
I'm rather happy to see that such statements rarely happen anymore. =)<br/>
LbNA is not for everyone--it's not for people who embrace changes or<br/>
growth. Before those people had no where else to go, but now they do.<br/>
And they're planting sometimes really cool letterboxes, which often<br/>
are listed on letterboxing.org allowing you to enjoy their work as well.<br/>
<br/>
I also feel there's still room for several niche letterboxing<br/>
websites. Atlas Quest I try to design to accommodate as wide variety<br/>
of people as I can, but not everyone enjoys a website that tries to be<br/>
everything to everyone, and there's still room for niche websites that<br/>
fill those needs for people who'd like to letterbox but find that<br/>
neither Atlas Quest nor LbNA suit their needs.<br/>

<br/>
There is a tremendous amount of history I know, I'm afraid.<br/>
Fortunately, it doesn't mean all that much (at least to me).  Are<br/>
you aware of the putative takeover of letterboxing by geocaching.com?<br/>
(circa 2000 IIRC, but I'd have to look it up).  Alot of me wishes it<br/>
would have happened at the time, rather than the state things are now.<br/>
(More on that later).<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; I'd have been appalled if they developed a "letterboxing" website, <br/>

<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; and I like to think that perhaps, maybe, just because Atlas Quest <br/>

<br/>
</span></blockquote>It seems like speculation that it would have been "worse", but it<br/>
does seem at least a tacit suggestion that AQ went in a direction<br/>
where such a comparative is appropriate.  The defense that I'll do<br/>
such and such just that someone else doesn't has always rung hollow<br/>
with me.  I'll tear down the old growth forest and build a shopping<br/>
mall, so the guy down the street doesn't and build a strip mall.<br/>
Not to necessarily suggest that letterboxing was  "old growth"<br/>
before AQ (or that malls are somehow "worse" than old growth forests<br/>
per se, with strip malls being worse than shopping malls), only to<br/>
point out my issues with that line of defense in the abstract (tho<br/>
letterboxing certainly seems to be not old growth today :-)).<br/>
<br/>
As for the Wal-Mart analogy, that's my work IIRC, and I think it<br/>
holds pretty well.  I have nothing against Wal-Mart either, I just<br/>
don't shop there.  To each his own.  I'm not a big admirer of the<br/>
McWal-Marting of society, and I simply vote with my feet.  Obviously,<br/>
a very small minority agrees with me, and that's fine also.<br/>
<br/>
And what could Grounded, Inc., have done that is "worse" than<br/>
LTCs? :)  I'm interested in your vision of how Grounded, Inc.,<br/>
would be "worse".  (And that's not my word).<br/>
<br/>
Ryan, in all honesty, I'm happy for you that AQ is successful, and<br/>
you enjoy operating it.  I don't like it, but I don't think you<br/>
need to defend it.  It is what it is, and people vote with their<br/>
feet.  That said, I don't personally find your defense all that<br/>
compelling.<br/>
<br/>

</span></blockquote>"Hypocrite" isn't the right word, but you were an aggressive<br/>
detractor (remember the Fright Fest (tm), for example :-); I<br/>
certainly do, and I wasn't even meant to be in that crossfire).  I<br/>
just took it to be a turf war.  Happens in business all the time.<br/>
Nothing to apologize for, I guess.  What was so wrong with WoL<br/>
anyway?<br/>
<br/>
Like I said, good luck with it, and I mean that.  Just not for me,<br/>
just like my stamps "look like the work of a kindergartner" :)<br/>
(well, at least I acknowledge that they do, in fact ...)<br/>
<br/>
Back to my original comment, the best case would have been for<br/>
geocaching.com to have taken over letterboxing (as I see no<br/>
difference between the geocaching.com game, and the AQ game), and<br/>
that would have consolidated McLetterboxing in one place, while<br/>
leaving the boutique sites for those who enjoy that style of play.<br/>
LbNA would have been the odd man out.  As it stands now, I still<br/>
see LbNA as the odd man out, trapped somewhere between tradition<br/>
and McLetterboxing, not quite sure where to position itself, and<br/>
when to do so.  So, its a big hassle for everyone, tracking,<br/>
listing, etc., on two sites; and what economic benefit is derived<br/>
from that waste?<br/>

&gt; toys. Probably make an icon so people would know when<br/>
&gt; there's "art" in<br/>
&gt; the box instead of dumb little toys. =)<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Now, I will admit, my fears could be wrong and completely<br/>
&gt; unjustified,<br/>
&gt; but all the same, I'd just prefer that letterboxers run<br/>
&gt; letterboxing<br/>
&gt; websites.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; It seems like speculation that it would have been<br/>
&gt; "worse", but it<br/>
&gt; &gt; does seem at least a tacit suggestion that AQ went in<br/>
&gt; a direction<br/>
&gt; &gt; where such a comparative is appropriate.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; It is speculation. I'd offer hard facts if I could, but<br/>
&gt; fortunately,<br/>
&gt; the "worse" never happened--well, except for<br/>
&gt; those folks who consider<br/>
&gt; AQ being "worse." &gt;<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; I'll tear down the old growth forest and build a<br/>
&gt; shopping<br/>
&gt; &gt; mall, so the guy down the street doesn't and build<br/>
&gt; a strip mall.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Now that's not really a fair comparison either, since I<br/>
&gt; never had to<br/>
&gt; tear down an old growth forest to build Atlas Quest.<br/>
&gt; Letterboxing.org<br/>
&gt; is still has more users, still gets most the credit in<br/>
&gt; newspapers and<br/>
&gt; magazine articles. LbNA still exists, and probably will<br/>
&gt; continue to<br/>
&gt; thrive just fine for many decades to come.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; In the virtual world, you don't have to tear down<br/>
&gt; something old to<br/>
&gt; start something new.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; And what could Grounded, Inc., have done that is<br/>
&gt; "worse" than<br/>
&gt; &gt; LTCs? :)<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I didn't invent LTCs. I just gave them a place to play<br/>
&gt; where I don't<br/>
&gt; have see them. =)<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; "Hypocrite" isn't the right word, but<br/>
&gt; you were an aggressive<br/>
&gt; &gt; detractor (remember the Fright Fest (tm), for example<br/>
&gt; :-);<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; True. It was a very, very bad website. =) <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; So, its a big hassle for everyone, tracking,<br/>
&gt; &gt; listing, etc., on two sites; and what economic benefit<br/>
&gt; is derived<br/>
&gt; &gt; from that waste?<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Well, I'm not all that thrilled tracking stuff on two<br/>
&gt; different<br/>
&gt; websites. It's rather inconvenient, and I would have<br/>
&gt; loved to have<br/>
&gt; merged the clues on LbNA with those on AQ (even more so<br/>
&gt; early on when<br/>
&gt; there was practically nothing listed on AQ in the first<br/>
&gt; place), but<br/>
&gt; that idea didn't seem like it would anywhere.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; But hey, if you can make it happen on the LbNA end of<br/>
&gt; things, I'd be<br/>
&gt; absolutely thrilled to develop a system where LbNA can do<br/>
&gt; more talking<br/>
&gt; with Atlas Quest, so if the status of a box is changed on<br/>
&gt; one site,<br/>
&gt; the other site can automatically be notified of the change<br/>
&gt; and have<br/>
&gt; the change happen there. That sort of stuff would be<br/>
&gt; enormously useful<br/>
&gt; for everyone, or to make it easier for people to list boxes<br/>
&gt; on both<br/>
&gt; sites simultaneously. But I didn't see that idea<br/>
&gt; getting off the ground.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Things could definitely be more efficient, though.<br/>
