                    <div id="ygrps-yiv-1557486535">Hi All,<br/>
<br/>
After a long family vacation in the hinterlands of NE PA, I find <br/>
myself wondering "Where's ya box dis weekend?"  I was in the company <br/>
of what seemed like half the population of my old stompin' grounds <br/>
(Lawn Guyland) at a family resort in NE PA.  It was just like growin' <br/>
up again!  ;-)  "Jimmy stop dunkin' yur sistuh!"  "Hey, I'm wawkin' <br/>
here!"  ...<br/>
<br/>
We did manage to find one letterbox on the way up (Silent Doug's <br/>
Shuman Point off of Lake Wallenpaupack - dropped a birdie on a <br/>
bunny!), but nixed going after Irving Cliffs because Andy (our non-LB <br/>
son) threw up after a wild ride on route 590 back to Hawley on the <br/>
way home.  Maybe next time.<br/>
<br/>
So, I ask youze guys "Where's ya box dis weekend?"<br/>

replace a box we'd found with decayed stamp and book. So, if <br/>
anyone's after the "Back to the Future" boxes - 1, 2, and the new 4 <br/>
are there. We still couldn't find the third.<br/>
Drove up and down the wrong Woodbridge Ave. for a while, then got on <br/>
the right one and got Mary Moore, which brought me to F98. Seemed <br/>
like the whole church was there for a workday; hard to be subtle, <br/>
but we managed.<br/>
Drove through a park looking for Meuly Woods. Saw folks setting up <br/>
for a birthday party for a 1 yr. old, according to the very large <br/>
banner. There must have been at least 40 "goody bags" (HUGE - <br/>
baskets full of school supplies!) set up waiting for guests. That <br/>
must be SOME baby! But we moved on...<br/>
Wandered around the VanWickle house looking for the five plank <br/>
bridge. The nine-planked one didn't work at all. Gave up.<br/>
Heading for the East Brunswick parks, I ran over something. After <br/>
that, the car made horrible noises while turning, so I stopped <br/>
promptly at the nearest service station. Waited in the smoke and <br/>
tire smelling room watching Olympics and developing a headache. <br/>
Turned out it was some piece of trim under the car which got bent <br/>
back to where it rubbed on the tire. They used a little tie-down to <br/>
pull it back, didn't charge me, and I was out of there - with a <br/>
headache, so I just headed home.<br/>
Yesterday afternoon we (w/husband this time) nabbed Warcat's new <br/>
boxes in Franklin Lakes to reach F101!! Then, Wayne thought we <br/>
needed some more hiking, so we went to the Palisades Interstate <br/>
Park, Stateline Lookout Section, to hike down to Peanut Leap Falls. <br/>
I've never hiked past a "Warning: next 2 miles of trail very <br/>
difficult" sign before, have you? I HAD been thinking a box was in <br/>
order, since the name lends itself to a cute stamp image, but I <br/>
really don't think I want to be responsible for box maintainance!<br/>

the web is <a href="http://www.houseinprogress.net/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.houseinprogress.net/</a> a great blog by a couple <br/>
with an old bungalow in Chicago. (We have an old bungalow, too) When <br/>
things look down, compare your situation with theirs.<br/>

</span></blockquote>Well....we managed to actually get in a little boxing dispite the <br/>
intense fact that it was opening weekend of the MD Ren Faire, my wife <br/>
and I run two business there with 6 employes to manage and opening <br/>
was terriblly hot. I create sculptural leather masks and let me tell, <br/>
this was not a wknd where many folks wanted to strap leather to their <br/>
faces....no sir-re. However ,with 10,000 thanks to Scarab of the <br/>
Doubtful Guests, we managed to be 1st finders on his two new micro-<br/>
boxes at the faire. Now let me tell, as we are involved with the <br/>
faire, we can be on grounds during the week.The faire has good <br/>
security with photo IDs. The grounds are mostly empty during the <br/>
week, we know mostly everone who would be there then. It would be a <br/>
simple matter for us to hunt these boxes with absolutly no-one <br/>
around. But that wouldn'nt be the same now would it? So lovely Lady <br/>
Woodwose and I, left the booths in our "faeries" capable hands and <br/>
took baby woodwose for a long walk on Sunday to see if we could get <br/>
her asleep and to hunt the boxes. Success for both! Let me tell, <br/>
these were fun retrivals! We have the added advantage of knowing the <br/>
faire really well, and I didn't have to follow all the compass <br/>
directions for the "Brass Dragon"(Whew, The look fun however!) But <br/>
pulling a micro in such a packed setting, we even went during the <br/>
height of the day, was awesome! Of note, Take him seriously about the <br/>
poison ivy vine!!!! As we are in garb and folks will watch you to see <br/>
if you are a faire character and are going to do something, then this <br/>
was really hard. I made an exceptional boo-boo by dropping the stamp <br/>
over a railing and being forced to climb over and retrieve in! (I <br/>
can't believe I just admitted that, how embarassing!) I can't say how <br/>
much I appreciate getting to box at my little village of Revel Grove! <br/>
We did two other boxing things. We launched our "Face in the Woods" <br/>
box at the faire. Sort of a personal traveller for our booth. The <br/>
clue are rather easy, but I think the box is could be one of the more <br/>
unique ones folks might come across so I hope to see ya. I wanted to <br/>
create at box that worked within the setting of the faire. Here I am <br/>
again, planting a box where I get to meet other boxers!(See <br/>
the "Green Rose Labyrinth" box, located at our home studio)<br/>
And one last thing, <br/>
Hey Scarab, I took Johnny Fox to the box on Monday. he had read the <br/>
TIME article which had attracted his attention because he had heard <br/>
about the box last year! He tought it was cool and signed in! <br/>
We look forward to checking back on the boxes during the faire season <br/>
to see who comes, although I will expect all who do to hit the "Face" <br/>
as well, ya won't be disappointed if ya like art boxes! And if your <br/>
there and ya spy a young guy, (almost 32, I can still say that?) <br/>
wearing alot of green and maybe a cornacopia basket as a hat, goatee, <br/>
and longish hair, well ask and see if it might be me,<br/>
