<div>I have to chime in on this one!</div>
<div> </div>
<div>I agree with Miss Moon 100%. (now that's something I never thought I'd 
  say!)  :-)</div>
<div>Many of us have had the opportunity to "sing the praises" of our favorite 
  hobby.</div>
<div>But why? Publicity about letterboxing was equated to the following from 
  an enigma from the north:</div>
<div> </div>
<div>"It's like having your own private fishing hole - teaming with fat, plump 
  trout in an idyllic setting. Then you tell your friends about it; who tell 
  other friends, etc. By the next time you return, the fish are gone, the wild 
  flowers are trampled and there is litter all over."</div>
<div> </div>
<div>I see this as almost a generational thing (although age doesn't really 
  enter into this - it's more like the years you've been letterboxing. ) 
  Those of us who have been boxing for 3+ years feel differently about bells 
  &amp; whistles and publicity. Those new to this hobby know nothing different 
  than all that Atlas Quest has to offer.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>I was on Atlas Quest several months ago and happened to read a post where 
  Erik Davis was mentioned. "Who is Erik Davis" several of the newbies 
  mentioned? That really shocked me.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Like Miss Moon (I've said it again!) I do enjoy some of the bells on AQ - 
  the map that shows where some of the boxes are located within a town. Makes 
  for effiecient planning when visiting new locales but with well over 2000 
  finds, Sue &amp; I have done fine without it though all those years prior to 
  Ryan develoing this. But it is kinda cool.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Maybe we (the vets) need to do a better job with educating those new to 
  the hobby. It's something we've tried to do on the Newboxers list. But - 
  newbies need to have the desire to learn. Therein may lie the rub.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Thanks for reading my post. I'm enjoying this thread.</div>

<div><font face="Arial" size="2">And therein lies one of the problems, which is 
    what I hope you meant....the fact that the boxers either sought out the 
    publicity or went along with it. It's called ego...get my picture in the 
    paper...15 minutes of fame. Rather than just box for the love of it and shut 
    up about it. </font></div>
<div><font face="Arial" size="2"></font> </div>
<div><font face="Arial" size="2">And one of the links goes to a page on lbna 
    with a long list of boxes, many of which are yours and other people on 
    this list. It's the whole eastern pa page. It's the slew of them here in 
    philly link. Did all of *these* people give their permission? Did *you* give 
    permission. Not hardly!! </font></div>
