I want to try either some Colorbox catseye or Dewdrop pads.<br/>
Which brand, and what the heck is chalk ink, and is it any good for<br/>
boxing?<br/>
<br/>
I have the Marvy Markers now, but really they bug me on the trail.<br/>
Especially when having to color in some giant stamp.<br/>
<br/>
FYI, I found my 10th letterbox this weekend! For some reason I feel<br/>
less newbie-like (Thanks again Natty) Maybe 11 tomorrow?</div>

<p> </p>
<p>Everyone has a different preference when it comes to ink.  My only recommendation is to avoid the METALLIC pigments unless you are the author and are placing them with the stamp because it really needs to be silver, or gold, or copper, etc.  Metallic pigments are very difficult to clean off and wind up getting on other people's pens - where they take forever to work their way off.<br/><br/><blockquote><span title="qreply"> --- On <b>Mon, 7/28/08, lunastrixae <i>&lt;lunastrixae@...&gt;</i></b> wrote:<br/></span></blockquote></p>

box together I go with his ink most of the time.  Although they are hard to get the finner <br/>
detail on a complicated image like the markers are.   The chalk ink is just another type of <br/>
ink. It does stamp very nicely too.  I'm using one for my current personal stamp but need <br/>
to get a bigger and darker ink pad for that to make things go a little smother.   I've been <br/>
on trail with out my markers and regretted it the whole time.  <br/>
Good luck and happy boxing.<br/>

                    <div id="ygrps-yiv-1923914431">Both are pigment inks and take a little longer to dry. I like the way the catseye nest together, but when in a  backpack they do need a rubberband around them to keep them together. I like both types of these inks for various artistic projects but have not purchased the small versions for use on the trail. Don't forget to scour the paper for coupons, with 40% off you can buy more.<br/>
