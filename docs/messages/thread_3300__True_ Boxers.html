Can I just say that I find this name, this concept of "True Boxer" to be offensive.<br/>
<br/>
I don't want to be the PC Patrol here.  I just want to say that I think the diversity of the <br/>
experience of letterboxing is part of it's beauty.  Some cut rubber.  Some write clues.  <br/>
Some like hikes.  Some go for numbers.  Some go to make friends.  Some go to avoid <br/>
friends.  Some plant more.  Some reap more.<br/>
<br/>
The individuality expressed in the game is, to me, as important as the game itself.<br/>
<br/>
I may disagree with people, but I respect just about everybody who respects the game.<br/>
[except Cyclonic, of course.  I'm sure you all understand] <br/>
<br/>
So I find the idea of Uber-Boxer - as if there is some sort of standard to aspire to - to be <br/>
kind of insulting.<br/>
<br/>
I'm going on vaca now to hide and seek.  So I won't be heating up the board with my <br/>
"opinions" for a while.  Sorry if I got annoying.<br/>
<br/>
I go to make North Carolina's Outer Banks a Letterboxer's Paradise and the Connecticut of <br/>
the South!<br/>
