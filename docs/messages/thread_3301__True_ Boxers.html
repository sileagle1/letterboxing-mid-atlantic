<div><font face="Arial" size="2">I'm sorry if you found it offensive. I didn't mean 
that the rest of us aren't good boxers or real boxers, or whatever. And I *do* 
respect others who respect it. And note that I included myself in that group of 
the 'rest of us'. I just meant I have lot of admiration for someone who can do 
that, just box and not take part in all the other crap, good and bad and 
indifferent. It's just kind of pure and unsullied so to speak. Period. Nothing 
more. </font></div>

<p>Since I seem to have time on my hands in front of a computer...<br/><br/>Can 
  I just say that I find this name, this concept of "True Boxer" to be 
  offensive.<br/><br/>I don't want to be the PC Patrol here. I just want to say 
  that I think the diversity of the <br/>experience of letterboxing is part of 
  it's beauty. Some cut rubber. Some write clues. <br/>Some like hikes. Some go 
  for numbers. Some go to make friends. Some go to avoid <br/>friends. Some plant 
  more. Some reap more.<br/><br/>The individuality expressed in the game is, to 
  me, as important as the game itself.<br/><br/>I may disagree with people, but I 
  respect just about everybody who respects the game.<br/>[except Cyclonic, of 
  course. I'm sure you all understand] <br/><br/>So I find the idea of Uber-Boxer 
  - as if there is some sort of standard to aspire to - to be <br/>kind of 
  insulting.<br/><br/>I'm going on vaca now to hide and seek. So I won't be 
  heating up the board with my <br/>"opinions" for a while. Sorry if I got 
  annoying.<br/><br/>I go to make North Carolina's Outer Banks a 
  Letterboxer' s Paradise and the Connecticut of <br/>the South!<br/>[You 
  newbies can ask around why that is funny]<br/><br/>Natty
