is like a video game. At the highest expert level is the Mapsurfer<br/>
approach and philosophy. I think Randy espoused that extremely well in<br/>
his most recent post.<br/>
<br/>
At the most beginner level would be something like a drive-by tot lot<br/>
box with straightforward clues designed for very young children that<br/>
you find on AQ with lots of comments and recent find reports.<br/>
<br/>
And then there is everything in between.<br/>
<br/>
You experience boxing at whatever level you're capable of. These days<br/>
many start at the beginner level. The hope of those of us who are<br/>
devoted to the pastime is that people will be intrigued enough to gain<br/>
experience and skill and explore the more difficult levels that open<br/>
up to them.<br/>
<br/>
Some never do. They may lose interest after a time. Or--like my son<br/>
when he's playing a video game, they may prefer to kick butt on a<br/>
lower level for a long time rather than grow in the skill and<br/>
challenge of the higher levels. Or maybe something about their life<br/>
situation precludes them from going further. So be it--they still can<br/>
enjoy things where they are.<br/>
<br/>
And those of us who like the rarefied air of more difficult and<br/>
challenging levels of boxing enjoy where we are too.<br/>
<br/>
Having said this, I do acknowledge the nagging fear (already<br/>
expressed) that the growing number of people indiscriminately boxing<br/>
on the lower levels will overexpose and endanger the pastime. How best<br/>
to slow the slide towards and yet prepare for that possibility is, I<br/>
think, one of the biggest challenges the boxing community faces.<br/>
