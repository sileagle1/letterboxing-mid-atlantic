I would never scoff at someone for wearing orange at any time of the <br/>

<br/>Walmart here has orange safety vests for dogs marketed by the ASPCA and on sale for a dollar each.  I picked up two this weekend in preparation for hunting season, because I'm always worried that the dogs will be mistaken for deer.  I guess I should pick up a vest for me, too.  And I'll continue to try to box and hike in areas that don't allow hunting or on days when hunting isn't allowed.<br/>

I don't hunt, but I do shoot at paper and clays sometimes. Even I know<br/>
"Don't shoot it unless you can see it" is Hunting Rule #2.<br/>
<br/>
This is a very close second to #1: "Never point your gun, loaded OR<br/>
unloaded at anything you don't want to die." <br/>
<br/>
Of course I always suspect #3 was violated in these cases. <br/>
#3: "Don't drink a bottle of Jack for breakfast before going hunting"<br/>

then they are walking around the park. I try not to worry about such <br/>

Is something like this tragic? You bet. Does it happen very often? Not <br/>

the rules, because the rules are there to protect everyone. Those that <br/>
don't face very, very stiff penalties, so there are very few that don't. <br/>

<div>Very true.  That's why I wear a safety belt.  I also try to minimize risks in other contexts as well.  </div>
<div> </div>
<div>--The vast majority of hunters are respectful and mindful <br/>of what they are doing. They take their sport very seriously and follow <br/>the rules, because the rules are there to protect everyone. Those that <br/>don't face very, very stiff penalties, so there are very few that don't. </div>
<div> </div>
<div>Of course.  Still, that's cold comfort to the victims of the bad apples - again, a good reason for precautionary measures.  Almost by definition, we're not dealing with the sharpest tools in the shed -- or the blind.  If you really want to freak yourself out, consider the case of Higgins v. Walls, involving a motorist in Delaware shot by a trespassing hunter (and convicted felon) while driving down Route 113.  There's no accounting for stupid.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>There are some who say that people tend to fear unlikely events more than ordinary ones:  </div>

<div> </div>
<div>Interestingly, many who might take extra precautions to avoid a hunting accident would probably underestimate the risk of tomatoing out:</div>

<div> </div>
<div>I still think it's a good idea to wear brightly colored clothing anywhere a really stupid person might mistake you with game.</div>
