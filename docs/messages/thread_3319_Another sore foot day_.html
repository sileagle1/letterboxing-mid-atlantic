&gt; It was yet again another good day for boxing and we have the sore feet <br/>
&gt; to prove it.  Although it started out raining on the early morning <br/>
&gt; drive and was pouring only minutes before we arrived at our spot of the <br/>
&gt; day - it cleared up quickly and the sun was out for the rest of the <br/>
&gt; day. So, off I went boxing with The Pakrat and we tackled the Sourland <br/>
&gt; Preserve boxes in NJ.  We put in a good 7 miles of hiking through the <br/>
&gt; woods and mountain with some pretty good elevation changes along the <br/>
&gt; way.  Lots of rocks on these trails.  A good day and some nice boxes <br/>
&gt; found.  -John<br/>
