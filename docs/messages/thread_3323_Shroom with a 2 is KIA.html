Disk golf is a game that is played like regular golf but uses frisbees, <br/>
or disks, since they are specially made for it, to play.  There is a tee <br/>
and a basket that you are aiming for at the other end of the hole.  It <br/>
is usually played in the woods, and there are hundreds of courses set up <br/>
nationwide.  It is a lot of fun, you should give it a try sometime.<br/>

<br/>
Each of the disks have different flight characteristics, they hook a <br/>
different way and are meant to go different distances. Personally, I <br/>
only own three disks, but Schizokeet has a bunch. I am not that good, I <br/>
would be better if the disk weighed about three pounds I always say, but <br/>
then I probably would hurt people.<br/>
<br/>
Schizokeet perked up when MLR issued the challenge for Hickory Run. Too <br/>
bad we couldn't go, that North Jersey chick would be goin' down ;-) Next <br/>
time!<br/>

&gt;  OK - I think that challenge from Hickory Run Park was for my family <br/>
&gt; members only :-). But will take Schizokeet on next time we meet!! A <br/>
&gt; friendly wager, maybe? <br/>
&gt; Loser carves &amp; plants a box in honor of the winner? What do you think <br/>
&gt; Schizokeet? You up for it? ;-)<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Maple Leaf Red<br/>
&gt; (already wondering where I am going to plant the box that'll I have <br/>
&gt; to carve :-) )<br/>

&gt; &gt; Schizokeet perked up when MLR issued the challenge for Hickory Run. <br/>
&gt; Too <br/>
&gt; &gt; bad we couldn't go, that North Jersey chick would be goin' down ;-) <br/>
&gt; Next <br/>
