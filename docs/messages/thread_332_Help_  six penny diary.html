   Spent Saturday out searching for the Six Penny Diary box at French <br/>
Creek State Park, no luck!! Does anyone know if this box is lost or <br/>
has anyone found it recently?  I spent a while searching, and would <br/>
hate to find out that it is indeed missing.  Oh well, hope everyone <br/>
had a better weekend boxing!  Lotus</div>

Considering that it's a Mapsurfer box, it's entirely possible that <br/>
you just didn't have the correct spot...<br/>
