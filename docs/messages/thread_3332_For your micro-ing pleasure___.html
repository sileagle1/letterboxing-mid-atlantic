<div><font face="Arial" size="2">Carving hint # 347: (if u don't already know 
it--&lt;s&gt;) If you want to do a bigger stamp than will fit in the tube, carve 
one that will fit if it's cut in half. Put several layers of clear packing tape 
on the back. Some people like duct tape. I prefer the clear tape. Cut the stamp 
in half until you get to the tape. You still get a great image with no line down 
the middle. Holds up forever, so far. I've never had one come off the clear 
tape. Somebody passed that little hint on to me when I first started boxing.

actual photo. They come with screw-on caps. <br/>
<br/>
Reading the box of the ones I have from the lab (mine are<br/>
Fischerbrand) it says "plug seal screw caps". The ones they are<br/>
selling in this catalog look just like them.<br/>
<br/>
Great tip about cutting the stamp in half! Thanks.<br/>
