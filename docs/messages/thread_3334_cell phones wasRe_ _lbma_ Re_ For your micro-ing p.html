<br/>
It shouldn't be a problem.<br/>
<br/>
1) The strips on credit cards are made to resist erasure to guard<br/>
against casual reprogramming. A really super magnet would be required.<br/>
<br/>
2) The level of current in a cell phone wouldn't create a magnetic<br/>
field large enough. I have doubts it would even get through the case<br/>
of a cell phone.<br/>
<br/>
3) Antenna transmissions are lower EMF then other parts of the phone,<br/>
and the radio/micro wave transmissions will not erase the strip.<br/>
<br/>
Perhaps, maybe a snap on a cell phone case/caddy/purse. However I have<br/>
doubts on even this. Maybe on your library or grocery store card.<br/>

It could have been something else completely, like wear on the card<br/>
