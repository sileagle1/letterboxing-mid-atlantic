Cedar Creek box. I would appreciate if anyone near that area might keep <br/>
an eye out for my bag and let me know. It was an Eagle Creek brand tri-<br/>
fold toiletries bag. Had stamps, logbook, train whistle, compasses, <br/>
carving tool, etc etc in it. Practically my entire LBX arsenal. :-( <br/>
This is not a clue. The bag flew off my car somewhere between the Cedar <br/>
Creek Box and Lost River State Park in Hardy County WV. <br/>

</span></blockquote>I wish I could help you out, had you posted this a few weeks ago after <br/>
you left the bag, I was in the area and could have looked.<br/>
<br/>
You may want to contact Family Man, he lives in the area and may be able <br/>
to help you out.<br/>
