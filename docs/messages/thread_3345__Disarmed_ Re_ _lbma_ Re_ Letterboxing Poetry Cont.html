</span></blockquote>I guess it's official.  I'm old.<br/>
Up until now I was a "problem child."<br/>
Now I have survived long enough to be called "iconoclastic."<br/>
<br/>
I want to thank all my dear, dear friends in the LBMA community for not only perpetuating <br/>
my infamy, but being so gleeful in doing so.  You will be remembered.  Oh yes.  You will <br/>
be remembered.<br/>
<br/>
A BRIEF HISTORY OF THE BUMPPO<br/>
<br/>
For the record, my infamy comes from two (yes, only 2) rather public screwups.<br/>
One was a completely disasterous compass conundrum at the Rubbermaid Road Rally 2 <br/>
where I - admittedly - failed completely.  AND YET everyone found the box anyway.  <br/>
<br/>
The other incident related to a magnetic microbox  I planted at the Live8 concert.  I failed <br/>
to notice I had planted the box under a GIANT ELECTRIC TRANSFORMER which - in case <br/>
you don't know is HIGHLY MAGNETIC.  Thus, throwing off all my bearings.  Sue me.<br/>
<br/>
There was an additional incident where I noticed that one compass I had was affected by <br/>
my body.  It would skew my bearings.  I later discovered it was because of the additional <br/>
cell density I have from being born on the planet Krypton.<br/>
<br/>
So you can see how this group - who frankly has a low threshold for entertainment - <br/>
would get a huge chuckle out of my misfortune and name a syndrome after me.<br/>
<br/>
In my defense, there is also quite a bit of whining going on from some who THINK they <br/>
have figured out a few clues that are -charitably - beyond their paygrade.<br/>
<br/>
And now you know... The REST Of The Story.<br/>

That's three! And furthermore, half of the teams there didn't find<br/>
that box.  We got all of our bonus boxes the old fashioned way, by<br/>
cheating.<br/>
