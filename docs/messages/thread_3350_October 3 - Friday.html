<br/>
Amanda (from Seattle) and I will be in your neck of the woods for the Nancy Drew conference <br/>
this year - this time we are having it in PA Amish country (note Nancy Drew #33 is set in this <br/>
part of the country).  There is a big field trip to Philadelphia planned for Friday 10/3, but <br/>
since both of us have already been on that tour, we've decided to set that day aside for <br/>
letterboxing.  <br/>
<br/>
We are staying in Bird in Hand, which is a few miles east of Lancaster.  We are thinking that <br/>
maybe a meet and greet in the evening,  at the hotel might work out best - anyone have any <br/>
better suggestions?  Also, we will be boxing during the day, if anyone cares to join us.<br/>
<br/>
Hope this works out - I look forward to seeing you all again - I have fond memories of my <br/>
trip to PA last year.<br/>

During the day if you want to box, Lancaster County Rocks!<br/>
<br/>
I can suggest:<br/>
Nolde Forest<br/>
French Creek<br/>
Middle Creek<br/>
Sadsbury Preserve<br/>
<br/>
Pick one and I can meet you to guide you on a journey!<br/>
<br/>
We aren't good night people so the evening thing would not work for <br/>
us to well. Regardless of what you do, would like to meet you both!<br/>
