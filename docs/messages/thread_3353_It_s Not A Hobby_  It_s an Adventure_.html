From Sixinthesticks:<br/>
<br/>
-I posted this story on a yahoo letterboxing group.  I thought you might like to read how <br/>
we did finding le petit bison- Thank you for the adventure, Sixinthesticks--<br/>
<br/>
OK, I thought you might enjoy a newbie story. Laugh away-<br/>
<br/>
We six thought it would be fun to show some neighbors how to<br/>
letterbox. My oldest 2 planned the boxes and clues and went out and<br/>
hid them in our neighborhood. We invited 4 kids who were 9, 8, 6,<br/>
and 3 years old. (I figured it would give their mom a peaceful<br/>
afternoon and I'm used to some chaos.) After we had lunch and found<br/>
our boxes, the boys decided we should find a "real" letterbox. There<br/>
are a couple easy ones near our house that we had already found but I<br/>
was afraid my 10 year old would just walk right to the box and not<br/>
let them have the fun of finding it. I grabbed a clue that I<br/>
remembered as sounding child friendly and we headed out the door- me<br/>
and six kiddos- ages 10, 9, 8, 6, 3 and 2, all boys except the 3<br/>
y/o. Read that again, one "responsible adult" and 6 kids under that<br/>
age of 11. We found the right starting place and parked the van. The<br/>
brothers assured me that they had gone up this path before with their<br/>
parents and sister so I figured we would be fine.<br/>
<br/>
After an hour of hiking/carrying the 2 or 3 year old, up and down<br/>
ridges and gulleys (was that a "most difficult" hiking trail sign we<br/>
passed?) I told them we should turn around. (I'm not only slow, but<br/>
very bright) All I heard was, "We can't go back! We didn't find<br/>
it!" Another hour (yes, HOUR) brought us to where we thought the box<br/>
should be.<br/>
It was no where to be found. I wrestled the clue back from one of<br/>
the boys and realized we hadn't gone FAR enough. After another 20<br/>
minutes of alternately carrying the little ones, the boys found the<br/>
box. The little ones sat down, totally spent and not willing to take<br/>
another step. The boys scouted ahead and said that it looked like<br/>
the trail would head down to the road, instead of hiking all the way<br/>
back. As I stamped in, the sky grew completely black. Oh, no. I<br/>
quickly finished and made sure the box was back when the lightning<br/>
and thunder started. I have never heard a little girl shriek like<br/>
that in my life. "I WANT MY MOMMY!!!!!!! " "AAAAAHHHHHH! !!" I want<br/>
your mommy too, Sweetie, or mine! The shrieking continued and down<br/>
the hill we went.<br/>
<br/>
Suddenly the pack of boys in front of me stopped. "What's the<br/>
matter?" "We heard a crash- right over there- like something moving."<br/>
<br/>
Above the shrieking I yelled, "If you think that is a bear or a deer<br/>
trying to get us, you're crazy. They are running for their dear<br/>
lives because they are scared to death! KEEP HIKING!" We reached<br/>
the bottom of the hill and could see the road a scant 30 feet away.<br/>
Wonderful, right? Nope, swamp. Couldn't get around it with that<br/>
crew. Back on the trail, cross the bridge and I think I can see a<br/>
path to the road. I hike the 2 yo old up on to my shoulders and<br/>
bushwack through berry bryers up to my neck. The road! I went back<br/>
and carried each one over the bryers and we were on flat solid<br/>
ground. In the pouring rain. With lightning and thunder. And 2<br/>
toddlers in my arms.<br/>
<br/>
We walked about half a mile back before a couple of cars pulled<br/>
over. The first one I walked up to had a white haired lady with an<br/>
immaculately clean car. We looked like we had rolled down the hill<br/>
but this looked like a safe bet for hitchhiking to me. She didn't<br/>
mind and I piled the kids on top of each other in the back seat.<br/>
<br/>
-Yes, their mother is still talking to me.<br/>
-No, I don't recommend this to be done by non-professionals.<br/>
-Please make sure to double check the clue and take the RIGHT one.<br/>
-Check the weather before leaving.<br/>
-The doctor will give you a nice shot in the arm if your eye swells<br/>
shut from poison ivy.<br/>
-Six year olds always touch the poison ivy, and your neck, and your<br/>
face.</div>
