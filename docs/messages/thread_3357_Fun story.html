out of their pants. They tore off up the boardwalk and I followed, but<br/>
my wife was stopped by two ladies in a Mini. They wanted to know,<br/>
could she direct them to the trail near Foxcatcher?<br/>
<br/>
Well, she put two and two together and asked if they had found the box<br/>
in Goshen yet. We had to check the logbook after they left - they had<br/>
the cutest "Mini" stamp and their ink was the same color as their car.<br/>
Hope they found the other box too!</div>
