They've only been out there several months, though... <br/>

                    <div id="ygrps-yiv-2105934205">The ADG has released about 12 hitchhikers and 3 of them were sent <br/>
back to us.  Those 3 had traveled quite a bit, most of them made <br/>
their way up to New England for a while.  It took about 2 years each <br/>
to get the hitchers back.  We tape an envelope into the back of our <br/>
hitchers.  The envelope contains an address to a PO box and stamps. <br/>
This encourages people to return your hitchers to you.  And we <br/>
always seem to get the stamps back unused.  People may bitch and <br/>
moan all day on the main list but at heart most boxers are kind and <br/>
unselfish.  (now watch them go prove me wrong with more rants)<br/>
<br/>
Of the other 9 hitchers, about half of them are still moving about <br/>
and have been spotted in the last 6 months.  Based on our <br/>
experiences then I'd say the hitcher retention rate is about 50%.  <br/>
However we may have gotten lucky.  My recommendations would be keep <br/>
the log small and write instructions about the return into the <br/>
logbook.  We have also found that the home-made logbooks are really <br/>
appreciated and boxers tend to treat them with a little more respect <br/>
than a spiral bound book of 3X5 cards.<br/>
