high-tech treasure hunt in which participants use Global Positioning
Systems to locate small caches, commonly clear plastic containers,

have been approved for Miller Park and Boot Road Park, and enthusiasts
will now meet with parks and recreation officials to determine the

not have an adverse effect on environmentally sensitive places, like

to be minimally invasive for the environment. <br/><br/>According to
accepted guidelines in the geocaching community, caches must be moved

must be placed in accord with township approval and regulations.<br/><br/>West Whiteland will join several other townships, including Pennsbury, Warwick and New Garden, that participate in geocaching.<br/><br/> To contact staff writer Joe Langdon, send an e-mail to jlangdon@... . <p><br clear="all"/>
