                    <div id="ygrps-yiv-3038986">Due to those who expressed regrets about the date of 4/5/08, we are <br/>
redoing the event at Burholme Park Area for those newer folks &amp; those <br/>
who couldn't make 4/5 (&amp; any one else who wants to come). <br/>
Kind of a ltrboxing sampler w/ park, neighborhood, library, &amp; museum <br/>
as backdrop. <br/>
We hope to involve letterboxes, art, outdoor fun, fall colors, good <br/>
scenery &amp; company into a fun day. <br/>
About 12 boxes in mostly the  same hides w/ a few new hand carved <br/>
stamps. Any input &amp; suggestions are greatly appreciated. Boxes will <br/>
in place Sat. AM. to Mon. PM.<br/>
Loan of a few Burholme, pet, or Asian themed stamps or boxes would be <br/>
a help. We willhave about 12 hides (In small to quite small places). <br/>
Contact us if you want to help or place.<br/>
<br/>
The Mansion, Museum &amp; Library will be opened &amp; free 10 to 4PM,  <br/>
guided tours (also free) available . <br/>
The 68 acre free park offers picnic groves, garden, accessible rest <br/>
rooms (10-4PM), playground, hilltop views up to 30 miles, parking, <br/>
ball fields, woodland trail, streams, self guided walking history <br/>
tour, etc. Fees for mini-golf, driving range, snack bar, &amp; batting <br/>
cages. <br/>
We plan to have a host table, on the mansion side  lawn, near the 3 <br/>
large porches. We can have a small meeting space in the mansion <br/>
available 12 to 3:30 PM if there is a need.<br/>
The Museum &amp; Library do accept donations, should you desire.<br/>
<br/>
A lawn chair would be a good idea, as would a sun shade or rain fly <br/>
if you want. WE WILL GO RAIN OR SHINE.<br/>
Due to park rules this will be RSVP only &amp; limited to first 70 signed <br/>
up.<br/>
SEPTA Bus stops at park, regional rail line stops 150 yards from park.<br/>
FYI: CLUES will be updated by Oct. 30. <br/>
Check  Back Then.  However they are likely to be close to what is in <br/>
AQ database.</div>
