Some of you may know me as a letterboxer and some of you may know me<br/>
as the mother of a blind letterboxer (Outofsight) and the grandmother<br/>
of a letterboxer in training (Milkmonster). Recently, I have been<br/>
forced to put my letterboxing way, way back on my list of priorities<br/>
as the needs of my family have increased. My daughter and grandson are<br/>
the main priorities on my life and I have been focusing on spending as<br/>
much time with them as possible and I will do anything to make their<br/>
lives easier.<br/>
<br/>
That being said, my daughter lost her sight 8 years ago from diabetes.<br/>
She was an EMT before that time and her husband is a paramedic and a<br/>
fireman. My son in law works two full time jobs to make ends meet for<br/>
their little family since Laura no longer works outside the home. She<br/>
did go back to school to learn how to be a massage therapist and does<br/>
have a few clients that she treats regularly. She had learned to use a<br/>
computer before she lost her sight and was retrained on it after she<br/>
became blind. The computer is her main means of finding out anything<br/>
she needs to know since she can't read a newspaper or book or a box or<br/>
can as most of us would. But now her computer died.<br/>
<br/>
I found a contest to win a new computer but I am looking for votes to<br/>
help her win. You can read a lot about my daughter and grandson on my<br/>
blog at <a href="http://milkmonstersmimser.blogspot.com/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://milkmonstersmimser.blogspot.com/</a> but what I am asking,<br/>
really, I am begging, is for votes for her to win the computer at<br/>

If you could go to that website and click on the words "liked it" and<br/>
add a comment if you choose, I would appreciate it greatly. A new<br/>
computer would be the world to my daughter.<br/>
Thanks so much for any help,<br/>

But LBMA only has 516 members.  I hope you take this to LBusa (big<br/>
