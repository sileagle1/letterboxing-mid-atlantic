Just touching base with recent finds and others:<br/>
<br/>
"You Got To Have 'Em":  Replaced bag in need of help, but box was <br/>
mostly in good shape.  <br/>
<br/>
"Seven Bends":  This one is in good shape, dry and well-hidden.  <br/>
There are a lot of trees down.  This is located next to a great tower <br/>
in the mountains.  It was a clear day, and you could see lots of <br/>
ridges in VA and WV.  It would be good to see in the fall during <br/>
the "colors" and maybe even better after the leaves have dropped.  <br/>
<br/>
"Woodstock Tower Seedling":  This is near the Seven Bends letterbox, <br/>
but I couldn't find it.  Lots of trees down, so maybe it's there.  <br/>
Anyone found it lately?<br/>
<br/>
"2004 Campaign Trail Hitchhiker Race--Bush Hitchhiker":  found <br/>
at "Be's Search For The Mushroom Kindgom".  Nice stamp, and moving <br/>
soon to the Shenandoah Valley along I-81.<br/>
<br/>
"Oh Deer!":  What a great park this is in!  This park is worth some <br/>
time and the $4 to get in.  I looked for this tonight and found it <br/>
just before the rain started.  The bad news is that the logbook is <br/>
completely ruined due to water.  Most of the images are lost, and <br/>
remaining ones exist barely.  The letterbox container is no longer <br/>
watertight.  It was out in the open, although in this corner of the <br/>
park, you'd have been looking for the letterbox anyway.  It's been <br/>
rebagged and stamp is wrapped in a papertowel now.  <br/>
<br/>
"Helping Hands Charity Box":  This is in the same park as "Oh Deer!"--<br/>
but seems to be missing.  It's obvious where it should have been, and <br/>
in the rain I waded 50' through grass (and thorns) 4-5' high.  There <br/>
is no sign of it anywhere.  Anyone seen it lately?<br/>
<br/>
It was a good night though!<br/>
<br/>
Thanks,<br/>
