It's the national Speleological Society's Old Timers Reunion in teeny tiny Daily, WV. It's about 30 minutes outside of Elkins. Anyway, every labor day 2000-3000 cavers camp on an old farm there owned by the NSS, we more than double the population of the town. It's a blast. There are "Speleolympics" which are all kinds of events from rope climbing time trails, obstacle course, complete with lot's of mud, drinking contests, etc. Bands, beer and dancing every night under the Pavilion, hot tubs and saunas out in the woods along the river to be enjoyed au natural (caving makes one immodest as you are often changing by the side of your car). I am seriously thinking of entering the Orienteering Contest on Sunday. I have been interested in it for a couple of years now and letterboxing has really helped me with a lot of those skills. A couple of guys in my
 grotto have been trying to talk me into it so I may give it a go. I know I won't win, but to finish and find all of the checkpoints would be very satisfying. Of course, at the same time is the "Wine in the River Party" which is my usual Sunday afternoon activity. A couple hundred of us grab our lawn chairs, folding tables, coolers, battery operated blenders and sit in the middle of the Tygart River, which is small and shallow and drink all afternoon. I am usually a winner in that event!LOL! So, wine or walking...hmm. We'll see. </div>
<div> </div>
<div>Anyway, we do leave camp to go caving, hiking, etc. Carvin Carmen carved three great stamps, one the NSS logo,which I will probably plant up on Dolly Sods, one the logo for my grotto - Commander Cody Caving Club, the best caving club in the state of DE!! Well, okay so they're the only caving club in the state of DE, but they're still great. I think that's going to go up on Spruce Knob, the highest point in WV. And "The Windmills of Backbone Mountain" which I am hoping to drive out to and actually plant somewhere near the wind farm up on the mountain. It's a fantastic place. Plus I think there are a couple of boxes within an hour or so for me to hunt.</div>

<div>Have a great Labor Day weekend folks. Hopefully we won't get rained out by Hurricane Francis!</div>
