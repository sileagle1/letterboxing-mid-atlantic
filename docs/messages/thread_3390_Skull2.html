</span></blockquote>I would like to second that.  The gathering was great fun, and while I <br/>
would have liked a few more pubs on it, that was my only complaint.  <br/>
Otherwise, the stamps and placements were wonderful, the clues were <br/>
outstanding, and the lead in with the Gazette was fantastic.<br/>
<br/>
Becky and I both had a great time and stayed well into the night (I <br/>
think we finally rolled in at about 1:30am).  I will be sure to do a <br/>
full wrap-up on my blog later int he week, including some pictures.<br/>
