&gt; I think the best person to answer why Cyclonic does anything<br/>
&gt; would be Cyclonic. <br/>
&gt; Part of our AIM conversation this evening follows.  <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; [00:58] Cyclonic07: I very raely post to that list, most<br/>
&gt; times I hold my tongue because of what the list is supposed<br/>
&gt; to be, friendly<br/>
&gt; [00:59] Cyclonic07: and even if i am being friendly, others<br/>
&gt; don't see it that way<br/>
&gt; [00:59] Cyclonic07: so I often don't post<br/>
&gt; [00:59] Cyclonic07: but sometimes I think bad advise is<br/>
&gt; being given<br/>
&gt; [01:00] Cyclonic07: and it seems people like Mark and Don<br/>
&gt; don't like it when someone disagrees with the advice<br/>
&gt; they are giving<br/>
&gt; [01:01] Cyclonic07: Mark doesn't want a free and open<br/>
&gt; exchange of ideas, he wants folks to letterbox his way<br/>
&gt; [01:01] Cyclonic07: and I think that is what they don't<br/>
&gt; like about me<br/>
&gt; [01:01] Cyclonic07: I only joined the list because he was<br/>
&gt; talking about my site behind my back<br/>
&gt; [01:02] Cyclonic07: and not giving the whole story<br/>
&gt; [01:02] Cyclonic07: and I have called him on doing that<br/>
&gt; several times on other things as well<br/>
&gt; [01:02] Cyclonic07: he likes to spin things that happen<br/>
&gt; elsewhere and he has a ready audiance of 3000 that know no<br/>
&gt; better<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; (You asked, Mark.)<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; In my opinion, if Cyclonic believed (as he says) that<br/>
&gt; Don's asking for information about mystery boxes on the<br/>
&gt; list was improper, then Cyclonic did the absolutely correct<br/>

&gt; &gt; I just put the [...] on moderation and sent him an email to<br/>
&gt; &gt; that effect.<br/>
&gt; &gt; Why are some people so disagreeable.<br/>
&gt; &gt; Anyway - we'll comb over his posts with a fine tooth<br/>
&gt; &gt; comb.<br/>
&gt; &gt; I'm hoping he'll get pissed enough to just go away.<br/>
&gt; &gt;  <br/>
&gt; &gt; Best to you on Gwen. I still have to get your Geo in the<br/>
&gt; &gt; mail!!<br/>

&gt; &gt; Actually Nathan the question was meant to try to get<br/>
&gt; &gt; newboxers thinking <br/>
&gt; &gt; outside of the box, but to tell you the truth my guess is<br/>
&gt; &gt; that no one <br/>
&gt; &gt; knows exactly how many mystery boxes are hidden amongst the<br/>
&gt; &gt; various <br/>
&gt; &gt; areas in this chatlist's nooks and crannies.<br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; While I have my own guess, it may be woefully short.<br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; Part of this chatlist's concept is to help educate<br/>
&gt; &gt; newboxers rather <br/>
&gt; &gt; than to lurk about and toss out comments once in a while<br/>
&gt; &gt; that serve <br/>
&gt; &gt; little purpose. The main list has sufficient numbers of<br/>
&gt; &gt; those types of <br/>
&gt; &gt; comments. Thus you now have my explanation for the original<br/>
&gt; &gt; 'question'. <br/>
&gt; &gt; I thought that the explanation would have been unnecessary<br/>
&gt; &gt; for most <br/>
&gt; &gt; letterboxers, but since you posed your own question about<br/>
&gt; &gt; it I figured <br/>
&gt; &gt; there may be others that needed a clearer explanation as<br/>
&gt; &gt; well. Thank <br/>
&gt; &gt; you for the opportunity for clearity.<br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>

&gt; &gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; Is that not something you should figure out for<br/>
&gt; &gt; yourself?<br/>

&gt; &gt; &gt; Letterboxing is not a game for children; <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; it is a game for adults that children can learn how to<br/>
&gt; &gt; play.<br/>
