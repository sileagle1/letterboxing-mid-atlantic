I'm listed as a member because I joined so I could post about my now defunct

should I carve, etc, should maybe go bowling instead, or take up some other less

<div>I left the newboxers list a year ago, I think.  Someone asked 
        if it was okay to use store-bought stamps in a plant.  I replied 
        [not really kidding, I guess], Sure, it's your box; you can do it 
        however you want to.  But in your clues make sure you point out 
        it's a store-bought stamp, so I won't bother looking for it.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Oy vey, the reaction was swift and sure!  I had apparently 
        insulted mothers with small children, the handicapped, and anyone else 
        who did not have the talent [?] or time to invest in carving.  
        </div>
<div> </div>
<div>I decided maybe I wasn't a "newboxer" anymore or apparently kind 
        enough to help them out, lol, so I left that list.</div>
