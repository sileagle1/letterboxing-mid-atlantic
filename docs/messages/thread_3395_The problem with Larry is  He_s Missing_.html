If you want to ask for help with regards to carving donations - just<br/>
ask.  A gift should be given without expectation in return.<br/>

And the other reply was Right On - who would you sacrifice?!<br/>

font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:navy;">Our early letterboxing adventures (and
probably our current ones depending on how judgmental you are) were not the
most stealthy, but kids playing in the woods often makes a decent cover for our
activities.  Our first letterboxing hunt was with five kids ages 6 and
under, but we chose a park that wasn’t highly traveled.  Nobody was
around as we looked for the box.  One of our trips soon after that was
with a group of about 15 family members.  Disguised as a post-Thanksgiving
walk, we wandered another park looking for a box.</span></font></p>

thing” is one you hide yourself.  I’ll carve and send a stamp
if you can get more information.</span></font></p>
