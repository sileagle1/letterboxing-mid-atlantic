<br/>
</span></blockquote>This statement is demonstrably false.  (No offense,<br/>
its just the way I write :-)).<br/>
<br/>
I'm in 2 other outdoor activities where it doesn't happen,<br/>
and have been so for years.  There is a sense of community<br/>
in both.  There is certainly a sense of rivalry in the field,<br/>
but no sense of rivalry amongst the persons, who mostly go<br/>
out of their way to be friendly and civil, and genuinely care<br/>
about each other as persons.<br/>
<br/>
This hobby, by contrast, is characterized by nastiness,<br/>
cliqism, pettiness, one-upsmanship, and hypocrisy, as LB so<br/>
correctly demonstrated an instance of, and it is a shame<br/>
Cyclonic appears to have been the victim this time.  I've<br/>
reviewed the messages.  Absurd.<br/>
<br/>
Brendan accurately points out a proximate cause inasmuch<br/>
as people will self-stand-in for the other in an 80%<br/>
communication vacuum, but I see that as only a proximate<br/>
cause.  The ultimate cause, IMHO, of the nastiness and pettiness<br/>
in letterboxing is the quest for prestige -- to be the big fish<br/>
in the pond, regardless of how absurdly small and irrelevant<br/>
the pond happens to be.  Message to the prestige seekers --<br/>
no one cares.<br/>
<br/>
This list doesn't seem the place for this cat fight, and I<br/>
apologize to the moderator(s), but when you've been seeing<br/>
absurdity for years, and you feel Cyclonic warrants the<br/>
support in this case, it is difficult to hold one's peace.<br/>
<br/>
As an aside, it is interesting that a credible source has<br/>
suggested to me in the distant past that certain messages<br/>
posted on the list I manage have been a deliberate attempt<br/>
to devalue and destabilize that list in favor of those run<br/>
by associate(s) of the poster(s) in question.  Everyone loves<br/>
a good conspiracy theory, don't they?  I don't care enough<br/>
about it to have an opinion one way or the other, but it<br/>
seems possible that such a suggestion could pass the Occam's<br/>
Razor test when considering all the bizarre and senseless<br/>
facts in toto.<br/>
<br/>
Again, apologies to the moderator(s) and the rest of the<br/>
list.  I'll rant elsewhere going forward.  But some things<br/>
needed to be said.<br/>
