<p><br/>&gt; Any time you get any group of more than 2 people together<br/>&gt; 
  for any length of time it will happen. :)<br/><br/>This statement is 
  demonstrably false. (No offense,<br/>its just the way I write :-)).<br/><br/>I'm 
  in 2 other outdoor activities where it doesn't happen,<br/>and have been so for 
  years. There is a sense of community<br/>in both. There is certainly a sense of 
  rivalry in the field,<br/>but no sense of rivalry amongst the persons, who 
  mostly go<br/>out of their way to be friendly and civil, and genuinely 
  care<br/>about each other as persons.<br/><br/>This hobby, by contrast, is 
  characterized by nastiness,<br/>cliqism, pettiness, one-upsmanship, and 
  hypocrisy, as LB so<br/>correctly demonstrated an instance of, and it is a 
  shame<br/>Cyclonic appears to have been the victim this time. I've<br/>reviewed 
  the messages. Absurd.<br/><br/>Brendan accurately points out a proximate cause 
  inasmuch<br/>as people will self-stand-in for the other in an 
  80%<br/>communication vacuum, but I see that as only a proximate<br/>cause. The 
  ultimate cause, IMHO, of the nastiness and pettiness<br/>in letterboxing is the 
  quest for prestige -- to be the big fish<br/>in the pond, regardless of how 
  absurdly small and irrelevant<br/>the pond happens to be. Message to the 
  prestige seekers --<br/>no one cares.<br/><br/>This list doesn't seem the place 
  for this cat fight, and I<br/>apologize to the moderator(s) , but when 
  you've been seeing<br/>absurdity for years, and you feel Cyclonic warrants 
  the<br/>support in this case, it is difficult to hold one's peace.<br/><br/>As an 
  aside, it is interesting that a credible source has<br/>suggested to me in the 
  distant past that certain messages<br/>posted on the list I manage have been a 
  deliberate attempt<br/>to devalue and destabilize that list in favor of those 
  run<br/>by associate(s) of the poster(s) in question. Everyone loves<br/>a good 
  conspiracy theory, don't they? I don't care enough<br/>about it to have an 
  opinion one way or the other, but it<br/>seems possible that such a suggestion 
  could pass the Occam's<br/>Razor test when considering all the bizarre and 
  senseless<br/>facts in toto.<br/><br/>Again, apologies to the moderator(s) and 
  the rest of the<br/>list. I'll rant elsewhere going forward. But some 
  things<br/>needed to be said.<br/><br/>Randy<br/></p></div></blockquote></span></blockquote></html>
