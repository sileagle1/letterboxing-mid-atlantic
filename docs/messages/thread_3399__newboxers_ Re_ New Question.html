<div>since my post didn't make it through to the newboxers board yet 
        again, let me say this. 2 days ago, when i first posted something, it 
        got deleted. but not before a mass mailing to evevryone's mail box. then 
        i tried to post something else, but that didn't make the board. this 
        morning, noticing that mark is praising himself on the 4032 members on 
        that board and how only 6 left. we should all congratulate him on the 
        4026 that he assumes stand by his side. since this post will more than 
        likely be posted on this board than the original send and blocked yet 
        again on the newboxers board. anyone that really knows nathan 
        should post your support on the newboxers board before we all get 
        censored.</div>

<div>I left the newboxers list a year ago, I think.  Someone asked if it was okay to use store-bought stamps in a plant.  I replied [not really kidding, I guess], Sure, it's your box; you can do it however you want to.  But in your clues make sure you point out it's a store-bought stamp, so I won't bother looking for it.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Oy vey, the reaction was swift and sure!  I had apparently insulted mothers with small children, the handicapped, and anyone else who did not have the talent [?] or time to invest in carving.  </div>

<div>I decided maybe I wasn't a "newboxer" anymore or apparently kind enough to help them out, lol, so I left that list.</div>

Another fine example of why I try VERY hard not to waste any <br/>&gt; time from my ever shortening middle-aged life with all the crap that <br/>&gt; goes on around this hobby. Every once in a while I get sucked in as <br/>&gt; we all know, but most of the time I succeed. I often hear about the <br/>&gt; never ending crap from someone, or like this when it is referred to <br/>&gt; here, and I am light stuff compared to the crap that goes on ALL the <br/>&gt; time. I regret the times I do let my buttons get pushed. <br/>&gt; &gt; <br/>&gt; &gt; I will say that I see the same person LB referred to is still on <br/>&gt; the big list, ****FOUR YEARS LATER*** pushing people's buttons, and <br/>&gt; they are letting them be pushed. (I don't necessarily mean you LB--I <br/>&gt; didn't look at the big list--I know you were using it to make a <br/>&gt; point) Does this not tell us something??? It never changes and it is <br/>&gt; a waste of time and energy. <br/>&gt; &gt; <br/>&gt; &gt; I even wasted my time sitting here doing a big long note referring <br/>&gt; to all that stuff that happened on the newboxers list, after I <br/>&gt; checked it out, and then I said........ ........you know, it's not <br/>&gt; worth it. <br/>&gt; &gt; <br/>&gt; &gt; Missmoon.... ......... taking a deep zen breath and getting ready to <br/>&gt; go to work.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; <br/>&gt; <br/>&gt;  <br/>&gt; <br/>&gt; <br/>&gt; <br/>&gt; <br/>&gt; <br/>&gt; <br/>&gt; <br/>&gt; <br/>&gt; <br/>&gt; <br/>&gt; <br/>&gt; <br/>&gt; <br/>&gt; __________________________________________________<br/>&gt; Do You Yahoo!?<br/>&gt; Tired of spam?
