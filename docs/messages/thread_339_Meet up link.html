seems to be a comercial site for many other types of<br/>
groups bsides letterboxing. Has anyone ever been to<br/>
one of these meet-ups? How did letterboxing get on the<br/>

a "mini gathering" type of thing.  It's actually pretty cool.  <br/>
<br/>
I think I put the link up on the site so MORE people could get <br/>
involved with it and maybe start some type of letterboxing club or <br/>
group (in your own area) and have monthly meet ups, after all that is <br/>
what my intention was, to start a local letterboxing club type of <br/>
thing.  <br/>
<br/>
Since there are over 1,000 topics to choose from, maybe if there <br/>
aren't many letterboxers in your area there may be 10-100 people <br/>
interested in bookcrossing, ATC's, single parents, public speaking or <br/>
&lt;horrors&gt; even political issues!  <br/>
<br/>
Just my $.02 on this meet up thing  :}<br/>
