<div><font face="Arial" size="2">Okay, shameless commercialism, but I'm going to be 
in Philly in two weeks for and art show I'm having in Old City.  Some of 
the boxers I met had commented that they really liked exploring my web site link 
at the bottom of my posts.  So, for anyone who wants to come out, take a 
look at the real thing, say hello and put faces with all the signature 
stamps I see in the logs, I'll be happy to do exchanges at the gallery while I'm 
in town.</font></div>
<div><font face="Arial" size="2"></font> </div>
<div><font face="Arial" size="2">The show is called "Expressions of 
Time."  It's at Blink Gallery at 108 Chestnut St, 4th floor, 
Philadelphia.  The reception will be Friday, November 7th from 6 to 9 
PM.  The gallery is also open by appointment at (215) 588-4445, but I won't 
be the one there for appointments.  More information about the show is on 
my home page and I'll be happy to give directions, parking advice, etc. off 
list.</font></div>
