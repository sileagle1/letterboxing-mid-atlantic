Had to get creative on figuring out a way around all the flooded areas....  However that was one of the most creative events we have attended!<br/>

visitor's bullpen, underneath the standing room shelf against the <br/>
fence, you could have been Letterboxing!  Ok . . . prior to the <br/>
playoffs b/c I pulled Rollins Promise at the last regular season <br/>
game.  BUT stay tuned for Rollins Repeat in April of '09!  A 3 box, <br/>
in park series!!!<br/>
<br/>
BTW . . . I was in section 136, Row 29.  I might just have a picture <br/>
with you in it! :)<br/>
