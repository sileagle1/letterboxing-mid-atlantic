</span></blockquote>Is that the T&amp;E box in Double Trouble State Park? We couldn't find <br/>
that one last year, and when I contacted Elyse, she said she was <br/>
giving up letterboxing. Somehow, Hello Kitty (I think it was... <br/>
might be wrong) "inherited" the boxes on the LbNA list, although she <br/>
hadn't checked on all of them to "finalize the adoption". Maybe we <br/>
can all put our heads together at the October gathering to see that <br/>
all these great spots get adopted by locals and taken care of again.<br/>
