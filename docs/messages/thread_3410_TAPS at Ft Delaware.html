did at Eastern State Penitentiary.  <br/>
<br/>
I think that Dave Tango &amp; Dustin Pari are dumber than a bag of <br/>
hammers and a box of rox, respectively, and Paranormal State is far <br/>
creepier, but Ghost Hunters isn't bad at all.<br/>
<br/>
By 10 PM, the "panic button" that you could use to alert TAPS to <br/>
anything creepy had taken 170,000 hits.  I hit it, too, on the 50th <br/>
or 60th crotch shot, which was definitely frightening - acres of <br/>
historic and scary stuff but no, keep showing, well...<br/>
