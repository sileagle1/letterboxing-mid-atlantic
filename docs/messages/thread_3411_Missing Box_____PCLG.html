<div><font face="Arial" size="2">Oooh that was a good one.! When Dave was on Active 
Duty and I was coming down to visit, Dave picked me up at the train station and 
we went to find it on the way back to Fort Dix. It was a great site. Do love 
Gazebo boxes. Maybe I should plant one of my own.</font></div>
<div><font face="Arial" size="2">If any of you ever get up to Connecticut, you 
should try the Gazebo Series. They carved a bunch of stamps that depicted a part 
of a gazebo and planted them at different town gazebos in Eastern CT. We were 
able to do the whole series in one afternoon.</font></div>
