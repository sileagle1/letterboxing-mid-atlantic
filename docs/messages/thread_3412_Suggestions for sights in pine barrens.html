<br/>
Hmm...I happen to think the Ong's Hat box is placed in a great<br/>
location and the story of Ong's Hat is interesting as well.<br/>
It is right next to the Batona Trail - which is a terrific<br/>
way to see the Pine Barrens as well as being a great<br/>
jumping off spot for many of the forgotten spots of the Pines<br/>
- a lot of which are close by and can be found mentioned in <br/>
the books written by Father Beck as well as some other good<br/>
sources.  -John<br/>

&gt; ------------------------------------<br/>
&gt;   <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
</span></blockquote>There are plenty of neat boxes in the Pine Barrens, though most you have <br/>
to do a little research for before venturing out.<br/>
<br/>
I highly recommend Pine Barrens Tree Frog, Just Passing Through, and Oh, <br/>
Be My Friend.  All take you to very neat, mostly forgotten locations in <br/>
the Barrens.  There are a few others out there, I just can't mention <br/>
them more specifically.<br/>
<br/>
Some not so mysterious boxes include Terra-Cotta Tangram (highly <br/>
recommended), Ssssssss!, NJ Pysiography, Things to Do in the Pines <br/>
Series, and the Scary Vegetable NJ.  These boxes are near Chatsworth <br/>
which is  aneat little town in and of itself.  Be sure to visit the <br/>
general store.  Nearby is Whitesbog Village, a historic area with its <br/>
own neat general store.<br/>
<br/>
Batsto Village on the South end of the Barrens is well worth a visit as <br/>
well.  It is an old company town with a mansion, mill and the workings <br/>
of several Pine Barren industries.  There are also plenty of boxes in <br/>
the area, including the Bridges of Burlington County.<br/>
<br/>
Enjoy.<br/>

series.</font></div>
<div><font face="Arial" size="2">By the way, we are still searching for someone to 
adopt the series - they can keep using the boxes and the stamps and just add 
their own logbooks.We have been rather busy up here in RI and have not been able 
to come south to collect our logbooks. When we do we will leave the boxes in 
situ and leave generic logbooks. It is a great hike through the 
woods.</font></div>

  Barrens in next few <br/>&gt; days. Anyone have suggestions as to interesting 
  areas (Interesting w/ <br/>&gt; boxes would be better but just scenic is cool 
  too). <br/>&gt; Ong's Hat was a new &amp; interesting spot we visited recently. 
  Although <br/>&gt; box is in a blank (trail parking ) area, nearby are many 
  sharp things.<br/>&gt; Also while suggesting : :-) If interested in 
  Groundpiggy, Sidling <br/>&gt; Hill, Pa. Turnpike you may want to visit soon as 
  hide is a little <br/>&gt; iffy, but the vistas are great. Happy Hunting, m

  ------------ --------- --------- ------<br/>&gt; <br/><br/>There are 
  plenty of neat boxes in the Pine Barrens, though most you have <br/>to do a 
  little research for before venturing out.<br/><br/>I highly recommend Pine 
  Barrens Tree Frog, Just Passing Through, and Oh, <br/>Be My Friend. All take 
  you to very neat, mostly forgotten locations in <br/>the Barrens. There are a 
  few others out there, I just can't mention <br/>them more 
  specifically.<br/><br/>Some not so mysterious boxes include Terra-Cotta Tangram 
  (highly <br/>recommended) , Ssssssss!, NJ Pysiography, Things to Do in the 
  Pines <br/>Series, and the Scary Vegetable NJ. These boxes are near Chatsworth 
  <br/>which is aneat little town in and of itself. Be sure to visit the 
  <br/>general store. Nearby is Whitesbog Village, a historic area with its 
  <br/>own neat general store.<br/><br/>Batsto Village on the South end of the 
  Barrens is well worth a visit as <br/>well. It is an old company town with a 
  mansion, mill and the workings <br/>of several Pine Barren industries. There 
  are also plenty of boxes in <br/>the area, including the Bridges of Burlington 
  County.<br/><br/>Enjoy.<br/><br/>-- <br/>Nathan Brown<br/><br/>AKA
