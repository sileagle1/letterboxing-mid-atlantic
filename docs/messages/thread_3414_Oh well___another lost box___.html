aptly named "Key West Adventure" was reported as vandalized today and <br/>
was discarded by the finder. Apparently someone removed the contents <br/>
and left some type of 'gunk' inside the box. There are some really nice <br/>
people out there.... That makes 2 boxes in one week....and the week is <br/>
not over yet......<br/>
