Since I don't general hunt in your planting territory I hadn't copied<br/>
clues into Word (so I could apply a big font).  Too bad.<br/>
<br/>
But maybe others have some of your clues buried in their files.  Did<br/>
you not maintain drafts in your files or is it just the covert sneaky<br/>
burying in web sites that has you at a loss?<br/>
