<br/>
For those that know me you know I hate posting to these boards. But <br/>
this, I am passionate about.<br/>
<br/>
I called my Dad today to thank him for serving our Country and <br/>
say "Happy Veteran's Day". Dad AND Mom appreciated the call. I was the <br/>
only one of seven kids that remembered. Please don't forget the service <br/>
these men and women have done for us, regardless of your stance on <br/>
politics. It takes a moment, but means so much...<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for listening, back to lurking.<br/>
