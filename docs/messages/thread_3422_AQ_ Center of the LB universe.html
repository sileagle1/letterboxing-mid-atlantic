                    <div id="ygrps-yiv-108224836">That reminds me of the time I was letterboxing in Georgia, a few summers ago.  The town has several parks connected by a greenway;  both parks and the trail had boxes for which I was hunting.  Some of the stretches of trail were more popular than others, and at one point I found myself following a gentleman with a backpack and trekking pole.  I was walking faster than him, but kept getting behind when I would stop to snag a box.  There was no one else around and we were not close to any of the parks, so I started wondering if he was the placer of one of the boxes I was after.  I was catching up again and contemplating asking him if he was a boxer when he came out of the woods in a place that did not match any of my clues - so I assumed he was a geocacher...  But after finding the box for which I was looking, I wandered over to where he'd been, and found a letterbox!  No one had stamped in recently, so I assume he was the placer, doing a check, but by then he was gone.  I've never seen the box listed anywhere, nor have I found anything posted by that trail name, so it was truly a surrendipitous find.  The box, appropriately, was named "Joy"<br/>

My pet peeve is being able to list WOM boxes. Just doen't make sense to me. To me it is like saying nanny nanny boo boo I have a box but you can't have it. The one thing I really did like about AQ was the event listing but now it's so cluttered with yard sales and tupperware parties it's hard to find what is a gather and what is not. I've said too much, why am I so cranky this morning?<br/>

&gt; I don't usually chime in on these threads, but this<br/>
&gt; subject I find interesting since there seems to be much<br/>
&gt; distain regarding AQ with many of the 'Old timer"<br/>
&gt; letterboxers.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; As a letterboxing newbie (been at it for only two years<br/>
&gt; now), where does one go to find these "so many clues<br/>
&gt; hosted on neither AQ nor LbNA"? WoM's are great,<br/>
&gt; but hard to come by.  While I find that both sites are<br/>
&gt; littered with boxes that aren't worth reading the clues<br/>
&gt; let alone going out to find the plant, they are the most<br/>
&gt; accessible way to find boxes, plan &amp; track events, plan<br/>
&gt; for travel, or keep logs for plants and finds (without fear<br/>
&gt; of losing them as I have read about happening to others on<br/>
&gt; this chat group).<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Seems like the mass usage of these sites makes them the<br/>
&gt; "Center of the Letterboxing Universe" (perhaps the<br/>
&gt; mass usage is the reason for the distain).  Am I wrong to<br/>
&gt; guess that most letterboxers (Old or New) spend most of<br/>
&gt; their searching time on these two sites??  Of course, being<br/>
&gt; the center does not mean that policies of this hobby are set<br/>
&gt; there, but I can see why so many think that they are the<br/>
&gt; place to look for "the letterboxing codes and<br/>
&gt; rules".<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; For me, "There are no rules only personal choices,<br/>
&gt; it's letterboxing after all."<br/>

<br/>
</span></blockquote>Here is the thing that I have found over the past year or so, it doesn't <br/>
matter.  Really, it doesn't matter what others say or do because the <br/>
future of the hobby is what you, personally, make it.<br/>
<br/>
I read the boards on AQ mostly because it is like watching a train <br/>
wreck.  Very often, when I post, whatever I say, my opinion, gets <br/>
lambasted.  People don't get it, or are just plain ignorant, as to why I <br/>
post things.<br/>
<br/>
For example, in the thread that Rick here was first talking about, <br/>
personally, I think the listings for boxes that are abandoned by folks <br/>
not coming back to the site should be deleted.  I think only the planter <br/>
of the box has any rights to ownership of a box and that the box should <br/>
never be forcibly given to someone else, even if that someone else will <br/>
take care of the box or the box will simply become trash in the woods.  <br/>
It is amazing how many folks seem to think it is OK to steal someone <br/>
else's box, change the clues or the box or both.  Heck, I used to even <br/>
think that, so I do somewhat understand, but sometimes a box simply has <br/>
to die.<br/>
<br/>
I could go on and on about the stupid things that go on there, and are <br/>
said there, but really, what difference does it make, that is not going <br/>
to change, and at least there are functions to ignore most of the <br/>
non-sense. <br/>
<br/>
This is not to say that there is not good as well.  The new groups <br/>
function has opened up lots of new options on box clue ideas and the <br/>
sharing of thoughts and opinions.  But I think that the sharing of those <br/>
ideas, and the good that can come of it, is far overshadowed by the <br/>
nonsense and utter stupidity that goes on.  That is why a list like this <br/>
still works so well, and will continue to work so well.<br/>
<br/>
I just find myself totally disgusted by how so many seem to worship Ryan <br/>
and everything he does.  At least I know he doesn't like it either, <br/>
unlike other list owners that seem to relish being propped up as such.<br/>
<br/>
The original purpose of the site, to be able to more easily search for <br/>
box clues, is great, and works well.  I often wonder, however, just how <br/>
many people use the site for that purpose, and how many simply use the <br/>
site to gab about any and everything.  I ignore most of it, and go about <br/>
planting and finding my boxes, but I see very few people out there <br/>
finding even the simplest of my own boxes, and often wonder if the site <br/>
is really about letterboxing anymore.<br/>

<br/>
While the event listings were revamped no long ago, they are still <br/>
ridiculous, and some of the junk that is posted as an event just does <br/>
not belong.  When you first open the events page, for instance, the <br/>
first three things are not gatherings at all, but are appeals to <br/>
charity.  While that is all well and good, are these really gatherings?<br/>
