Next day no such luck. Nice clues, but I think the planters were one hit wonders. I did n't see <br/>
any other boxes planted by them. Clues ended in a rather high impact area with a set of <br/>
stone steps. Many little hidey holes but far too obvious.<br/>
On another note... Decided to clean out carving drawer, sort, finish things started, ect. Came <br/>
upon half carved stamp of Mastercarve or should I say Mastercrap. I now know why I didn't <br/>
finish the stamp in the first place. Yes it cuts like butter but way to easy to over shoot line or <br/>
undercut. Just orderd some PZcut grade B white.</div>
