                    <div id="ygrps-yiv-401123838">Well, first a few updates.  For those interested, I planted a new box <br/>
earlier this week, "Winter in Bucks" <br/>
(<a href="http://www.penncoasters.com/letterboxing/winter.htm)" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.penncoasters.com/letterboxing/winter.htm)</a>. This is a limited <br/>
time only box that will be available only until January 6.  Afterwards <br/>
there will be a permanent box planted at that location.<br/>
<br/>
I have also finally changed and updated "Beast from the Barrens" <br/>
(<a href="http://www.penncoasters.com/letterboxing/beast.htm)" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.penncoasters.com/letterboxing/beast.htm)</a>.  It is in a new <br/>
location and the clues have been altered.  This box is a favorite of <br/>
mine and the clues are based on a true story.<br/>
<br/>
Schizokeet and I had a nice weekend, though we went boxing on only one <br/>
day this weekend.  We went in search on the new Remembering 9/11 series <br/>
in Lower Makefield at the Garden of Reflection.  A very nice park.  The <br/>
clues turned out to be more challenging then we expected and Becky <br/>
needed the facilities before we found the last box.  The hides are very <br/>
well done.<br/>
<br/>
We then made our way to Lambertville to get some beer at River Horse, <br/>
then across the river where Bowman's Tower was actually open (five bucks <br/>
to go up, forget that!) and my box is still in great shape. We then <br/>
headed home to have an early dinner before watching a tree lighting with <br/>
fireworks, which made Becky very happy.<br/>
<br/>
We also ran into other boxers on the trail.  We are sitting, logging <br/>
into the first box, when I see folks off into the woods.  I say they <br/>
look like they are letterboxing, I think they have clues.  Becky says, <br/>
no, they are way over there and would have gotten this box already, but <br/>
we are first finders (nice little FF prizes BTW, Becky liked).  They <br/>
must be geocaching, they are looking under every log, stump and tree.  <br/>
They get really close to us, within 50 feet, and still do not see us <br/>
(this is why stealth is overrated), and finally Becky calls over to them.<br/>
<br/>
Turns out they are out of town boxers, Snap Z from NYC and Sunny Sal <br/>
from Maryland.  They are headed to NY and boxing along the way, and not <br/>
having much luck with this series.  They had skipped the first three <br/>
boxes having not been able to find them, and were looking for the forth <br/>
(which would be difficult because you would need to find the first three <br/>
first to find the forth).  So we got exchanges and went on to find two <br/>
of the other three boxes while they continued to poke around for the <br/>
second box.<br/>
<br/>
Speaking of seeing folks on the trail, I hear Celtic Cat and Wednesday <br/>
Bowler ran into an interesting fellow on trail on Sunday.<br/>
