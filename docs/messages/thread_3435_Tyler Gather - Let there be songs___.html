<br/>
I am sorry I missed yous, I guess we were on trail at the time.  Did <br/>
enjoy meeting the Soul Mates and Kibbles T Dibbles as well.  It was a <br/>
fun time, as usual, with some eeevil about, loads of food, a warm fire, <br/>
and some nice company while hiking. <br/>
<br/>
The party afterwards at Issac Newtons was a blast as well.  I even saw <br/>
Shelly Doberman!<br/>
<br/>
Great as usual, and I think the pavilion would be just fine again, gives <br/>
me a reason to hit the trail and it is free!<br/>

&gt;   Subject: [lbma] Tyler Gather - Let there be songs...<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt;         A heartfelt thanks to everyone who braved the cold to <br/>
attend my annual "freeze you @$$ off" gather at Tyler State Park. <br/>
Dude and I got to see so many of our dear friends and make new ones, <br/>
which is always a huge kick for us! Thanks to everyone who brought <br/>
food, wood and thier warm friendship to my little neck of the woods. <br/>
A special shout out to Sowsewbizzy and the Red Hats who pretty much <br/>
refused to let this gather not happen when I was feeling pretty blue <br/>
and was thinking of cancelling. Next thing I know I see emails <br/>
flying back and forth and who's bringing this and making that and I <br/>
decided I guess I just better suck it up and attend my own gather! <br/>
What a wonderful bunch of broads, the absolute best.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt;         Good news is next year the gather will be at the Hostel in <br/>
Tyler park, so that means indoors with HEAT and a fireplace! We'll <br/>
work out parking and food logistics later.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt;         So thanks again, turns out a day in the woods freezing my <br/>
tookus off with the best people on the planet was just what the <br/>
doctor ordered!<br/>

<br/>
This is kibblesTDibbles, aka Donald.  I Just wanted to say hello, and <br/>
thank H&amp;H and others who planned the event.  I had a great day, even if <br/>
I looked a little out of my element.  I really enjoyed meeting everyone <br/>
and getting some awesome exchanges.  I've Been thinking I'd try to <br/>
carve a stamp of two butts-up swans for next year's event.  Trying to <br/>
find a picture of swans with their butts sticking out of the water has <br/>
proven challenging though.<br/>
<br/>
Allright.  See you guys soon, on the trail or on a thread about ABBA. <br/>
<br/>
