visiting Lewes for, say, the Polar Bear Plunge, or the Lower Slower <br/>
Stagger.<br/>
<br/>
Back in June, we received a report that the log book had been found <br/>
in the open and the remainder of the box found not at all.  This kind <br/>
boxer mailed our log book back, which is nice to have from a dead box.<br/>
<br/>
We guessed that some kind of critter had pulled the box apart and <br/>
carried it off, so we recarved and finally had a chance to replant.<br/>
<br/>
The story gets a bit weird, though.<br/>
<br/>
We found our original box under a different branch of the same tree, <br/>
wet but closed, with the stamp intact and two sheets of paper with <br/>
personal stamps on them.<br/>
<br/>
OK, so the log somehow leaves the box and winds up on the sand...and <br/>
then other boxers find the box and create a temporary log...but the <br/>
box itself was never pulled apart, carried off, or destroyed, just <br/>
temporarily missing back in June.<br/>
<br/>
If Natalie H or A. H. read this list or if anyone knows them, we'd <br/>
love to hear from them in the hope of rounding out this tale a bit.</div>
