homeschooling sons and I'm the Service Unit Manager for the Girl Scouts <br/>
of Pemberton Township.<br/>

We went looking for the Bicycle Railroad boxes in Smithville, NJ, but it <br/>
seems they were either washed away in the summer floods, or removed by <br/>
the reconstruction crews now working the whole area. We've been trying to <br/>
contact the placer, Backpacking Bear, to no avail. Is the placer on this <br/>
list?<br/>
<br/>
Since the NJ Physiography 104 box is in Smithville Historic Park, has <br/>
anyone recently confirmed it is safe and sound?<br/>
<br/>
Looking forward to talking with y'all about our adventures!<br/>
<br/>
