A great day and I am glad that we did the actual walk for the latex <br/>
and used the Sheeba as a good sounding board for the ideas we <br/>
conceived.  Most amazing was the name of the Park Ranger who was very <br/>
helpful and informative.  I think BS is going back with a metal <br/>

&gt; Well, there was a least one box where it was "we haven't solved the <br/>
clues but if you remember where it is can you take us there?"  And we <br/>
made the Vulture go fetch that one.  So I think our slackboxing rep <br/>
still holds.  On the other hand MizS assisted with some of the higher-<br/>
elevation boxes....<br/>

&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; Went on great winter's day hike with a group of intrepid boxers. <br/>
We<br/>
&gt; covered 11 miles over <br/>
&gt; &gt; the course of the day. Box count was 7 and 3 attempts. A few of <br/>
the<br/>
&gt; boxes were of a historic <br/>
&gt; &gt; nature, letterboxing history that is. Interesting to see clue<br/>
&gt; development and box placement <br/>
&gt; &gt; morph over a period of years.<br/>
&gt; &gt; Would I have covered so much ground on my own? No way! We would <br/>
have<br/>
&gt; gone farther but <br/>
&gt; &gt; in theses days of winter the boxers day is cut short.<br/>

&gt; Hiking 11 miles in the cold is not slack boxing missy.   lol <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; We have to come up with a term that describes boxing that falls <br/>
between slacking and not slacking. And if you say slacking often <br/>
enough it starts to sound dirty. LOL <br/>

&gt;   No, I was still slack boxing.Dearest Sheba had figured out the <br/>
clues and we just followed along. Other boxes were mine or ones I had <br/>
found before. Although I do think hiking the whole clue instead of <br/>
just being shown where the box is from a convenient parking place <br/>
does somewhat assuage the slack boxing.<br/>
