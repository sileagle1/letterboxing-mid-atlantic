<br/>
We are going to be there this Saturday, and if anyone is interested in <br/>
coming, you can meet up with me and I will have special clues to a day <br/>
only African penguin box. There are also lots of other neat animals to <br/>
see at the zoo, including Scimitar horned oryx and golden crowned <br/>
cranes, both endangered species. I also have my box in the zoo and <br/>
there are boxes on the nature trails that are on the way out.<br/>
<br/>
This is the special box (and the stamp came out really well!)<br/>

<br/>
I will have my PTs and if I have time, I will be planting a new stamp <br/>
that I just carved yesterday.<br/>
<br/>
Please contact me if you are planning on coming so we can work out a <br/>
time and place to meet up in the zoo.<br/>
