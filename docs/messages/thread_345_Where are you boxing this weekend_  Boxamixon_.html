and checked in on my Reading Pagoda box, and all were fine.<br/>
<br/>
Our Letterbox Rescue Mission program also scored another success. We <br/>
recovered and adopted a forgotten box from the letterbox basement, the <br/>
Exeter Scenic Trail Rocks in Gibraltar, PA. It hadn't been visited for a <br/>
year, but it was in fine shape. The clues are now available at:<br/>
<a href="http://www.letterboxing.info/box/diverdm/exeter.php" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.letterboxing.info/box/diverdm/exeter.php</a><br/>
<br/>
Unfortunately, we didn't have as much luck with two other abandoned boxes: <br/>
The Eagle in Reading is definitely gone, and our search for Stream vs. Road <br/>
in Birdsboro was inconclusive. (If anyone has any information on Stream vs. <br/>
Road, please let me know!).<br/>
<br/>
We closed out the day by spending nearly 4 hours at Nolde Forest searching <br/>
for shredmtb's 3-box series in the park there. It was fiendishly clever, <br/>
and kept us busy, both from a hiking and brainpower perspective, and we <br/>
both found it to be one of the most satisfying (and exhausting!) <br/>
letterboxing forays in recent history. We highly recommend it to anyone <br/>
who's looking for a new challenge!<br/>

seeing all the historical sites I snuck in some bosing and found <br/>
that the Mint eagle box and three of the four Ben Franklin series <br/>
were alive and well. I was disappointed though, I went looking for <br/>
the eastern state pen. LB and found that it was MIA.  After such an <br/>
interesting place I was very excited to find a box but found it was <br/>
missing.  I looked for the placer in order to contact them but could <br/>

Here's what we found (and didn't), starting with boxes in NJ:<br/>
<br/>
National Mystery Letterbox Project: New Jersey<br/>
	(Does everyone know about this box? It's not been visited very often, I <br/>
guess cause it's kinda hidden on letterboxing.org. You can find the clues here:<br/>
<a href="http://embers.cox.net/ae4mk/letterbox/nj_NMLBP.htm" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://embers.cox.net/ae4mk/letterbox/nj_NMLBP.htm</a> )<br/>
Van Wickle House (note to Aud: sometimes boards used for bridges get too <br/>
weathered and must be patched)<br/>
NJ Physiography 103<br/>
Delaware &amp; Raritan Canal North<br/>
Big Green Monster #1 &amp; 2<br/>
Music to My Ears Mystery<br/>
<br/>
We didn't find the Delaware &amp; Raritan Canal Griggstown box, and we're <br/>
pretty sure it's gone.<br/>
<br/>
Then, we came back to PA and found:<br/>
Canal Bridge<br/>
Scudder Falls Bridge<br/>
<br/>
We met Warcat 76 as they were hiking back from Canal Bridge -- they first <br/>
noticed the paper in our hands, and then the LbNA patch on the back of my <br/>
pack was the verification they needed to confirm that we were letterboxers, <br/>
too! We exchanged stamps there on the canal towpath.<br/>
<br/>
Whew! It's been a busy long weekend....<br/>

Unfortunately, the page that's linked from the Eastern PA clue page on the <br/>
LbNA site doesn't give you any indication of its status. But it has been <br/>
discussed several times here in the group....<br/>

We'll definitely try that one again, now that the heat seems over. <br/>
We were also having trouble telling real paths from "desire lines" <br/>
(Do you know which mystery box used to be across the street and down <br/>
the road a bit???? my favorite find, ever)<br/>
<br/>
I think the hitch in finding the NJ National Box now is not only <br/>
that the clue is elusive, but also that not all of the mystery boxes <br/>
on which the clue was based are still active. <br/>

plywood. And it's not really visible from the woodchip path, particularly <br/>
with the summer growth in full bloom.<br/>

&gt;We were also having trouble telling real paths from "desire lines"<br/>
&gt;(Do you know which mystery box used to be across the street and down<br/>
&gt;the road a bit???? my favorite find, ever)<br/>
<br/>
</span></blockquote>Hmmm, I don't think so -- but Jen was driving and the directions from the <br/>
organization's web site were completely off due to construction, so I <br/>
wouldn't have probably noticed anyway!<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;I think the hitch in finding the NJ National Box now is not only<br/>
&gt;that the clue is elusive, but also that not all of the mystery boxes<br/>
&gt;on which the clue was based are still active.<br/>
<br/>
</span></blockquote>Could be an interesting conundrum, for sure! I probably have all the old <br/>
mystery box clues, so if anyone needs one that's not still available, let <br/>
me know.<br/>
