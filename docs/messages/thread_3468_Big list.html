That would probably do it for me too. I have to say, all of the pub<br/>
boxes are good for the RHB's. We usually buy appetizers and the<br/>
featured drink which is invariably called something like How to Stuff<br/>
a Wild Bikini.<br/>

&gt; &gt; One man's pub box is another man's beer. Or<br/>
&gt; &gt; something. That makes no sense at all but I'm still here<br/>
&gt; &gt; with a bum foot bored so it will have to do.<br/>

&gt; &gt;   Wow... as a result of your (this) post I went over and<br/>
&gt; &gt; tried to catch <br/>
&gt; &gt;   up... looks like a new letterboxer asked a question...<br/>
&gt; &gt; then a bunch of <br/>
&gt; &gt;   seasoned letterboxers couldn't agree on the tone of<br/>
&gt; &gt; the answer<br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt;   Then I saw something flare up over "pub letterboxes<br/>
&gt; &gt; and lazy" that <br/>
&gt; &gt;   interested me... but going back and trying to read ten<br/>
&gt; &gt; days worth of <br/>
&gt; &gt;   posts doesn't seem worth the effort....<br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt;   But I love Pub Letterboxes... found a good one yesterday!<br/>

&gt; &gt;   &gt; There was alot of back and forth going on and some<br/>
&gt; &gt; one posted we <br/>
&gt; &gt;   should just be nice to <br/>
&gt; &gt;   &gt; each other yada yada. I was so tempted to post<br/>
&gt; &gt; "if you can't run with <br/>
&gt; &gt;   the big dogs then stay <br/>
&gt; &gt;   &gt; on the porch". But I'm just not prepared<br/>
&gt; &gt; for the flames. Also I <br/>
&gt; &gt;   suppose it's a little childish and <br/>
&gt; &gt;   &gt; I really don't want to fan the flames.<br/>
