<br/>
Yes, I do plan to attend the Palmyra gathering with my family tribe. As <br/>
for refreshments, I have a garage full of Girl Scout cookies I could <br/>
bring...has anyone got a preference? (Thin Mints are gone, but I have <br/>
just about everything else!)<br/>
<br/>
I learned about letterboxing from the AllGirlScouts Yahoo list.<br/>
<br/>
For my introduction to letterboxing, I printed the clues to two boxes in <br/>
Western Maryland, bought a ton of carving material and supplies, and <br/>
brought the whole kit and caboodle to my week-long family reunion a few <br/>
weeks ago. I had the whole family -- four generations, aged 6 to 83! -- <br/>
carving erasers around the table. Then most of us set out to find the <br/>
Meadow Mountain box in Deep Creek Lake State Park. After a wonderful hike <br/>
on Indian Turnip Trail, we found the "solitary tree," but found no <br/>
letterbox under the stump. My cousins checked every stump in a <br/>
hundred-foot radius, just to be sure we weren't missing it. We were <br/>
disappointed, but we did enjoy the hike, and we carved our own Meadow <br/>
Mountain stamp when we got back to the house.<br/>
<br/>
The next day, everyone who wasn't sore from the previous day's hike went <br/>
to find Swallow Falls Swallow, and it was there! Beautiful hike, gorgeous <br/>
place!<br/>
<br/>
So far, since getting home, we've found Victory and Captain Moore's <br/>
Insignia (Washington Crossing Historical Park, PA), Scudders Falls Bridge <br/>
(Yardley, PA), and NJ Physiography 104 (Smithville, NJ). We've gone <br/>
looking for the two Smithville Bicycle Railroad boxes, but they were <br/>
washed away in the summer floods, so we carved our own stamp with a <br/>
picture of H. B. Smith's Star Bicycle on it.<br/>
<br/>
My trail name is She Shines. Looking forward to meeting y'all in Palmyra!<br/>
<br/>
