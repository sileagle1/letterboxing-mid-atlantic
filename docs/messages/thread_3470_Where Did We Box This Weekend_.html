<br/>
Schizokeet and I are happily (OK, very happily) moved in at this point, <br/>
but had been so busy we had not had the chance to really get out until <br/>
early last week.<br/>
<br/>
On Tuesday we went looking for Ostrich Love, which we had no luck <br/>
finding, but we did find a mystery box in the same park, which had great <br/>
clues that seemed to just piece themselves together.  I love it when <br/>
that happens.<br/>
<br/>
Sunday we ventured into the cold and found Suburban Sanctuary.  Nice <br/>
boxes, and we decided to complete the walk along the trail the boxes <br/>
were on.  Had a great time, as did the two families playing hockey on <br/>
the frozen pond there.<br/>
<br/>
Last night we meat with a few locals at a pub from some drinks, a great <br/>
meal, but no darts as the board was removed.  We still had fun though, <br/>
and it was nice to greet Mt Scorpia from NC, she is some character.<br/>
<br/>
Today we ventured once again into the cold and found Suburban <br/>
Recreation.  Again, a nice walk, and Schizokeet also planted her 20th box.<br/>
<br/>
Hope yous who have signed up for the mystery gathering are having fun <br/>
with the clues and boxes ;-)  It should be a lot of fun, though I have a <br/>
lot of work to do this week.<br/>
