 ripped the bags to open them, sometimes leaving them on the ground, while replacing everything in the box.  In that case I'm not embarrassed to assume.)</div>
<div> </div>
<div>If we think of this in terms of the "costs" of preventing the box from being damaged, who is the "cheapest cost avoider"?  If the placer is putting demands on finders that will predictably lead to damage, perhaps it's time to rethink replacement.  Where the spot is no better or worse than several others, and finders in the field are just making boneheaded errors, what's the best way of "idiot proofing" the boxes?  </div>

don't usually say anything if the box is in the open.  To me, it is a <br/>
non-issue because the box was still there.  I just carefully rehide it <br/>
and go on my way.  The planter doesn't need to know that information <br/>
unless there is a really good reason, like, for instance it is hidden in <br/>
a critter's hole or in a flood prone spot.<br/>
