Check out DecoDiva's boxes - amazing stamps and clever hides - and the <br/>
clues are hosted on her own site and the ones that are missing are so <br/>
indicated. Paper Boy should still be there, as should Porter Library and <br/>
Belmont: An Artist's Retreat. For many, many more F'burg/Spotsylvania <br/>
boxes, check Atlas Quest. A couple of very prolific and talented boxers <br/>
have recently relocated to the area and have been planting steadily. Enjoy!<br/>

&gt; Hi all,<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I will be in Virginia this weekend visiting my son (the marine)and my<br/>
&gt; grand daughters. I am having a mini meet and greet at the Belle Cafe on<br/>
&gt; 3869 Jefferson Davis Hwy in Stafford. I would love to meet anyone who<br/>

&gt; while I am there. I asked KnightsofColumbo to post on the LBMA group<br/>

&gt; Also if you know of some boxes that I just have to do while I am in<br/>
&gt; this area please let me know.. or if there are some that are missing<br/>
&gt; but not posted as such I would appreciate your input.<br/>
