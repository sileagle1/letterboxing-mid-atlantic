&gt; Veddy interesting. If you''re not already aware of<br/>

&gt; <br/>
&gt; This is something being seriously considered in Oregon and<br/>

&gt; It basically turns driving into a utility. And you get<br/>

short on details, since this seems to be something that is just now being

states, simply because it has *occurred* to the various local governments that 
this would be dandy a way to raise cash. And once something like that comes up, 
it never goes away. </font></div>

<div><font face="Arial" size="2">I don't think the Mass. article mentions anything 
about reducing the tax, just posing the fee?? And it really doesn't give any 
details at all about the other states, just mentions they have discussed it. And 
who knows how many changes one of these proposals would go through before it 
actually winds up in the policians' laps? One never knows. I would imagine that 
if at some point any state did do something this, the GPS would be required.

<div><font face="Arial" size="2">As people who's hobby depends on driving almost all <br/><br/>the time, I think this is something letterboxers should be aware of and stay on <br/><br/>top of. Maybe write to your local represenatives, senators?</font></div><br/><br/>

&gt; I read one of the articles, which seemed short on details.  The<br/>
&gt; indication was that the intent was to replace gas taxes, meaning<br/>
&gt; it is possible the proposal is revenue neutral, and thus nothing<br/>
&gt; to worry about if you drive an "average" vehicle (speculatively,<br/>
&gt; drivers of fuel-efficient cars would be hurt, drivers of Hummers<br/>
&gt; would benefit).  But, without any details, it is all speculation<br/>
&gt; and FUD, meaning writing to legislators might be premature.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; My guess is that the drop in demand for gas (and hence revenue<br/>
&gt; from gas taxes), as more to do with the depression rather than<br/>
&gt; more fuel-efficient vehicles, but I don't have the data to back<br/>
&gt; that up.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Keep in mind that it has been demonstrated that raising taxes<br/>
&gt; during an economic depression is a bad idea.  Will governments<br/>
&gt; repeat the mistakes of history?  I guess we'll see.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Also keep in mind that the president just signed legislation that<br/>
&gt; will increase funding for highway repair; it remains to be seen<br/>
&gt; whether such legislation will take pressure off states to raise<br/>
&gt; revenue for this purpose, and thus take pressure off this <br/>
initiative.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; As for big brother concerns, at least the article I read indicated<br/>
&gt; an opt out ability by not buying a GPS and thus continuing to pay<br/>
&gt; gas taxes.  Sounds like shopper bonus cards to me.  Again, short on<br/>
&gt; details, so all speculation.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
