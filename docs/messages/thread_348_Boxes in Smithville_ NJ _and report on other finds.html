<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;We went looking for the Bicycle Railroad boxes in Smithville, NJ, but it<br/>

&gt;contact the placer, Backpacking Bear, to no avail. Is the placer on this<br/>
&gt;list?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Since the NJ Physiography 104 box is in Smithville Historic Park, has<br/>
&gt;anyone recently confirmed it is safe and sound?<br/>
<br/>
</span></blockquote>Jennifer and I found Bicycle Railroad #2 and the Physiography 104 today.<br/>
<br/>
Bicycle Railroad #1 is indeed missing (Jennifer confirms, as she had found <br/>
it previously) -- but #2 is safe and sound in the right location.<br/>
<br/>
We also found Halcyon Pelican's Nature Center Series in Burlington County <br/>
with no trouble, and they're in good shape.<br/>
