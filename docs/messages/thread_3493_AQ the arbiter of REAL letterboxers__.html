</span></blockquote>Yeah, he logs the boxes that are posted on AQ so they disappear from <br/>
his lists.  He doesn't bother logging all our other finds that AREN'T <br/>
on AQ.  I guess maybe those finds aren't considered REAL?  <br/>
<br/>
As I've said before, I think of AQ as more of a "rubber stamping" site <br/>
than a letterboxing site.  Therefore I think it is hilarious that it <br/>
decides who is "really a letterboxer"!<br/>

&gt; Miz Scarlet is right.  There are no rules, just get out<br/>
&gt; there and box.  Make em' hard, make em' easy, make<br/>
&gt; them unaccessible, make them for everyone, make people hike,<br/>
&gt; do a drive by, get em' at events, make them puzzles,<br/>
&gt; give straightforward directions.  Post them, don't post<br/>
&gt; them, record them, don't record them, use AQ, don't<br/>
&gt; use AQ, use LBNA, don't use LBNA, put restrictions on<br/>
&gt; them, don't put restrictions on them, use people's<br/>
&gt; personal webpages or not.  Just Box.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; To each his own, do what makes you happy.  To me that<br/>
&gt; qualifies you as a letterboxer.  Not how long you have been<br/>
&gt; doing it or how many you have found or planted.<br/>

</span></blockquote>Ok, I'll play devil's advocate then, without actually looking at the<br/>
clue in question or being familiar with the individual.  These<br/>
comments are intended to be abstract.<br/>
<br/>
How would one feel of a box with a restriction that only those of<br/>
San descent [choose your ethnicity here] were permitted or not<br/>
permitted to find it?  Suppose some web site were programmed to<br/>
enforce these ethnic restrictions?<br/>
<br/>
Of course the creator can do what they want, and put such a restriction<br/>
on it.  Of course the creator can use a web site that enforces such<br/>
restrictions.  There are no rules.  But, would such be offensive? (note<br/>
there is a difference between "rules" and "social etiquette").<br/>
<br/>
I think it would be offensive to some people.  Would it be offensive<br/>
to a preponderance of the letterboxing population?  Would it be<br/>
"crossing a line"?  Who knows?  This is only a thought experiment.<br/>
<br/>
My opinion is that you "cross the line" when you place restrictions<br/>
outside the problem domain of the box or clue.  Requiring someone to<br/>
find 10 unrelated boxes, or be a member of some group or web site<br/>
is outside the problem domain of most boxes, and thus I find it<br/>
offensive.  Requiring people to find _that_ clue, or solve rock<br/>
trivia questions related to a particular clue, however, are inside<br/>
the problem domain of that and related boxes, and thus are not<br/>
offensive.  Solving the mystery of a mystery box is fine, being<br/>
San or joining some web site is not.<br/>
<br/>
It is all about line drawing, and perhaps some (perhaps a very tiny<br/>
minority), find that this sort of thing crosses it.<br/>
<br/>

&gt; &gt; Miz Scarlet is right. There are no rules, just get out<br/>
&gt; &gt; there and box. Make em' hard, make em' easy, make<br/>
&gt; &gt; them unaccessible, make them for everyone, make people hike,<br/>
&gt; &gt; do a drive by, get em' at events, make them puzzles,<br/>

&gt; &gt; them, record them, don't record them, use AQ, don't<br/>
&gt; &gt; use AQ, use LBNA, don't use LBNA, put restrictions on<br/>
&gt; &gt; them, don't put restrictions on them, use people's<br/>

<div>Comparisons to discrete and insular minorities of the sort described in footnote 4 of <em>Carolene Products</em>, or racial and ethnic distinctions of any kind, seem inapt here.  The filter at issue is based not on innate characteristics such as race, gender, age, etc., but on conduct on a web page open to those of any race, religion, or creed.  That filter is at least as porous as one in which, say, clues are posted in recipes on a cooking site that requires registration.  And, while, for example, most people would be offended by a rule that only San could practice medicine, few would object to education and licensing requirements.  One might object to certain licensing requirements as pointless, ineffective, or otherwise misguided, but that's another issue.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>There is a tightrope balance here between equality of access to clues and opportunity to solve them (and I agree that a level playing field is something to strive for as a placer), and secrecy.  It's not just a suspicion of The Man.  Secrets are fun.  </div>
<div> </div>
<div>Telling people that you have a secret that you do not plan to share with them, though, is not only obnoxious, but counterproductive.  That's where our friend from the Sunshine State went off the rails.</div>

<div>How would one feel of a box with a restriction that only those of<br/>San descent [choose your ethnicity here] were permitted or not<br/>permitted to find it? Suppose some web site were programmed to<br/>enforce these ethnic restrictions?<br/><br/>Of course the creator can do what they want, and put such a restriction<br/>on it. Of course the creator can use a web site that enforces such<br/>restrictions. There are no rules. But, would such be offensive? (note<br/>there is a difference between "rules" and "social etiquette").<br/><br/>I think it would be offensive to some people. Would it be offensive<br/>to a preponderance of the letterboxing population? Would it be<br/>"crossing a line"? Who knows? This is only a thought experiment.<br/><br/>My opinion is that you "cross the line" when you place restrictions<br/>outside the problem domain of the box or clue. Requiring someone to<br/>find 10 unrelated boxes, or be a member of some group or web site<br/>is outside
 the problem domain of most boxes, and thus I find it<br/>offensive. Requiring people to find _that_ clue, or solve rock<br/>trivia questions related to a particular clue, however, are inside<br/>the problem domain of that and related boxes, and thus are not<br/>offensive. Solving the mystery of a mystery box is fine, being<br/>San or joining some web site is not.<br/><br/>It is all about line drawing, and perhaps some (perhaps a very tiny<br/>minority), find that this sort of thing crosses it.<br/><br/>JMHO, of course<br/>Randy<br/>not a "real" letterboxer, but never short on pretentious answers<br/></div></div></div></blockquote></td></tr></table><br/>

you are not signed onto the site, or if you have no finds logged you <br/>
cannot see the clue.<br/>
<br/>
Do I like how he did this?  No.  I understand why, but I too don't think <br/>
number of finds logged online determines the metal of one's boxing <br/>
prowess, but I have written of this before.  In any case, he is wording <br/>
that VERY poorly, and in AQ's defense, it has nothing to do with this.<br/>

&gt; Ok, I'll play devil's advocate then, without actually looking at the<br/>

&gt; comments are intended to be abstract.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; How would one feel of a box with a restriction that only those of<br/>
&gt; San descent [choose your ethnicity here] were permitted or not<br/>
&gt; permitted to find it?  Suppose some web site were programmed to<br/>
&gt; enforce these ethnic restrictions?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Of course the creator can do what they want, and put such a restriction<br/>
&gt; on it.  Of course the creator can use a web site that enforces such<br/>
&gt; restrictions.  There are no rules.  But, would such be offensive? (note<br/>
&gt; there is a difference between "rules" and "social etiquette").<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I think it would be offensive to some people.  Would it be offensive<br/>
&gt; to a preponderance of the letterboxing population?  Would it be<br/>
&gt; "crossing a line"?  Who knows?  This is only a thought experiment.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; My opinion is that you "cross the line" when you place restrictions<br/>
&gt; outside the problem domain of the box or clue.  Requiring someone to<br/>
&gt; find 10 unrelated boxes, or be a member of some group or web site<br/>
&gt; is outside the problem domain of most boxes, and thus I find it<br/>
&gt; offensive.  Requiring people to find _that_ clue, or solve rock<br/>
&gt; trivia questions related to a particular clue, however, are inside<br/>
&gt; the problem domain of that and related boxes, and thus are not<br/>
&gt; offensive.  Solving the mystery of a mystery box is fine, being<br/>
&gt; San or joining some web site is not.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; It is all about line drawing, and perhaps some (perhaps a very tiny<br/>
&gt; minority), find that this sort of thing crosses it.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; JMHO, of course<br/>
&gt; Randy<br/>
&gt; not a "real" letterboxer, but never short on pretentious answers<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; ------------------------------------<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;   <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
</span></blockquote>The way I see it, can it be offensive?  Yes.  Do they have the right to <br/>
do what they want in order to restrict clues, sure, but, at the same <br/>
time, as a finder I have a choice.  If someone put some sort of ethnic <br/>
restriction on a box, as a finder I would simply choose to ignore the <br/>
box, or boxes, or all the boxes of that particular planter.  The same <br/>
can go for anything else involving a box, from if it is a long or short <br/>
hike, a mystery, a Mapsurfer box, I can make the choice to go find it or <br/>
not go find it.<br/>

just blunt.<br/>
<br/>
Of course, some folks would say I am being provocative simply by saying <br/>
who the placer is, but jeez, no sense in making things hard on folks, <br/>
and no sense in talking about folks behind their backs without at least <br/>
saying who they are.<br/>

<div>The thing about the AQ find restrictions, though, is that they 
        don't WORK.  You don't have to be a real letterboxer, heck you 
        don't even have to be a real PERSON, and you certainly don't have to 
        have found any letterboxes.  All you have to do is LOG a find (or 
        ten finds, or however many....)  It took me only a few minutes to 
        create a ficticious account &amp; log enough finds to access the clues.

  Date: Friday, February 20, 2009, 8:24 AM<br/>&gt; Miz Scarlet is right. There 
  are no rules, just get out<br/>&gt; there and box. Make em' hard, make em' 
  easy, make<br/>&gt; them unaccessible, make them for everyone, make people 
  hike,<br/>&gt; do a drive by, get em' at events, make them puzzles,<br/>&gt; 
  give straightforward directions. Post them, don't post<br/>&gt; them, record 
  them, don't record them, use AQ, don't<br/>&gt; use AQ, use LBNA, don't use 
  LBNA, put restrictions on<br/>&gt; them, don't put restrictions on them, use 
  people's<br/>&gt; personal webpages or not. Just Box.<br/>&gt; <br/>&gt; To each 
  his own, do what makes you happy. To me that<br/>&gt; qualifies you as a 
  letterboxer. Not how long you have been<br/>&gt; doing it or how many you have

  Miz Scarlet is right. There are no rules, just<br/>&gt; get out there and box.

  <br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Ok, I'll play devil's advocate then, 
  without<br/>&gt; actually looking at the<br/>&gt; &gt; clue in question or being 
  familiar with the<br/>&gt; individual. These<br/>&gt; &gt; comments are intended 
  to be abstract.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; How would one feel of a box with a 
  restriction that<br/>&gt; only those of<br/>&gt; &gt; San descent [choose your 
  ethnicity here] were<br/>&gt; permitted or not<br/>&gt; &gt; permitted to find 
  it? Suppose some web site were<br/>&gt; programmed to<br/>&gt; &gt; enforce 
  these ethnic restrictions?<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Of course the creator can 
  do what they want, and put<br/>&gt; such a restriction<br/>&gt; &gt; on it. Of 
  course the creator can use a web site that<br/>&gt; enforces such<br/>&gt; &gt; 
  restrictions. There are no rules. But, would such be<br/>&gt; offensive? 
  (note<br/>&gt; &gt; there is a difference between "rules" and<br/>&gt; "social 
  etiquette").<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; I think it would be offensive to some 
  people. Would<br/>&gt; it be offensive<br/>&gt; &gt; to a preponderance of the 
  letterboxing population? <br/>&gt; Would it be<br/>&gt; &gt; "crossing a line"? 
  Who knows? This is only<br/>&gt; a thought experiment.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; 
  &gt; My opinion is that you "cross the line" when<br/>&gt; you place 
  restrictions<br/>&gt; &gt; outside the problem domain of the box or clue. 
  <br/>&gt; Requiring someone to<br/>&gt; &gt; find 10 unrelated boxes, or be a 
  member of some group<br/>&gt; or web site<br/>&gt; &gt; is outside the problem 
  domain of most boxes, and thus<br/>&gt; I find it<br/>&gt; &gt; offensive. 
  Requiring people to find _that_ clue, or<br/>&gt; solve rock<br/>&gt; &gt; 
  trivia questions related to a particular clue,<br/>&gt; however, are 
  inside<br/>&gt; &gt; the problem domain of that and related boxes, and 
  thus<br/>&gt; are not<br/>&gt; &gt; offensive. Solving the mystery of a mystery 
  box is<br/>&gt; fine, being<br/>&gt; &gt; San or joining some web site is 
  not.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; It is all about line drawing, and perhaps 
  some<br/>&gt; (perhaps a very tiny<br/>&gt; &gt; minority), find that this sort 
  of thing crosses it.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; JMHO, of course<br/>&gt; &gt;

  ------------ --------- --------- ------<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; 
  <br/>&gt; <br/>&gt; <br/>&gt; The way I see it, can it be offensive? Yes. Do they 
  have<br/>&gt; the right to <br/>&gt; do what they want in order to restrict 
  clues, sure, but, at<br/>&gt; the same <br/>&gt; time, as a finder I have a 
  choice. If someone put some<br/>&gt; sort of ethnic <br/>&gt; restriction on a 
  box, as a finder I would simply choose to<br/>&gt; ignore the <br/>&gt; box, or 
  boxes, or all the boxes of that particular planter.<br/>&gt; The same <br/>&gt; 
  can go for anything else involving a box, from if it is a<br/>&gt; long or 
  short <br/>&gt; hike, a mystery, a Mapsurfer box, I can make the choice 
  to<br/>&gt; go find it or <br/>&gt; not go find it.<br/>&gt; <br/>&gt; -- <br/>&gt;

I'd like to make it clear that Ryan has been very clear from day one <br/>
that he didn't appreciate boxes being listed on LbNA that had AQ <br/>
restrictions. And for those who are unclear on this point, you do not <br/>
need to register at AQ in order to access clues. Anyone who visits the <br/>
website can get clues - you don't have to join - what registration <br/>
allows you to do is log finds and plants. By contrast, last time I <br/>
checked, you have to join LbMA in order to have access to the clues that <br/>
appear in the posts and files section.<br/>

<div>You don't need to be registered at AQ to access MOST of the clues.  But the clues in question have a find restriction of 1.  I cannot access those clues if I am not logged in under my AQ identity.  My alter ego cannot access those clues when logged in under "her" AQ identity UNTIL that identity logs first logs a find on another box.  "Anyone who visits the website" does not have access to THOSE clues unless they register, log at least one find and are logged in to the website.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>By contrast, you do not need to be registered at letterboxing.org to access ANY of the clues.  If you can't access something at letterboxing.org, it's because the planter has linked to another website that is restricting you.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>The restrictions work on AQ because unless you already meet the criteria, you are not aware that the box even exists.  It's not being flaunted in your face, "here's a box but you can't have the clues."  Pretty much the same with the LBMA boxes, if you are a member you have full access, if not you don't even know they are there.  The problems with the listings under discussion are a) they say "here's a clue but you can't get it if you don't meet the restrictions on this other website" and b) they imply that if you don't meet those restrictions, you're not a "real letterboxer." </div>
<div> </div>
<div>BTW there are other options to hide boxes from search engines, besides the plant &amp; find restrictions....</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Sheba</div>
<div> </div>
<div>PS. If I knew that there was, say, a 10-find restriction on a box, and I didn't have the requisite 10 finds....why would I email the planter to ask for the clues?  </div>

been watching it closely because I have been giving thought to how we <br/>
(the letterboxing community) might implement security features <br/>
without creating barriers to newcomers. With all due respect to my <br/>
friends here that detest AQ... I've considered putting AQ "F" <br/>
restrictions on future boxes... but leaving my existing active <br/>
inventory unrestricted... and I was going to encourage other area <br/>
boxers to do the same. Why? Well we want to have plenty of <br/>
unrestricted boxes for newcomers to gain experience with . . . but I <br/>
think it might be constructive if our community featured not only the <br/>
free, open, "at large" inventory but another more restricted <br/>
(exclusive?) inventory availlable to those persons whom after <br/>
some "apprentiship" (for lack of a better term!) have demonstrated <br/>
they adhere to the standard letterboxing practice (like rehiding and <br/>
using appropriate care) we all accept. This would limit muggle damage<br/>
by those persons who box for a day or two then lose interest. Also it <br/>
was not long ago there was an anti-letterboxing retired park service <br/>
person was actively engaged in destroying letterboxes with clues <br/>
posted on LBNA.<br/>

&gt; Hi Deb . . . this was an interesting discussion you<br/>
&gt; initiated. I've <br/>
&gt; been watching it closely because I have been giving thought<br/>
&gt; to how we <br/>
&gt; (the letterboxing community) might implement security<br/>
&gt; features <br/>
&gt; without creating barriers to newcomers. With all due<br/>
&gt; respect to my <br/>
&gt; friends here that detest AQ... I've considered putting<br/>
&gt; AQ "F" <br/>
&gt; restrictions on future boxes... but leaving my existing<br/>
&gt; active <br/>
&gt; inventory unrestricted... and I was going to encourage<br/>
&gt; other area <br/>
&gt; boxers to do the same. Why? Well we want to have plenty of <br/>
&gt; unrestricted boxes for newcomers to gain experience with .<br/>
&gt; . . but I <br/>
&gt; think it might be constructive if our community featured<br/>
&gt; not only the <br/>
&gt; free, open, "at large" inventory but another more<br/>
&gt; restricted <br/>
&gt; (exclusive?) inventory availlable to those persons whom<br/>
&gt; after <br/>
&gt; some "apprentiship" (for lack of a better term!)<br/>
&gt; have demonstrated <br/>
&gt; they adhere to the standard letterboxing practice (like<br/>
&gt; rehiding and <br/>
&gt; using appropriate care) we all accept. This would limit<br/>
&gt; muggle damage<br/>
&gt; by those persons who box for a day or two then lose<br/>
&gt; interest. Also it <br/>
&gt; was not long ago there was an anti-letterboxing retired<br/>
&gt; park service <br/>
&gt; person was actively engaged in destroying letterboxes with<br/>
&gt; clues <br/>
&gt; posted on LBNA.<br/>

&gt; &gt; Well, that was fun!  Now I have a REAL (alias)<br/>
&gt; letterboxer identity <br/>
&gt; on AQ!<br/>
&gt; &gt; I'll continue to merrily log a few finds (of<br/>
&gt; retired boxes so I <br/>
&gt; don't mess<br/>
&gt; &gt; with the heads of those who rely on "recent<br/>
&gt; finds").  I'll then get <br/>
&gt; a nice F<br/>
&gt; &gt; count to access more clues.  Maybe I'll also plant<br/>
&gt; a few "retired" <br/>
&gt; boxes<br/>
&gt; &gt; since I understand some restrictions are based on AQ P<br/>
&gt; counts.  <br/>
&gt; I've planted<br/>
&gt; &gt; over 100, but only have my few international boxes<br/>
&gt; posted on AQ.<br/>

&gt; &gt;       The thing about the AQ find restrictions,<br/>
&gt; though, is that <br/>
&gt; they don't<br/>
&gt; &gt; WORK.  You don't have to be a real letterboxer,<br/>
&gt; heck you don't even <br/>
&gt; have to<br/>
&gt; &gt; be a real PERSON, and you certainly don't have to<br/>
&gt; have found any<br/>
&gt; &gt; letterboxes.  All you have to do is LOG a find (or ten<br/>
&gt; finds, or <br/>
&gt; however<br/>
&gt; &gt; many....)  It took me only a few minutes to create a<br/>
&gt; ficticious <br/>
&gt; account &amp;<br/>
&gt; &gt; log enough finds to access the clues. So what's<br/>
&gt; the POINT????<br/>

so much to keep reporters and rangers away. It is a prejudice. I admit<br/>

2) With regard to logging finds, I have a software program that can<br/>
automatically fill in forms. Once set up (in a couple of minutes), I<br/>
could create thousands of finds. Don't need a cat.<br/>

3) I understand that in order to get hold of the Dartmoor catalog, you<br/>
need to have 100 finds registered. Can these be 100 US finds, or do<br/>
they need to be Dartmoor finds?<br/>

  <br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Ok, I'll play devil's advocate then, without actually looking 
  at the<br/>&gt; clue in question or being familiar with the individual. 
  These<br/>&gt; comments are intended to be abstract.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; How would 
  one feel of a box with a restriction that only those of<br/>&gt; San descent 
  [choose your ethnicity here] were permitted or not<br/>&gt; permitted to find 
  it? Suppose some web site were programmed to<br/>&gt; enforce these ethnic 
  restrictions?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Of course the creator can do what they want, and 
  put such a restriction<br/>&gt; on it. Of course the creator can use a web site 
  that enforces such<br/>&gt; restrictions. There are no rules. But, would such 
  be offensive? (note<br/>&gt; there is a difference between "rules" and "social 
  etiquette").<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I think it would be offensive to some people. 
  Would it be offensive<br/>&gt; to a preponderance of the letterboxing 
  population? Would it be<br/>&gt; "crossing a line"? Who knows? This is only a 
  thought experiment.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; My opinion is that you "cross the line" 
  when you place restrictions<br/>&gt; outside the problem domain of the box or 
  clue. Requiring someone to<br/>&gt; find 10 unrelated boxes, or be a member of 
  some group or web site<br/>&gt; is outside the problem domain of most boxes, 
  and thus I find it<br/>&gt; offensive. Requiring people to find _that_ clue, or 
  solve rock<br/>&gt; trivia questions related to a particular clue, however, are 
  inside<br/>&gt; the problem domain of that and related boxes, and thus are 
  not<br/>&gt; offensive. Solving the mystery of a mystery box is fine, 
  being<br/>&gt; San or joining some web site is not.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; It is all 
  about line drawing, and perhaps some (perhaps a very tiny<br/>&gt; minority), 
  find that this sort of thing crosses it.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; JMHO, of 
  course<br/>&gt; Randy<br/>&gt; not a "real" letterboxer, but never short on 
  pretentious answers<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; 
  ------------ --------- --------- ------<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; 
  <br/><br/>The way I see it, can it be offensive? Yes. Do they have the right to 
  <br/>do what they want in order to restrict clues, sure, but, at the same 
  <br/>time, as a finder I have a choice. If someone put some sort of ethnic 
  <br/>restriction on a box, as a finder I would simply choose to ignore the 
  <br/>box, or boxes, or all the boxes of that particular planter. The same 
  <br/>can go for anything else involving a box, from if it is a long or short 
  <br/>hike, a mystery, a Mapsurfer box, I can make the choice to go find it or 
  <br/>not go find it.<br/><br/>-- <br/>Nathan Brown<br/><br/>AKA

&gt; &gt; &gt; I agree, The AQ find count alone means nothing. What does mean <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; soemthing is one's reputation. The reputation one earns by <br/>
&gt; finding, <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; planting and being a positive (or at least nuetral) participant in <br/>
&gt; the <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; community. Kirbert, the Forida letterboxer who drew the ire of <br/>
&gt; some <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; here because posted the AQ F restriction on LBNA did notice that <br/>
&gt; last <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; Friday someone created a new AQ identity and logged finds on a <br/>
&gt; dozen of <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; his boxes in one day. The boxes were no no longer active and most <br/>
&gt; were <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; not even there now. See the discussion about this "mystery" over <br/>
&gt; on <br/>

    <br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Ok, I'll play devil's advocate then, without actually 
    looking at the<br/>&gt; clue in question or being familiar with the 
    individual. These<br/>&gt; comments are intended to be 
    abstract.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; How would one feel of a box with a restriction 
    that only those of<br/>&gt; San descent [choose your ethnicity here] were 
    permitted or not<br/>&gt; permitted to find it? Suppose some web site were 
    programmed to<br/>&gt; enforce these ethnic restrictions?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Of 
    course the creator can do what they want, and put such a restriction<br/>&gt; 
    on it. Of course the creator can use a web site that enforces such<br/>&gt; 
    restrictions. There are no rules. But, would such be offensive? 
    (note<br/>&gt; there is a difference between "rules" and "social 
    etiquette").<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I think it would be offensive to some people. 
    Would it be offensive<br/>&gt; to a preponderance of the letterboxing 
    population? Would it be<br/>&gt; "crossing a line"? Who knows? This is only a 
    thought experiment.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; My opinion is that you "cross the line" 
    when you place restrictions<br/>&gt; outside the problem domain of the box or 
    clue. Requiring someone to<br/>&gt; find 10 unrelated boxes, or be a member 
    of some group or web site<br/>&gt; is outside the problem domain of most 
    boxes, and thus I find it<br/>&gt; offensive. Requiring people to find _that_ 
    clue, or solve rock<br/>&gt; trivia questions related to a particular clue, 
    however, are inside<br/>&gt; the problem domain of that and related boxes, 
    and thus are not<br/>&gt; offensive. Solving the mystery of a mystery box is 
    fine, being<br/>&gt; San or joining some web site is not.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; It 
    is all about line drawing, and perhaps some (perhaps a very tiny<br/>&gt; 
    minority), find that this sort of thing crosses it.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; JMHO, of 
    course<br/>&gt; Randy<br/>&gt; not a "real" letterboxer, but never short on 
    pretentious answers<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; 
    ------------ --------- --------- ------<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; 
    <br/><br/>The way I see it, can it be offensive? Yes. Do they have the right 
    to <br/>do what they want in order to restrict clues, sure, but, at the same 
    <br/>time, as a finder I have a choice. If someone put some sort of ethnic 
    <br/>restriction on a box, as a finder I would simply choose to ignore the 
    <br/>box, or boxes, or all the boxes of that particular planter. The same 
    <br/>can go for anything else involving a box, from if it is a long or short 
    <br/>hike, a mystery, a Mapsurfer box, I can make the choice to go find it or 
    <br/>not go find it.<br/><br/>-- <br/>Nathan Brown<br/><br/>AKA

<div>No, there isn't.  However, AQ isn't the easiest to site to navigate and if you don't have the info that you need a logged find, much less how many finds to hit the requirement to 'unlock' a new clue showing a listing in the area, then on the surface, it would appear that if the Ranger tried running a simple search on the area, say 7 came up that showed other areas of the city, but not of the 5 boxes that are actually in the park, each with a F1 restriction on it.   By keeping the F count low, it would still allow newer boxers to have access to the clues, but someone that doesn't have that F count restriction would never have seen the listing at all.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>This, of course, is blown wide open when list the restricted box at LBNA, linking it to your clues on AQ.</div>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;<br/>

<br/>
</span></blockquote>OK, first off let me introduce myself.  I'm the placer of the boxes in<br/>
question, and the one who ended up curious about a whole bunch of<br/>
obviously fictitious finds on my retired boxes.  And yes, I have read<br/>
this entire thread.<br/>
<br/>
It's amazing how some people can take offense at that which was never<br/>
meant to offend.  Life's too short to get all that upset about things<br/>
that WERE meant to offend, let alone innocuous comments.  And while I<br/>
meant no disrespect to non-AQ letterboxers, I could point out that<br/>
there were things said here about AQ letterboxers that most certainly<br/>
WERE meant to offend.<br/>
<br/>
As a general rule, I try to make my clues available to users of either<br/>
AQ or LbNA; I'd like all the finders I can get!  I generally post the<br/>
clues on AQ simply because I find it a better and more comprehensive<br/>
medium, then I just put a link at LbNA pointing to it.<br/>
<br/>
I also tend to prefer to "fly under the radar" when it comes to box<br/>
planting.  What I mean is, when there's a choice between tracking down<br/>
the park managers and asking them whether I can plant a box in their<br/>
park and filling out whatever paperwork in triplicate is involved or<br/>
just planting and not telling them, I nearly always follow the latter<br/>
plan.  I have a "what they don't know won't hurt them" attitude<br/>
towards letterbox placement.<br/>
<br/>
Of course, what they don't know won't hurt them as long as they don't<br/>
know!  Some of these managers check box listings on AQ or LbNA to see<br/>
if anything is listed in their park, and if so they go grab it and<br/>
throw it away or contact the planter and spew venom or whatnot.  To<br/>
avoid such strife, I've found that AQ's find count requirement does a<br/>
decent job keeping these land managers from getting wind of the clues.<br/>
 AQ won't claim that was the intent, but it certainly works for that<br/>
purpose.<br/>
<br/>
AQ recommends that, if a box is given a find count (or a plant count,<br/>
which is obviously even more restrictive) that we refrain from<br/>
cross-linking from LbNA.  The webmaster gets miffed when people find<br/>
the listing on LbNA, click on it, and get what appears to be a dead<br/>
link -- and then contact him about what's up.<br/>
<br/>
So, I've been somewhat ignoring his advice and cross-linking from LbNA<br/>
anyway.  But instead of automatically linking to the AQ listing --<br/>
which will fail if you don't meet the find count requirements -- it<br/>
opens a text in LbNA first.  To begin with, I just stated that this<br/>
box has a find count requirement, you must log some finds on AQ before<br/>
you can see the clue.<br/>
<br/>
Then it occurred to me that I was telling the park managers exactly<br/>
what they needed to do to see my clues!  A bit too obvious, methinks.<br/>
 So I started writing that line about AQ checking "to see if you are a<br/>
real letterboxer" instead.  I thought it was funny; the idea of a<br/>
noxer clicking on the link and getting a dead end and wondering how AQ<br/>
knew he wasn't a real letterboxer made me giggle.  It seemed to me<br/>
that it'd be only too obvious to any actual letterboxer that there was<br/>
a restriction that must be met -- especially anyone familiar enough<br/>
with AQ to know the find count restrictions exist.<br/>
<br/>
Do I think that non-AQ letterboxers aren't real letterboxers?  If I<br/>
did, would I go through such efforts to try to make my clues available<br/>
to them?  Remember, the other option was no listing on LbNA at all --<br/>
which, apparently, is a recommendation I should have heeded.<br/>
<br/>
I hope I have been civil, as promised.  I'll remain a member of this<br/>
group for a few days for follow-up discussion, but then I'll drop<br/>
membership as I don't actually live in the region!<br/>

&gt;<br/>
&gt; So, I've been somewhat ignoring his advice and cross-linking from LbNA<br/>
&gt; anyway. But instead of automatically linking to the AQ listing --<br/>
&gt; which will fail if you don't meet the find count requirements -- it<br/>
&gt; opens a text in LbNA first. To begin with, I just stated that this<br/>
&gt; box has a find count requirement, you must log some finds on AQ before<br/>
&gt; you can see the clue.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Then it occurred to me that I was telling the park managers exactly<br/>
&gt; what they needed to do to see my clues! A bit too obvious, methinks.<br/>
&gt; So I started writing that line about AQ checking "to see if you are a<br/>
&gt; real letterboxer" instead. I thought it was funny; the idea of a<br/>
&gt; noxer clicking on the link and getting a dead end and wondering how AQ<br/>
&gt; knew he wasn't a real letterboxer made me giggle. It seemed to me<br/>
&gt; that it'd be only too obvious to any actual letterboxer that there was<br/>
&gt; a restriction that must be met -- especially anyone familiar enough<br/>
&gt; with AQ to know the find count restrictions exist.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Do I think that non-AQ letterboxers aren't real letterboxers? If I<br/>
&gt; did, would I go through such efforts to try to make my clues available<br/>
&gt; to them? Remember, the other option was no listing on LbNA at all --<br/>
&gt; which, apparently, is a recommendation I should have heeded.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I hope I have been civil, as promised. I'll remain a member of this<br/>
&gt; group for a few days for follow-up discussion, but then I'll drop<br/>
&gt; membership as I don't actually live in the region!<br/>

Suzanne Coe &lt;wilmcoe@... &gt; wrote:<br/><blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;<br/>&gt; So what's the 
 </span></blockquote>POINT????<br/><br/>OK, first off let me introduce myself. I'm the placer of the 
boxes in<br/>question, and the one who ended up curious about a whole bunch 
of<br/>obviously fictitious finds on my retired boxes. And yes, I have 
read<br/>this entire thread.<br/><br/>It's amazing how some people can take offense 
at that which was never<br/>meant to offend. Life's too short to get all that 
upset about things<br/>that WERE meant to offend, let alone innocuous comments. 
And while I<br/>meant no disrespect to non-AQ letterboxers, I could point out 
that<br/>there were things said here about AQ letterboxers that most 
certainly<br/>WERE meant to offend.<br/><br/>As a general rule, I try to make my 
clues available to users of either<br/>AQ or LbNA; I'd like all the finders I can 
get! I generally post the<br/>clues on AQ simply because I find it a better and 
more comprehensive<br/>medium, then I just put a link at LbNA pointing to 
it.<br/><br/>I also tend to prefer to "fly under the radar" when it comes to 
box<br/>planting. What I mean is, when there's a choice between tracking 
down<br/>the park managers and asking them whether I can plant a box in 
their<br/>park and filling out whatever paperwork in triplicate is involved 
or<br/>just planting and not telling them, I nearly always follow the 
latter<br/>plan. I have a "what they don't know won't hurt them" 
attitude<br/>towards letterbox placement.<br/><br/>Of course, what they don't know 
won't hurt them as long as they don't<br/>know! Some of these managers check box 
listings on AQ or LbNA to see<br/>if anything is listed in their park, and if so 
they go grab it and<br/>throw it away or contact the planter and spew venom or 
whatnot. To<br/>avoid such strife, I've found that AQ's find count requirement 
does a<br/>decent job keeping these land managers from getting wind of the 
clues.<br/>AQ won't claim that was the intent, but it certainly works for 
that<br/>purpose.<br/><br/>AQ recommends that, if a box is given a find count (or a 
plant count,<br/>which is obviously even more restrictive) that we refrain 
from<br/>cross-linking from LbNA. The webmaster gets miffed when people 
find<br/>the listing on LbNA, click on it, and get what appears to be a 
dead<br/>link -- and then contact him about what's up.<br/><br/>So, I've been 
somewhat ignoring his advice and cross-linking from LbNA<br/>anyway. But instead 
of automatically linking to the AQ listing --<br/>which will fail if you don't 
meet the find count requirements -- it<br/>opens a text in LbNA first. To begin 
with, I just stated that this<br/>box has a find count requirement, you must log 
some finds on AQ before<br/>you can see the clue.<br/><br/>Then it occurred to me

&gt; comments.<br/>
<br/>
</span></blockquote>Ah C'mon.  Do you really want one of my pretentious dissertations?<br/>
<br/>
I've already stated how I find out-of-band restrictions inappropriate,<br/>
and Kirbert claims to have read the thread; and nothing in his response<br/>
changes my opinion on that score, so what would be the sense of<br/>
repeating it?<br/>
<br/>
I would say, for someone who's ideology seems to have tenets<br/>
related to private property rights, that I am a bit mystified at<br/>
the lack of respect for Ryan's property rights as to how he wishes<br/>
his site used (specifically "So, I've been somewhat ignoring his<br/>
advice and cross-linking from LbNA"), but that seems tangential and <br/>
off-topic at best, and bordering on petty (certainly Ryan can<br/>
enforce his property rights if he wants to).  (And, of course,<br/>
if it is only truly "advice", it is not even anything).  FWIW,<br/>
I liken it to someone asking you to take your shoes off before<br/>
coming into their home.<br/>
<br/>
The substantiative point to discuss (since most of the others have<br/>
already been discussed, and I still stand by what I have said<br/>
previously), would of course be this notion of using the AQ F<br/>
feature to hide boxes from park managers, newbies, noxers, and<br/>
any number of other perceived people we don't want on clues.  I<br/>
tend to feel ideologically that that is a bad idea; I would<br/>
think it was cool if someone's first exposure to the hobby were via<br/>
my clues.  I also give people credit for being able to figure this<br/>
out, and, in economics, it is a classic arms race problem (e.g.,<br/>
the next step is to put F 50 billion on it and require captcha<br/>
entry, etc., all of which gets even more annoying for legit<br/>
users, and so the scripts that need to be written take a couple<br/>
minutes longer to run and are harder to write, and so on -- the<br/>
best solution to an arms race is to not start one).  This is<br/>
not rocket science, even I can figure it out.<br/>
<br/>
In the long run, I think this sort of approach makes it harder for<br/>
legitimate boxers, and is a bad economic bet.  If you have 100<br/>
boxers looking for the clue, and each must incur this increased<br/>
cost of registering on AQ and writing a script to jack their F count,<br/>
and remembering that a noxer can do the same, thereby perhaps only<br/>
reducing the probability of the box being muggled by some fraction,<br/>
not eliminating the possibility, has the community made a profit?<br/>
Who knows?  You have to run actual numbers and probabilities if<br/>
you care enough (and I certainly don't; I'm willing to take it on<br/>
instinct).  Everyone (100 people) may end up paying a penny (in<br/>
hassle cost) to  save an overall 50 cents (reduced muggle<br/>
probability at cost) (metaphorically, of course).  Users of<br/>
AQ won't see it this way (their cost remains 0), but non-users<br/>
will.  So, it is an AQ centric solution, as has already been<br/>
mentioned.  Absolutely no value has been added (at least by me).<br/>
<br/>
And yeah, putting something on website A that users of website<br/>
A can't use also seems like a bad idea, but that has been discussed<br/>
quite a bit also.<br/>
<br/>
(Well, of course it ended up being pretentious.  We wouldn't<br/>
expect anything less, would we :))</div>

      make them unaccessible, make them for <br/>&gt;&gt; everyone,<br/>&gt;&gt; 
      <br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Ok, I'll play devil's advocate then, without actually 
      looking at the<br/>&gt; clue in question or being familiar with the 
      individual. These<br/>&gt; comments are intended to be 
      abstract.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; How would one feel of a box with a restriction 
      that only those of<br/>&gt; San descent [choose your ethnicity here] were 
      permitted or not<br/>&gt; permitted to find it? Suppose some web site were 
      programmed to<br/>&gt; enforce these ethnic restrictions?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; 
      Of course the creator can do what they want, and put such a 
      restriction<br/>&gt; on it. Of course the creator can use a web site that 
      enforces such<br/>&gt; restrictions. There are no rules. But, would such be 
      offensive? (note<br/>&gt; there is a difference between "rules" and "social 
      etiquette").<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I think it would be offensive to some people. 
      Would it be offensive<br/>&gt; to a preponderance of the letterboxing 
      population? Would it be<br/>&gt; "crossing a line"? Who knows? This is only 
      a thought experiment.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; My opinion is that you "cross the 
      line" when you place restrictions<br/>&gt; outside the problem domain of 
      the box or clue. Requiring someone to<br/>&gt; find 10 unrelated boxes, or 
      be a member of some group or web site<br/>&gt; is outside the problem 
      domain of most boxes, and thus I find it<br/>&gt; offensive. Requiring 
      people to find _that_ clue, or solve rock<br/>&gt; trivia questions related 
      to a particular clue, however, are inside<br/>&gt; the problem domain of 
      that and related boxes, and thus are not<br/>&gt; offensive. Solving the 
      mystery of a mystery box is fine, being<br/>&gt; San or joining some web 
      site is not.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; It is all about line drawing, and perhaps 
      some (perhaps a very tiny<br/>&gt; minority), find that this sort of thing 
      crosses it.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; JMHO, of course<br/>&gt; Randy<br/>&gt; not a 
      "real" letterboxer, but never short on pretentious

      <br/><br/>The way I see it, can it be offensive? Yes. Do they have the right 
      to <br/>do what they want in order to restrict clues, sure, but, at the 
      same <br/>time, as a finder I have a choice. If someone put some sort of 
      ethnic <br/>restriction on a box, as a finder I would simply choose to 
      ignore the <br/>box, or boxes, or all the boxes of that particular planter. 
      The same <br/>can go for anything else involving a box, from if it is a 
      long or short <br/>hike, a mystery, a Mapsurfer box, I can make the choice 
      to go find it or <br/>not go find it.<br/><br/>-- <br/>Nathan Brown<br/><br/>AKA

effort - or maybe even just contacting the planter. I can't see that <br/>
it's any different, in principle, from making people solve a puzzle or <br/>
interpret mystery clues in order to get the clues to a box, or advising <br/>
them to keep their eyes open and dig around on the boards, or having <br/>
clues posted on your own site of which only the cognoscenti are aware. <br/>
Yes, some can and will sneer at F-restrictions as being a substitute for <br/>
making the effort to make your clues more inaccessible through <br/>
brainpower, but, again in principle, it's simply an attempt to limit <br/>
access to clues based on whatever reason the planter chooses. Heck, for <br/>
some of my clues, you have to meet an F-restriction and then solve a puzzle!<br/>
<br/>
But ultimately it is up to each boxer to decide what hoops they are or <br/>
are not willing to jump through in order to access a clue. If you don't <br/>
want to register at AQ in order to get the clue to a box, fine, don't. <br/>
Or if you want to make some kind of a point by registering and recording <br/>
fake finds, fine, do that if it's what floats your boat.<br/>

Hmm. Must consider further.<br/>

them any more.  I went ahead and pulled some that had other types of<br/>
restrictions, such as those that you need to be enabled for "punups"<br/>
on AQ to view.  For some reason, I feel far less concerned about<br/>
LbNA-only letterboxers knowing about my boxes than I used to.  I can<br/>
see the argument that has been discussed on the AQ forums a few times<br/>
that, if you choose not to be authorized to see clues for whatever<br/>
reason, you'll be happier if you have no idea the box exists at all. <br/>
So, now, LbNA-only users will have no idea my restricted boxes exist,<br/>
so they won't get all upset about them any more.</div>

</span></blockquote>Yes, and one of those posts was mine. My understanding is that his only <br/>
objection is when he gets complaints from non-AQ users who aren't able <br/>
to access clues listed on other sites and blame him rather than the <br/>
planter. When I did have my F-restricted clues listed on LbNA I made a <br/>
point of having an explanation that directed folks to contact me with <br/>
any questions or concerns rather than bothering Ryan.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Well, you have to draw the line somewhere as to what you find<br/>
&gt; interesting, annoying, offensive, whatever <br/>
<br/>
</span></blockquote>As I pointed out in my post, it's up to each individual to decide for <br/>
him/herself what they are willing to do to get a clue. As to the <br/>
aesthetics of various ways to limit access to clues - well, it seems <br/>
like a long-winded way to make the point I already conceded; to wit, <br/>
that some folks will view F-restrictions as a less desirable or worthy <br/>
alternative for accomplishing that purpose.<br/>
<br/>
As far as I can see, all that has been accomplished here is that some <br/>
clues that were listed on LbNA - however restricted  - have been pulled, <br/>
and that therefore some people who might have not have had philosophical <br/>
problems with AQ or F-restrictions, and who might therefore have chosen <br/>
to access the clues and enjoy finding the boxes, no longer have that <br/>
opportunity.<br/>

LbNA.  That was part of the reason I went ahead and deleted them; <br/>
they were causing consternation rather than being the outreach that I <br/>
had intended.<br/>
<br/>
Really, the only difference made is that people cannot log their <br/>
finds on LbNA since these boxes are not listed there.  I've decided <br/>
that's not really a significant downside since LbNA is useless for <br/>
keeping track of find/plant/exchange counts anyway; if you want a web <br/>
site to keep a reasonably accurate tally for you, it's gotta be AQ.<br/>

because I don't want my words misinterpreted as the written word often is on 
these lists. People read stuff, put their own meaning into it and they are off. 
I'd rather just shut up most of the time now. I guess not this time though.

<div>Amen, and welcome brother Kirbert!!  I have always been surprised at 
  how so many postings among this group snub AQ, as if it is beneath them. 
   The few times I have brought it up, all you can hear is the crickets

   Respect the planter and rehide well.  Those are the only rules that 
  I know of.</div>

<div>I disagree...listening to the comments and "discussions" that I have 
been witness to for the past year &amp; being a new member here (&amp; I will 
think of myself as an outsider on this list). I have met some of you &amp; I 
have learned there are 2 things to avoid conversations about with you 
ALL...AQ &amp;  another boxer. I have found  many "comments" here to 
be offensive &amp; not needed. Yet, I stick around because you are in my back 
yard &amp; I will run into some of you at Gathers. Those of you that I have had 
the pleasure of meeting are always quite pleasant, but like I said, I know there 
are certain things NOT to talk about...I try to quietly leave when those 
discussions are going on...because once again I dont feel the need for the 
bashing...just dont need to hear the negatives in something I do 
that gives me pleasure. Will anyone ever look to me for  advice in 
this hobby...doubt it &amp; that is OK. I can give them the basics &amp; what I 
dont know about, I am not afraid to tell them they are better off 
asking someone more experienced &amp; I will suggest a name....usually someone 
from this board.  Some have hinted there are things about LBNA that are not 
liked, but no specifics have been discussed in front of me and I NEVER 
see this site being bashed on AQ as AQ is bashed here. Many boxers like the 
bells &amp; whistles on AQ. I look at AQ as a "Community" not a "Letterboxing 
Community". whether that is/was Ryan's intention...I dont know &amp; frankly 
doesnt matter to me...I know AQ has many things to offer me that make ME 
happy.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Now as far as Kirbert's boxes &amp; this whole discussion...Maybe he 
shouldn't have listed them here with a restriction on them. I honestly dont 
think it was to offend.  And if you want to seek them that 
badly...email the planter or log a find &amp; plant. Real find or plant? Up to 
you...you have to live with your actions, not me, not the planter, not the 
participants on this board. It has now been handled..the boxes have been pulled 
from the list. What this the right thing to do? Who knows? PLANTERS choice. 
</div>
<div>We are always told there really are no rules to this game except the ones 
MissMoon &amp; DC Stones has kindly reminded us of. If planters chose 
not to abide, then they take the risk of few finders *shrugging shoulders*. Who 
cares? It is up to the planter. I had a long time boxer from this 
board email me to tell they would not look for one of my boxes because they did 
not like the way I wrote the clue. No skin off my teeth...it is MY box...others 
WILL seek it out. Their loss of the beautiful spot during leaf peeping season. 
</div>
<div>I have a couple of boxes listed here. But not all of mine. (I am not a big 
planter anyway).  My reasons are MY reasons. And are good ones... at 
least in my sheltered little planters mind...LOL.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Ok...enough...going back to "lurking" for many months again.</div>

<div><font face="Arial" size="2">I don't think anyone here thinks AQ is beneath 
  them or snubs AQ. And that's not the impression I get from the discussions 
  that go on here. Most of us are members and use it to varying degrees. I think 
  many of us may feel that it has lost direction and has too many unecessary 
  bells and whistles and sometimes seems to try and dictate the "rules" of 
  boxing, of which there should be none other than the basics of respecting 
  property, be responsible, leave no trace, respect people, all those kinds of 
  basics adults are supposed to be able to do. There are new boxers who seem to 
  think the owner of the site is the "leader" of boxing. </font></div>
<div><font face="Arial" size="2"></font> </div>
<div><font face="Arial" size="2">It seems to me there have been plenty of 
  well thought out responses to Kirbert's posts. It doesn't look quiet to me. 
  </font></div>
<div><font face="Arial" size="2"></font> </div>
<div><font face="Arial" size="2">One reason some discussions may not get started 
  or may not go very far is because the people who have been posting here for 
  years have always tried to keep things as civil as possible and not descend to 
  the level of the stupid crap that passes for discussions on the big list 
  sometimes. I think many of us think of each other as friends and not just 
  names on a monitor that we will never meet and are willing to say anything to 
  on a keyboard. I'd much rather have people hold their tongues (and lord knows 
  I have been guilty of the opposite more than once) than get into some of the 
  crap I see on other boards and lists.  I know I hold my tongue a lot 
  these days because I don't want my words misinterpreted as the written word 
  often is on these lists. People read stuff, put their own meaning into it and 
  they are off. I'd rather just shut up most of the time now. I guess not this 
  time though. </font></div>

<div>Amen, and welcome brother Kirbert!!  I have always been surprised

     The few times I have brought it up, all you can hear is the crickets

     Respect the planter and rehide well.  Those are the only rules

<div><font face="Arial" size="2">Welllllll, you're entitled to your opinion about 
the whole AQ and how some of us feel, act and talk about it. I'm not going to 
argue about it. I maaaaaaay even agree that some of the things you said might 
well be true of a few people but I really don't think it's true of the majority 
of us. </font></div>
<div><font face="Arial" size="2"></font> </div>
<div><font face="Arial" size="2">That being said, I do think that if someone felt 
compelled to tell you they wouldn't do your boxes simply because they didn't 
like the way you "wrote the clue", and there was no legitimate problem with the 
clues.........even then there is a way to say things diplomatically if the 
person really feels the clues are bad...........if it was just a case of their 
pure dislike for some reason, I think that was rude and arrogant. Even if I felt 
that way, I wouldn't say it to someone. It's just uncalled for. Sometimes it's 
just better to keep your opinions to yourself, don't do the freaking boxes and 
move on. Some people just think they are the wheat and the rest of us are the 
chaff. What goes around comes around. </font></div>

log on for something like a year, the comments will become available <br/>

</span></blockquote>Fair enough.  It was discussed ad nauseum when the policy was <br/>
established, but the concensus was that abandoned letterboxes <br/>
constitute litter.  It's not difficult to log in once a year if you <br/>
never want comments to become available, but if you're actually gone <br/>
the "leave no trace" mantra directs that your box should either be <br/>
pulled or maintained by others.  And since others are not allowed to <br/>
adjust your clues -- at all -- the only way they can perform <br/>
maintenance when the clues need adjustment is by posting comments.<br/>

&gt;   <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
</span></blockquote>Is that what planting a box is all about?  So you can get the pat on the <br/>
back when someone finds it?<br/>
<br/>
Personally, I don't need thanks for planting a box.  I enjoy actually <br/>
looking a the logbooks, and don't need a long online dissertation about <br/>
what a fantastic plant it was.<br/>
<br/>
I log my finds, but more or less just to keep track of what I have and <br/>
have not found.  I usually only comment if there is a problem with the <br/>
box (note, a problem with the box is different then a problem with the <br/>
clues, I found the box, right?), so I rarely comment.  I often don't log <br/>
boxes in a timely manner, nor do I always use the correct date because <br/>
it doesn't matter to me.  And someone could go on today and log finds on <br/>
all of my boxes at once and I would not care.  I think it is a silly <br/>
thing to care whether someone has actually found the box or not, that is <br/>
on them.<br/>
<br/>
As for F-count restrictions, I really don't have a problem with them.  <br/>
But your using them just to keep boxes from prying eyes is uncreative.  <br/>
There are plenty of other ways to do that, photo clues, puzzles, codes, <br/>
any number of things.  A complete box, to me, not only has a great <br/>
location and presentation, but also a great clue, and clues matter.<br/>

often of history, and a fondness for challenges and puzzles - when I <br/>
have had to describe the typical letterboxer or to defend the hobby, <br/>
these are the qualities that I usually mention.<br/>
<br/>
Syner and I have not put an F-count restriction on our plants, and <br/>
I'm not too worried about that stuff.<br/>
<br/>
The conversation gets me thinking about the various park rangers and <br/>
superintendents, land managers, etc who may lurk on this or any <br/>
other board.<br/>
<br/>
I can imagine about ten different ways to get letterboxers in search <br/>
of a box without making its location apparent to non-boxers, <br/>
including park staff, using the common qualities and consequent <br/>
abilities named in my first paragraph.<br/>
<br/>
However, I have been able to sell the idea of a letterbox to some <br/>
unlikely locations based, in part, on the anticipated increase in <br/>
benevolent traffic.<br/>
<br/>
DE state parks expect a budget cut for '09 - no surprise - but a <br/>
park demonstrates its value to the state in terms of visitors - <br/>
popularity can save a park when resources are limited.  Right now, <br/>
the traffic associated with our hobby probably outweighs any <br/>
perceived threat to cultural or natural resources.<br/>
<br/>
Yes, I wander, but I am not yet lost, I hope.  My point, if such is <br/>
to be identified, is that a letterboxer is a person who letterboxes, <br/>
don't fear "the man," and take advantage of this current social <br/>
situation to go forth and find and plant boxes.  Spring is coming <br/>
and it will be GREAT!<br/>

your point. =) You did prove someone can create an account and log<br/>
fake finds--that was never in doubt--but would an "unreal" letterboxer<br/>
have actually gone to the effort?<br/>
<br/>
I do suggest that people who restrict their boxes to avoid linking to<br/>
them from any website (most notably LbNA) since it just tends to cause<br/>
problems and resentments. It's not a "rule" on Atlas Quest, mostly<br/>
just because I don't want to have to enforce it. <br/>
<br/>
Boxes with no restrictions--which amounts to about 95% of the listings<br/>
on AQ--I don't care one way or another. <br/>
<br/>
As for hiding listings from park authorities--I'd just as soon not<br/>
have any box listed on Atlas Quest that's not allowed by the<br/>
authorities. I know I can't stop people from hiding boxes where they<br/>
don't belong, but I'd just as soon those boxes not be listed on Atlas<br/>
Quest. I do delete them as I find them, but I don't actively hunt them<br/>
out either. I suspect the boxes Kirbert has listed don't have official<br/>
permission from the authorities, but that's not exactly the same as<br/>
the boxes not being allowed either.<br/>

<br/>
</span></blockquote>I know Kirbert's already mentioned it, but just to reinforce it, all<br/>
of those are things are choices you can opt out of. It might not be<br/>
easy to keep track of all the changes and options on Atlas Quest, but<br/>
I do make a point to make sure you can opt out of anything that would<br/>
allow someone to "alter" your listing.<br/>
<br/>
Admittedly, that has not always been the case. When I originally<br/>
implemented some of those things, I didn't think it was a big deal so<br/>
I didn't provide an option to opt out. But nowadays, I try very hard<br/>
to insure that nothing can be added to a box's listing that the owner<br/>
themselves did not include or allow someone else to include. If I've<br/>
overlooked something, please let me know.<br/>
<br/>
The one exception is if you abandoned your listings on Atlas Quest. I<br/>
don't want the site cluttered up with missing boxes and out-of-date<br/>
clues. If someone chooses not to list their box for that<br/>
reason--that's fine and good. If you're the kind of person who's<br/>
inclined to abandon your listings, I'd just as soon they not be listed<br/>
on AQ anyhow. Everyone's happy. =) <br/>
<br/>
On a related note, does LbNA even have a policy about listings that<br/>
appear to be abandoned? I know I've adopted boxes there with nothing<br/>
more than an e-mail sent a webmaster, so I'm not actually sure that<br/>
LbNA has a less intrusive solution than the one AQ uses. (Though<br/>
admittedly, that might be a reason why someone won't use either LbNA<br/>
or AQ.) But--I do readily tell anyone exactly what counts as an<br/>
abandoned listing and what happens to one's boxes if they are deemed<br/>
abandoned. If matters come to that, at least it shouldn't come as a<br/>
surprise.<br/>
<br/>
I'd love to provide a solution that would make everyone happy, but I<br/>
haven't thought of any and nobody has ever suggested one.<br/>

&gt; Interesting.  I'd like to know the definition of "previously <br/>
&gt; established" in this context.  Am I to presume that the purists here <br/>
&gt; consider anything on LbNA to be previously established and anything <br/>

</span></blockquote>So they don't like that feature on LbNA either?  Can you opt out of <br/>
it on LbNA?  Because you can opt out on AQ.  Actually, I'm not sure <br/>
you can prevent finders from logging finds, but you can prevent <br/>
anybody from seeing those logs.<br/>
