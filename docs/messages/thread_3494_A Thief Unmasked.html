<div>On April Fool's Day in the true first year of this millenium, a couple of meddling kids were playing in the woods not far from their apartment building (and the local police station) when they stumbled across a sealed PVC pipe in a cement drainage pipe.  Further searching by the authorities uncovered much, much more, ultimately inspiring at least two letterboxes.</div>

<div>This particular letterbox is in the woods not far from the police station, though not in precisely the same area as the original cache.</div>
