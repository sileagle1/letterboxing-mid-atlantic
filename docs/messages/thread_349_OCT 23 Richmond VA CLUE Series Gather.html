                    <div id="ygrps-yiv-575895060">Finally, I have pulled together all the LBMA posts and my emails <br/>
regarding an OCT 23 Richmond CLUE Series Gather.<br/>
<br/>
Before I start, if you are planning to attend please email me OFFLIST <br/>
(sowbiz @ yahoo . com).  I will reply with my cell no. in case you <br/>
have any last minute delays you can call me. Bring your own set of <br/>
clues and be sure you know how to get to Poor Farm Park (see below). <br/>
If you are planning to join up at any of the other parks along the <br/>
way (see agenda below) let me know which one.<br/>
<br/>
The series involves 3 parks in the LB.org clues PLUS a 4th park which <br/>
is determined from the clues collected in each of the 24 boxes at the <br/>
3 parks.  Based on estimated find, driving and lunch times, and with <br/>
Dorey the last park because it is nearest the 4th mystery park this <br/>
is the AGENDA:<br/>
<br/>
ARRIVE NLT 9AM Poor Farm Park  - Picnic Shelter #3<br/>
<br/>
9-noon    3.0hr ** Rooms ** Poor Farm Park <br/>
         +1.0hr LUNCH (bring your own)&amp; Exchanges<br/>
         +0.5hr DRIVE TO:<br/>
1:30-3P   1.5hr ** Suspects ** Powhite Park <br/>
         +0.5hr DRIVE TO:<br/>
3:30-5:15 1.8hr ** Weapons ** Dorey Park <br/>
         +0.2hr DRIVE TO:<br/>
5:30-6:30 1 hr ** Conclusion ** mystery park<br/>
<br/>
9.5 HRS TOTAL ESTIMATED TIME NEEDED <br/>
9.5 HRS Daylight 9AM  6:30PM<br/>
<br/>
This is really cutting it close.  So we don't want to waste any<br/>
time.<br/>
<br/>
A single sequence of parks will be followed.  I suggest you have your <br/>
personal stamp applied to `Avery' labels so we do not waste<br/>
time <br/>
logging in and can keep to the agenda time frame.  At the first park <br/>
we will decide whether to carpool to the other parks.  Allow 1/2hr to <br/>
return back to Poor Farm Park.<br/>
<br/>
Directions to Poor Farm Park are available at:<br/>
<br/>
http://www.bikeracing.com/Rider%20Services/Trails%20Pages/poorfarm.htm<br/>
<br/>
In addition go 4.7mi from I95 Exit 92 interchange West out RT 54 to a <br/>
LEFT onto RT 810, Liberty Rd.  Follow all the way to the end and park <br/>
in 2nd Parking Lot for Shelter#3 (which has the prominent `payphone' <br/>
sign - and if you need to call, the number is 804.932.9839 - assuming <br/>
it takes incoming calls).  I didn't see any instructions about <br/>
reserving the shelter, so we will just take our chances.  You may <br/>
want to bring camp chairs just in case the 3 shelters are all in use <br/>
at lunchtime.  Keep in mind that at 9AM the grass will be wet with <br/>
dew - dress accordingly.  Dogs on leash OK, but I don't know about <br/>
the other parks.  No Glass and No Alcohol.  <br/>
<br/>

I will have 5 sets of maps for getting between parks  and a<br/>
Richmond map book to find the last park.<br/>
