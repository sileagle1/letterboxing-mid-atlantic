So, who has some addresses for ordering personal stamps?  <br/>
Is the stamp in a box (that I might hide) suppose to be the same as <br/>
the personal stamp that I 'log in' with or is each box suppose to be <br/>
different/pertinent to box name?  OK, I haven't read all of the <br/>
LB.org site/faq.<br/>
<br/>
But my ultimate goal is a walking tour in England 2007 -- and <br/>
letterboxing this side of the pond should help get me in shape!<br/>

Hope to meet some of you this spring? summer?<br/>

seen two that were the same. A lot of people carve/buy stamps <br/>
according to the theme or location of the box. The FAQs can <br/>
probably  help you some more - besides the main letterboxing.org <br/>
site, check out Silent Doug's www.letterboxing.info site - very <br/>
useful!<br/>

<div>Welcome! We are relatively new as well and spend a lot of time in your area so hopefully we'll meet. Check out the posts about the LBMA upcoming camping weekend in May. I am sure several fine folks will send you great ideas for getting your stamp, here's ours. One of our members, Carmen, LOVES to carve stamps and is pretty darn good at it. He has stated before that if anyone wanted a stamp carved he's be glad to do it. If you have an image that you can email us offline, along with your mailing address, Carmen will give it a go. If it turns out well we'll send it to you. We are trying to get our images posted but aren't particularly web savvy and have not yet been successful. Anyway, just a suggestion. Welcome again and have fun!</div>

would be surprised at what you create and then it's "your".  Sure <br/>
the first one will be crude but who cares.  Read the FAQs and hints <br/>
and ask questions and give it a go.  <br/>
<br/>
Meanwhile don't let that stop you.  Grab a store bought stamp and go <br/>
hunting.  Originally all letterbox stamps were storebought.  Making <br/>
them yourself developed later and many people still use store <br/>
bought.  The important thing is to "get out there."<br/>
<br/>
Happy hunting,<br/>
