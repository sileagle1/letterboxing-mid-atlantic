You dont "have to" ask on public<br/>

<div><span style="FONT-SIZE:10pt;FONT-FAMILY:Arial;">To be clear:</span></div>
<div><span style="FONT-SIZE:10pt;FONT-FAMILY:Arial;"> I think boxes should only be in public areas or with permission in non-public areas.</span></div>
<div><span style="FONT-SIZE:10pt;FONT-FAMILY:Arial;">Boxes should not present any problems: to the public, managers, land owners, etc. If they do any of the above they are nuisances not boxes.</span></div>

Have your 10 second description of letterboxing down pat.  Your tongue can get tangled when you try to ad lib a description of what we do.  It's good to include the concepts of "educational"  "family-friendly" and "ecologically conscious."<br/>

&gt; It seems to me that you'd have to have permission<br/>
&gt; to hide a box in a library. Am I correct? Many libraries<br/>
&gt; have cameras now so every nook and cranny seems to be<br/>
&gt; watched.<br/>

anyone who doesn't want to do it can skip it. It's been found quite a few times

feel I can not have a logbook if it helps to keep it hidden. If anyone at the 
library finds it for some reason it can just remain a mystery as to what it is. 
Unless they just happen to know about boxing. I live in New York City and my 
small neighborhood library no cameras. I think lots of libraries don't.

I believe that there are a ton of geocaches (and plenty of nonletterboxers) in the park that make it difficult to have many letterboxes there.<br/>

&gt; &gt; I disagree.... ....no surprise here huh?.....with getting permission. And if you know how to hide it, there is no reason why anyone ever has to know it's there. I have become a fan (though I've only done one so far) of the magnetic, no logbook letterbox which consists of a stamp with a backing glued on (unless you don't do backings--in which case skip that) and the magnet glued to that. Nice and flat and unobtrusive. Most shelves in libraries are metal and if not, use sticky backed velcro. I've had one outside in a location where I could never put a logbook and it's working great. <br/>
&gt; &gt;  <br/>
&gt; &gt; I put in the clues that there is no logbook so anyone who doesn't want to do it can skip it. It's been found quite a few times and no complaints yet. If boxes in series can not have logbooks in all of them I feel I can not have a logbook if it helps to keep it hidden. If anyone at the library finds it for some reason it can just remain a mystery as to what it is. Unless they just happen to know about boxing. I live in New York City and my small neighborhood library no cameras. I think lots of libraries don't. <br/>

&gt; &gt; It seems to me that you'd have to have permission to hide a box in a library. Am I correct? Many libraries have cameras now so every nook and cranny seems to be watched.<br/>

<div> </div>
<div>No permission, anytime or for anyplace.  For me, it takes away from the steathness needed to retrieve such a box that doesnt belong someplace.  It makes it more fun to have to be stealth, take longer to get the box, etc.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Now that being said, I tend to bend the rules of this game, and am not a true follower of the "old fashioned" rules.  In fact, to many I disrespect the "game" and its history by doing things outside the the norm in this hobby.  I look to expand things, and not stay stagnet with this hobby or anything..all thing evolve, so I respect those that try new ideas, invent gadgets, or creat mind blowing boxes.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>to each thei own, but knowing I am getting a box that has not been approved by officials seems far more rewarding.</div>

  huh?.....with getting permission. And if you know how to hide it, there is no 
  reason why anyone ever has to know it's there. I have become a fan (though 
  I've only done one so far) of the magnetic, no logbook letterbox which 
  consists of a stamp with a backing glued on (unless you don't do backings--in 
  which case skip that) and the magnet glued to that. Nice and flat and 
  unobtrusive. Most shelves in libraries are metal and if not, use sticky backed 
  velcro. I've had one outside in a location where I could never put a logbook 
  and it's working great. <br/>&gt;  <br/>&gt; I put in the clues that there 
  is no logbook so anyone who doesn't want to do it can skip it. It's been found 
  quite a few times and no complaints yet. If boxes in series can not have 
  logbooks in all of them I feel I can not have a logbook if it helps to keep it 
  hidden. If anyone at the library finds it for some reason it can just remain a 
  mystery as to what it is. Unless they just happen to know about boxing. I live 
  in New York City and my small neighborhood library no cameras. I think lots of

  &gt; I disagree.... ....no surprise here huh?.....with getting permission. And 
  if you know how to hide it, there is no reason why anyone ever has to know 
  it's there. I have become a fan (though I've only done one so far) of the 
  magnetic, no logbook letterbox which consists of a stamp with a backing glued 
  on (unless you don't do backings--in which case skip that) and the magnet 
  glued to that. Nice and flat and unobtrusive. Most shelves in libraries are 
  metal and if not, use sticky backed velcro. I've had one outside in a location 
  where I could never put a logbook and it's working great. <br/>&gt; &gt; 
   <br/>&gt; &gt; I put in the clues that there is no logbook so anyone who 
  doesn't want to do it can skip it. It's been found quite a few times and no 
  complaints yet. If boxes in series can not have logbooks in all of them I feel 
  I can not have a logbook if it helps to keep it hidden. If anyone at the 
  library finds it for some reason it can just remain a mystery as to what it 
  is. Unless they just happen to know about boxing. I live in New York City and 
  my small neighborhood library no cameras. I think lots of libraries don't.

&gt; There are a number of boxes in the city. I have two active ones left in Manhattan, and some near where I live. Did you do a search on AQ and lbma? They might not come out and shout Central Park but there are there. Some might be on lbma and not AQ. Always check both sites. There's one in lower manhattan, I have one in the village and the upper west side. "Peter The Fisherman" is also on the upperwest side. There's one called The Upper East side. "Goliath" is listed as in Central Park seems to be active and recently found. Stumped" is listed as Riverside Park. <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; There are a number of boxes. Just do some more research. <br/>

It's neat to finally put a face with the stamp/trail name you see in so many log books.<br/>

It looks like you've really traveled around a lot on boxing trips.  That's really neat.  We're pretty new at this so we're still working on all the boxes around our area.  Plus, Lightnin Bug is local so I have a ton of mystery boxes to work on that I have no idea where to even start with.  I LOVE THIS HOBBY!<br/>

  Did you do a search on AQ and lbma? They might not come out and shout Central

  sites. There's one in lower manhattan, I have one in the village and the upper 
  west side. "Peter The Fisherman" is also on the upperwest side. There's one 
  called The Upper East side. "Goliath" is listed as in Central Park seems to be 
  active and recently found. Stumped" is listed as Riverside Park. <br/>&gt; 
  <br/>&gt; There are a number of boxes. Just do some more research. <br/>&gt;

  &gt; I disagree.... ....no surprise here huh?.....with getting permission. And 
  if you know how to hide it, there is no reason why anyone ever has to know 
  it's there. I have become a fan (though I've only done one so far) of the 
  magnetic, no logbook letterbox which consists of a stamp with a backing glued 
  on (unless you don't do backings--in which case skip that) and the magnet 
  glued to that. Nice and flat and unobtrusive. Most shelves in libraries are 
  metal and if not, use sticky backed velcro. I've had one outside in a location 
  where I could never put a logbook and it's working great. <br/>&gt; &gt; 
  <br/>&gt; &gt; I put in the clues that there is no logbook so anyone who 
  doesn't want to do it can skip it. It's been found quite a few times and no 
  complaints yet. If boxes in series can not have logbooks in all of them I feel 
  I can not have a logbook if it helps to keep it hidden. If anyone at the 
  library finds it for some reason it can just remain a mystery as to what it 
  is. Unless they just happen to know about boxing. I live in New York City and 
  my small neighborhood library no cameras. I think lots of libraries don't.

The mysteries lie closer to the epicenter of PA boxing, the suburban Philly area.  Plant where the boxers are that like a good challenge say we.

&gt; I'll do a lot more research for NY.  THanks for all the ideas of where to begin.  I'd love to exchange sometime.  It is so neat to meet other boxers on the trail &amp; I'm really looking forward to attending my first event in a few weeks in Rehoboth DE.  It's neat to finally put a face with the stamp/trail name you see in so many log books.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; It looks like you've really traveled around a lot on boxing trips.  That's really neat.  We're pretty new at this so we're still working on all the boxes around our area.  Plus, Lightnin Bug is local so I have a ton of mystery boxes to work on that I have no idea where to even start with.  I LOVE THIS HOBBY!<br/>

&gt; &gt; If you do some research on the park you will find that there are areas where it is actaully quite easy to hide boxes. Most tourists don't explore a lot of the park. If I wasn't such a lazy sod, I could do a park project and plant 20-30 boxes there. I have found out about all kinds of locations. Just think small urban boxes. And be willing to go to locations and scout them out for where to put them and what the best container would be. It can be done. <br/>

&gt; &gt;   There are a few in the Central Park area right now, many more have been there in the past.<br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt;   I believe that there are a ton of geocaches (and plenty of nonletterboxers) in the park that make it difficult to have many letterboxes there.<br/>
