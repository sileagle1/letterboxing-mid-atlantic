2 for Scarab and first finder for Papa Woodwose's fantastic box!<br/>
<br/>
We didn't get to tease the kiltmaker that we were truly impressed by <br/>
Papa's box.<br/>
<br/>
Walking around for a bit, we passed one of Scarab's for a bit and <br/>
just kinda giggled watching a couple sitting right on top of it.   <br/>
Thankfully we'd already gotten it.  I wonder if anyone was waiting <br/>
for that couple to move on.<br/>
