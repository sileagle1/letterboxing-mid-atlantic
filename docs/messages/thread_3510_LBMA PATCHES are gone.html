                    <div id="ygrps-yiv-827281169">Well yo from Philly everyone,<br/>
<br/>
I've been out of touch working about a gazillion hours a week for the last year or so, only coming up for air occasionally. Anywho, hope all is well, Happy Birthday Pink Panther, and thought I'd update everyone on the patches.<br/>
<br/>
For the last 3-4 years I've handled the LBMA patches and just ran out of the last few of them. I won't be placing another order for a long time, if at all. If anyone would like to take this over please email me offlist at <a href="mailto:hikers_n_hounds@..." rel="nofollow" target="_blank">hikers_n_hounds@...</a> and I'll give you info on how I handled things, you can certainly do it your own way. THe main reason is time. I seem to have none anymore and poeple are waiting too long for me to check my emails and then get the patches in the mail to them. The second is money. It costs about $200 to place an order of 100, and you get the money back in $2.00 increments through the mail and at gathers. And in addition to time I seem to have run out of money as well.<br/>
<br/>
So, if anyone would like to keep the patches going let me know. It's a pain in the ass but a real labor of love. And they sure do look spiffy on a hat or back pack!<br/>
<br/>
I'm hoping to change jobs this year to get my personal life back and get back out on trail. Til then, Dude and I hope to meet as many of you as possible at an area gather. <br/>
<br/>
To all of my wonderful friends on this list thanks for keeping in touch while I've been out of touch and hope to see you soon! til then keep wearing your tie dye,<br/>
