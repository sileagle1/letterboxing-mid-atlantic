We will be there this Saturday and I'll be temporarily planting the African Penguin box for the day. I also have at least 2 new permanent traditional boxes to plant. If anyone is interested in coming, I'll have the clues for the penguin box and there are plenty of other boxes to find in the area. I'll have my PTs with me.<br/>
<br/>
Please email me if you are planning on coming so we can figure out a meetup time and location in the zoo. It closes at 4:00 and we'll be getting there around 1:00 - 1:30.<br/>
