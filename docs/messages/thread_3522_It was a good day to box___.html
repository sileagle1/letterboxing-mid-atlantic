<p>I'm planning on spending a week up in that area this summer. All those 
  boxes look awesome.<br/><br/>Turkey Mountain and the 3 legged dawgs are probably 
  also going to come for us this summer. Any hard hike is good, harder is 
  better!<br/><br/>-MMM<br/><br/>--- In <a href="mailto:lbma@yahoogroups.com" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">lbma@yahoogroups. com</a>, June

  of 3 blind mice's boxes. I'm on a mission to get them all. Froze me bum off

  land of the Sopranos. Met up with Jersey Trailblazer and hiked Turkey 
  Mountain. All of the boxes are nicely in place, with a new one coming on line 
  soon, dedicated to a volatile British Chef and a part of nearby Gotham. For 
  those who like such things, a hitchhiker with a solution to the nearby Three 
  Legged Dawg mystery has been planted in something with lots of steps.<br/>&gt; 
  <br/>&gt; The Tourne (great name for a thrash metal band) was a good next 
  destination, with lots of interesting features and boxes.<br/>&gt; <br/>&gt; 
  Dawgs were barkin', not just the three legged kind.<br/>&gt; <br/>&gt;
