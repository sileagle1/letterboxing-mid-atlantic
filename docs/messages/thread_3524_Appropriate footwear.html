&gt; hiking?  Do you have them wear hiking boots, sneakers, or something else?<br/>

Last year we bought them both hiking boots, and that seems to work the best.  The 7 year old will use his boots again, but this year the 5 year old will wear a pair of her brothers old Sketchers.  The sole is similar to a hiking boot, so it should work well.<br/>
