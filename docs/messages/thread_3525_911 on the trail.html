I called them back &amp; my daughter (6) came.  My son (4 1/2) didn't.  We started calling him, but he didn't answer.  We took off up the trail, but couldn't find him &amp; he didn't return our calls.  After 30 minutes, I called 911 &amp; was in the process of describing his clothes to the rangers, when he came on down the trail.  What a scare!  <br/>
<br/>
I am very thankful to be home with 2 children.  We set up some new rules for the kids after that.  Still got 6/7 of the boxes...which is a crazy hard hike!  No wonder it's listed as extreme letterboxing.<br/>
