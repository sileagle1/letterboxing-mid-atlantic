                    <div id="ygrps-yiv-1524840462">With Ken Lockwood - be forewarned - the road leading south out of Califon is closed about 3/4 mile from where the box it (really bad erosion of the roadbed).  If you come up from the south (from the High Bridge area - go north from Cokesbury Road onto Raritan River Road), you can get parking right close to the box.<br/>
<br/>
There is also a rail trail box on the rail trail that runs right through the Gorge.  Again, approach from High Bridge.  You'll need to walk a bit further for that one unless you climb up behind a train trestle (not somthign I recommend for an 84 yr old Dad!).<br/>
