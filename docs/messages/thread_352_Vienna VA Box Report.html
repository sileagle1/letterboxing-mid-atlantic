parks in Vienna VA. The following were all found:<br/>
<br/>
Where the Poison Ive Leaf Grows -- no kidding, <br/>
<br/>
You Got To Have 'Em <br/>
<br/>
3rd Nottoway Park of In The Park - Sports Series <br/>
<br/>
Clarks Crossing 2000 - good thing the book was double boxed, the <br/>
stamp bag was soaked.  And a portions of the path along the creek <br/>
have been seriously eroded with the rains -- but we didn't fall in.<br/>
<br/>
Could NOT Find<br/>
The Mole.  It is supposedly near a 'dry gully' which was wet and from <br/>
the debris collected at the trees had been a river at some point. And <br/>
the Happy Face at the playground couldn't be found. . . if it was on <br/>
the equipment, that looked recently painted.<br/>
