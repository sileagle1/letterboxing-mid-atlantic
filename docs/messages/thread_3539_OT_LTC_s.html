</span></blockquote>I don't think that is the case really.  I do think that folks are often <br/>
so very focused on the stamp that they do forget about the other things <br/>
that make a great letterbox great.  There are an awful lot of very <br/>
talented people out there, very good carvers that I could never hope to <br/>
match, and I love finding their stamps.  But in the end, for me, it is <br/>
about the entire package, not just the stamp but also the writing of <br/>
clues, beyond just directions, and the location, one that makes me want <br/>
to return.  I have found many amazing stamps that were seemingly simply <br/>
thrown out into the woods with little thought of these other important <br/>
elements to a letterbox.<br/>
