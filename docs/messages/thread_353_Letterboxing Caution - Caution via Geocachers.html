<br/>
I was doing some checking of my own boxes and ran into some <br/>
Geocachers that I had been corresponding with (they are new <br/>
Letterboxers as well).  They had told me about a problem spreading <br/>
through their hobby - theft of geocaches.  Geocachers like to use <br/>
ammo cases to stash their caches.  Apparently, some slimeball has <br/>
been purloining the geocaches that are made using the ammo cases.  A <br/>
fellow cacher may have interrupted who they perceive this slimeball <br/>
is when he was at a cache. Like most letterboxers, geocachers have a <br/>
sense of community and camraderie, but the suspected slimeball seemed <br/>
to have a 'God's gift' attitude and an overwhelming sense of <br/>
entitlement.<br/>
<br/>
Just cautioning everyone, but hoping not to alarm.<br/>

behind.  From what I understand it is the caches in the ammo cans.  <br/>
It originally started in the "slate belt" area of the Lehigh Valley <br/>
(Bangor, Pen Argyl, Wind Gap) and has spread to the greater Lehigh <br/>
Valley (Allentown, Bethlehem, Easton).  The local cachers are <br/>
justifiably upset and frustrated.  They have some suspicions, but <br/>
cannot absolutely prove anything just yet.<br/>
<br/>
Hope your are is safe,<br/>
