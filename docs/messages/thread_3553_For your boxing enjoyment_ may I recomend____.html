                    <div id="ygrps-yiv-1714394217">Spent the night in the town where my hubby works and did some early AM boxing. Nice tucked away little park, had been there with Sheba before but didn't have clues for this box with me at the time.<br/>
The air was filled with bird song and the delicate scent of wild flowers. The trees sparkled with the last of the rain. The sun was peeking out between silver clouds. <br/>
Found box easily, the biggest piece of snapware I've ever seen in wild. Took box back out and down the trail a bit as recomended. What! No LB, no Pink or Black Swan, no Sheba. Otis of course had been there.<br/>
I enjoyed this box alot, simple clues, great location, give it a try. 37</div>

Maybe someday when life 'tis not too busy [I am not such the box destructor and do have limited opportunity to box].  Seems like a nice 'overwintering spot'.<br/>
<br/>
Glad you enjoyed it,<br/>
