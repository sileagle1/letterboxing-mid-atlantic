We are overwhelmed at this time, as it turns out another body has been discovered.  Zodiac is in contact with me daily, and his codes have me puzzled.  I am sending this via blackberry, from a crine scene from today.  I will update you all on the newest case as details come in.<br/>

<br/>
Many have inquired about something I said, regarding the newest case.  Yes, you caught onto it.  If you did, you have already proven yourself worthy.  It will not be mentioned again.<br/>
<br/>
The captain has agreed to let me release all clues to the general public later today.  Look for an update in the Zodiac case later this morning.  I must warn you that the files are not for the queasy.<br/>
