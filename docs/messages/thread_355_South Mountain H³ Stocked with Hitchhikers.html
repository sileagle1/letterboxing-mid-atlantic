<br/>
The South Mountain H³ in Emmaus/Allentown, PA has been stocked with <br/>
hitchhikers.  "No Soup 4 U!", "The Blivet", "Penrose Triangle" and <br/>
Cichlid Guy's "Happy Duck" were placed in the H³.  As Cichlid Guy has <br/>
placed a Hitchhiker in there previously (Early Bird), he has become <br/>
the transporter for "No Soup 4 U!".<br/>
<br/>
If you visit the new Tom's Alien Spacecraft, you will be rewarded <br/>
with a shortcut to the H³.  Please don't snitch the bonus clue.<br/>
