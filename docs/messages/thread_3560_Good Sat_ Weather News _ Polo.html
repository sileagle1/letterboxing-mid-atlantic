Partly cloudy with a slight chance of thunderstorms. High around 75F. Winds SSE at 10 to 15 mph. Chance of rain 30%.<br/>
<br/>
Looks good to us. Hope to see you there.<br/>
<br/>
A few notes:<br/>
Driveway to Polo field is on N. end of park off Rt. 32 (River Rd.) Turn away from the river.  Drive slowly or stop if horses are moving on road or near cars.<br/>
<br/>
Stay behind the white chain, in front of the chain is in play &amp; may be full of charging horses. Polo balls &amp; horses are dangerous if one is coming at you DUCK  don't try to catch the ball. <br/>
<br/>
Children &amp; pets must be safeguarded at all times.<br/>
<br/>
Drinking water available at rest rooms behind Stover House on S. end of park 800' from polo field. 2 porta- rest units are @ field.<br/>
<br/>
Sun shades &amp; lawn chairs  are a good idea, there is often some free seating under N. big top. Near center field.<br/>
<br/>
We'll be set up @ Blue van, w/ stripped shade top.  SW corner of polo field.  If game is canceled we'll be in picnic area behind Stover House same gear.<br/>
<br/>
BOXES:  Are mostly traditional hides within 1.6 miles. The one way walk from NW.  box to SE. box is (with all in between) is about 3 miles.  NB. The Tiger Moth Box is not on this line (ie. not an  event box,) &amp;  you may want to drive to the airport.<br/>
<br/>
Area Box Clues, Exchange Lists, PT Clues, Event Box Clues, &amp; more, etc. are available at Atlas Quest.<br/>
Tiger Moth clues @ host table or on AQ Sat. AM.<br/>
BTW the Out of Ink box is 3.5 miles from polo, not 11. We are going to try it. <br/>
<br/>
Good Hunting to all, &amp; Best Wishes for the day However you spend it. m</div>
