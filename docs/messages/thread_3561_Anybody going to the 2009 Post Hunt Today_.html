We thought we had a chance going into "the end game" . . . and we did have most everything solved correctly. . . but when the sixth and final clue was released . . . it was waaaay different from the other clues and we didn't have a clue what we were doing. We had not even moved away from the stage. We were still contemplating what the clue meant when they announced they had a winner<br/>
It  was a multi-layered task, waaaay outside of the box and required using the solutions you had picked up in the first five clues in solving a new puzzle to yield a phone number, listening to a cryptic message that tells you how to decipher a code... running three blocks to view a poster to decipher a picture clue... that led you to a map with animated picture clues... that led you three blocks away to solve the identity of someone standing on a particular street corner. The winning team (from DC) solved it in an unbelievable 22 minutes! They finished 2nd last year so they knew what they were doing. A team from Miami finished 3rd. A father daughter team from DC finished 2nd.<br/>

Wait till next year!</div>

headlights.. . we froze. The winning team had six members... and they solved 
&amp; executed in 22 minutes. We will never know how long it would have taken us

the clue.<br/><br/>Next year we will be better prepared... Scarab will get a good 
night's sleep and show up on time... and you and Martini Man will be with 
us!<br/><br/>--- In <a href="mailto:lbma%40yahoogroups.com" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">lbma@yahoogroups. com</a>, "Debbie
