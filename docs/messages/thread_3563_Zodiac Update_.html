<br/>
Ms. Cabot's body has been discovered.  Zodiac is truly a twisted  <br/>
genius and the crime scene and evidence were vast, amazing, and  <br/>
unbelievable all at the same time.  There is no room for sloppy  <br/>
detective work.<br/>
<br/>
Although a body has been discovered, there are many questions that  <br/>
remain and much evidence leading to other suspected bodies in the  <br/>
vicinity of the late Ms. Cabot.<br/>
<br/>
This is no ordinary madman we are after, this serial killer will go  <br/>
down as a legend and his crimes are becoming more and more advanced.   <br/>
I look forward to receiving the case file or updates on the Great  <br/>
Falls disappearances as soon as you are able to forward.<br/>
<br/>
Arlington PD remains ever vigilant and ready to assist until this  <br/>
psychopath is put behind bars once and for all.<br/>
