Where pre 2003 boxes may be found.  There were a couple boxes in Jacobsburg planted in 1999 or so, and they were restored by Silent Doug in 2004 and they were also in the southern park of the park near Henry's Woods (cool old growth trees, btw).<br/>
<br/>
Consider it s serendipitous find, although it may have been a word of mouth box that the friends of the planter were not careful in their replanting.  It could also have been a geocache hybrid (mostly store boughts in there and other tradeable detritus), but there only appear to be regular geocaches in that particular park.<br/>
