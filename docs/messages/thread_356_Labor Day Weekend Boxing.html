son's college in Doylestown (Bucks County).  There are so many new <br/>
boxes that it is no longer listed on the "new" list so please look it <br/>
up .  This box is "squealing" for visitors.<br/>
<br/>
Also on Monday we found 5 boxes in PA- Winahawcawchunk, Cheshire Cat, <br/>
Abstract Guitar (all in Washington Crossing) and Delaware Canal <br/>
Bridge &amp; Bowman's Hill Tower.  We actually met Silent Doug &amp; Jennifer <br/>
on the trail and were thrilled to meet fellow letterboxers.<br/>
<br/>
Closer to home, we were only 1 for 3.  Found the first Campgaw Box <br/>
(NJ) but not the second.  Also gave up looking for the Down Under <br/>
first box in the series due to the rocky terrain.<br/>
