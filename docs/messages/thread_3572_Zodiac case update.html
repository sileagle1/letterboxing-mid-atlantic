I am the new lead detective in the Zodiac case.  I am in charge after the disappearance of Detective Tagaki.  He has not been seen or heard of since Saturday, when he was out invesigating a double murder scene in Great Falls.  I have been looking over his case files, and can confirm the double murder in Great Falls, the murder of Veronica, the disappearance of her sister Vanessa, and now the disappearance of BJ Tagaki.<br/>
<br/>
I want to congradulate the SRIA task force that solved the first case, and Detectice Zorket for her work on the case.  It seems it took many trips to the crime scene, and some great homework to solve the crime.  Each of you solved it differently, so nice work.  To the others that failed keep your head up high.  These murders are related, and each one must be solved in order.  It is impossible to solve the next murder without the previous.<br/>
<br/>
There is not much to go on in the the latest letter from Zodiac.  I will review it with my superior before releasing it to the detectives.  The newest jogger to go missing is Eddie S. Park.  We have no body, but the letter is all we have to go on.  We can't solve it and request help.  I will update here this week on progress.<br/>
