                    <div id="ygrps-yiv-1793035183">Had planned a litttle boxing in NJ yesterday. The plan was drop Hubby and son off at gun club where they would meet up with brother-in-law and I would head into the wilds of NJ to box for a couple hours and then meet at brother-in-law's house for boating and cook-out.<br/>
Well it took longer than I had expected to get to planned park then I was having trouble with what looked like straight forward clues,requrired identification of trees. <br/>
At that point got call from hubby,"we're done heading to the house, we'll wait for you so you can go out on the boat. Oh and by the way there's cold Blue Moon in the fridge" <br/>
Moral of the story, it alsways takes longer to find a box than I think it will.</div>

                    <div id="ygrps-yiv-998147963">Agreed!  One of the things I love most about this boxing is the varying levels of difficulty.  Some are easy &amp; you feel success.  Others are probably forever beyond my reach &amp; then there are all those in between at various levels which are awesome!<br/>
