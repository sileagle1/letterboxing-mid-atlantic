<br/>
Yeah, Dad found it when he mysteriously went letterboxing without <br/>
me!! It seems that as soon as you put out a new box in Lehigh county <br/>
my dad shows up-- he doesn't even have access to the clues! Anyway, <br/>
we moved "I love NY" westward.  I also wanted to let you know that my <br/>
cousin Zack wasn't quite sure what to do with the "Itch in PA" postal <br/>
box, and he gave it back to me this past weekend, so just to let you <br/>
know-- it's in the mail!!! Sorry for the delay.  <br/>

yes, i was in DE over labor day weekend and found your boxes. i also <br/>
took the opportunity to plant 3 more boxes in Lewes. i am happy to <br/>
report that Sussex Co. has more boxes planted than New Castle, and <br/>
Kent combined. an easy 14+ finds for the hungry letterboxer.<br/>
I did not find the HH :(<br/>
<br/>
i am envious over your Roosevelt Inlet box. i was eyeballing that <br/>
locale for over a month but you beat me to it!<br/>

of Allentown, PA on Labor Day...<br/>
<br/>
The Cihlid Guy came for an exchange and hunted for the Pool Wildlife <br/>
Sanctuary series with Tom from Team LB.  The old LB just watched and <br/>
chatted and checked the boxes to make sure they were OK.<br/>
Tom hid the Tom's Alien Spaceship Letterbox on South Mountain in <br/>
Allentown and we did some box maintenance and HH stocking in the <br/>
South Mountain H³.<br/>
Planted Seem Seed Farm - a weird little place.<br/>
Checked the following boxes and found all is cool - Rodale Bike Park, <br/>
General Trexler, Pass-Set-Spike and Rose Garden.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks to all the folks stamping in and rehiding properly!<br/>
<br/>
I also had an interesting, fulfilling encounter.  I can see the <br/>
general area of Pass Set Spike from where I parked the mean green LB <br/>
machine (my small green car).  When I was done checking the boxes, I <br/>
looked over and heard a kid scream and come running out.  I thought <br/>
he had found the boxes and was running over excitedly to show his <br/>
folks.  I jogged over and  introduced myself and asked if they were <br/>
letterboxers and and had found the box.  They said they were, but <br/>
instead of finding the box, the poor little guy found a bumblebee and <br/>
had gotten stung on the ankle.  Luckily, I still had my backpack and <br/>
was able to provide Dad with some first aid stuff.  This was their <br/>
second time out, so I showed them my books, stamps, etc and exchanged <br/>
with them.  The kids and folks were excited and I hope that we have <br/>
some permanent new members in the Allentown area!<br/>
