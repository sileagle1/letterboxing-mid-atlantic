It appears that a 'Copycat' has surfaced.  While we do have a team of dectives working on this case also, there are some hopes that this new problem will help to flush out the Zodiac.  Although I am one who has been working for quite some time to solve the Zodiac cases, there are others who have been working much longer than I.  I have brought those particular experts on board in this case as well.  They know the ropes.  They know what to look for, and more importantly, HOW to look.  It's all there if you read between the lines.<br/>
