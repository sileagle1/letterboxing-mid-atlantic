                    <div id="ygrps-yiv-98137451">I recently received a message from someone who calls himself "Detective L." Although he occupies his time in other parts of the world, he has taken up a case in our neck of the woods. A mysterious figure known as "He'up" is being charged with arson and robbery of multiple letterboxes and has even been known to set traps surrounding other hidden masterpieces.<br/>
<br/>
The Detective is currently in flight to SE PA. Within the next few days, he will stake out a location in the woods to attempt to catch the villain in an act of destruction and preserve the safety of all letterboxers. He hopes he will not be too suspicious hiding in a nook in some rocks. However, since there are so many possible locations for clues through PA woods (and urban areas) he need as much help as possible.<br/>
<br/>
I will be contacted with his location as soon as he hides himself. If you meet up with him, you will be sent further information from the detective departments on possible leads for clues. Over the next few months we will attempt to solve the mystery. There may be a reward, IF the criminal is caught.<br/>
<br/>
There is more information to come.<br/>

(I'll put it bluntly now - this is only a game and hopefully a fun way to give a direction to my upcoming plants. Some of the boxes will be straightforward clues but most will be difficult puzzles that require much research. There will be an end, so will be best to find them as they come, within a few months of their planting. However, the boxes will be in place for as long as they last.)</div>
