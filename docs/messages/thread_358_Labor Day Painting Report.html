I have enjoyed reading how you enjoyed boxing while we were painting <br/>
the front of the house. Just the front. It's sort of a trial run to <br/>
see how we should do the whole house. If I planted the house box <br/>
Erin suggested, you could all come by and vote on the color. <br/>
And "we" in this case is just me and the boys. Wayne has not the <br/>
gift of the brush. He built bookshelves. But, meanwhile, I <br/>
vicariously box by reading your stories.<br/>
Doug - Plywood? What plywood? Now I AM intrigued, and MUST go back. <br/>
(maybe after frost)<br/>
Art - We didn't find that second box either. I think the old bridge <br/>
got replaced by that culvert when they paved the parking lot and the <br/>
box went with it.<br/>
Ah, Down Under Series. Yes, indeed. One of our first finds. What was <br/>
it called? "Easy walk with one short climb", or something like that? <br/>
That is a classic Wingfoot clue. Note the name: WINGfoot. For the <br/>
rest of us lazy slobs, it's a long hike with a climb that leaves you <br/>
gasping, panting, and begging for helicopter rescue. Having said <br/>
that, if you allow a whole afternoon and bring lots of water and <br/>
GORP, and take your time, the view is well worth the hike.<br/>
