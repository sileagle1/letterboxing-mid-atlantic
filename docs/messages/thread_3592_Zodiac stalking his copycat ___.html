return (I'm back!"). To the delight of some and disdain of others fascinating<br/>
clues were released, a furious manhunt ensued, several locals took part in<br/>
"solving the Veronica Cabot case" by inspecting numerous "crime scene" locations<br/>
and close inspection of some unusual clue devices.... but then, as quickly as he<br/>
appeared... he disappearred leaving nothing but rumors of future challenges and<br/>
grisly adventure. (Very much adult themes here). In his wake remain new<br/>
personalities that may or may not be creations of the Zodiac: Tagaki, Spendlove,<br/>
Eddie Park, Calvin Hampton, Cold Bold Harry and now a new character...The<br/>
Gingerbread Man who seems to be publically taunting the Zodiac with a copycat<br/>
methodology.<br/>
<br/>
Unconfirmed reports indicate that the Zodiac is furious with this latest<br/>
character "The Gingerbread Man" and at this very moment maybe out on the trail<br/>
trying to eliminate this competition for the spotlight.</div>
