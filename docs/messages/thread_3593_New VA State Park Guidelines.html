quarterly visits.  Coming from someone who almost never checks on his <br/>

If your box is in decent shape then it may not actually need quarterly checks and if not, if it becomes a nuisance or trash, then quarterly checks are not enough.  State policies don't allow for such nuances, though.  <br/>
<br/>
The other part of this that I noticed and disliked was the time limit of 3 years for a box location - after that, the box has to come out.  To me, any box that can survive and be worthwhile after 3 years in a particular location is in a really good spot, one probably not easily replicated - safe enough, dry enough, etc.  After 3 years with no compelling adverse environmental impact, in a successful location, the box simply has to move?<br/>

<br/>
Which is why placement of boxes should be done with the protection of surrounding vegetation et al in mind.<br/>
<br/>
If a box can be found because of tracks of prior visitors then it is not in a suitable location and will most likely be discovered by the powers that be.<br/>
<br/>
If VA has funds for parks, it shouldn't be spent on rangers(?) hunting LBs.<br/>

If any kind of herd path forms then the park will pull the box or tell the placer to pull it, anyway, and that can happen in much less than a year.  <br/>
<br/>
In fact, considering the excitement typically generated by a new box, I would take the risk of herd paths to be greatest in the first few months.<br/>
<br/>
I mostly disagree with this part of the policy because if the box is associated with any sort of environmental harm then the box will have to come out immediately, so it seems a reasonable assumption that any box enduring for 3 years has not led to harm to the immediate setting.<br/>
<br/>
After 3 years, the box hasn't hurt anything or been destroyed or stolen by "the powers that aren't" - it's probably in a really good spot - so arbitrarily move it and hope that the new location turns out to be as good as the old one.<br/>
