                    <div id="ygrps-yiv-903977257"><div>This is sung to the tune of "Take me home country roads" and was suggested on the Red Hat Boxers list by Judy B. something about me being in West Virginia...LOL!!</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Anyway, had a GREAT weekend. The Old Timers Reunion is what gets me through the rest of the year. WV was beautiful, the weather was perfect. Carvin Carmen carved our grotto (caving club) logo into a really cool stamp and several members of the Commander Cody Caving Club went letterboxing with me on Saturday. We stamped in as CCCC, not H&amp;H. Anwywho, found the two boxes on Spruce Knob, the highest elevation in the state. And I planted 2. Now there are a total of 4 boxes on one of the most beautiful summits on earth. </div>
<div> </div>
<div>I meant to get the box up on Seneca Rocks and plant a memorial box to my mom there but....I forgot Mom! I left her ashes on my kitchen counter, I had meant to sprinkle them from the top of Seneca Rocks. Oh well, guess I'll just have to go back sometime soon. </div>
<div> </div>
<div>I also planted "The Windmills of Backbone Mountian" on route 219 near the windmills. Again, spectacular view and a damn good stamp by Carvin Carmen.  </div>
<div> </div>
<div>Looks like every here had a great time this past weekend. FdL is still moving and yes, it really does take forever. And if you ever do it again...I'll do the t-shirts! LOL!</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Cahilly's, if you really enjoy house painting 5100 Bay Road could really use a new coat of paint...or a lit match.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Well, I'm gonna go into work for a couple of hours and see what chaos awaits me upon my return tomorrow.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>I guess this weekend I'll pick up some stuff for the NJ gathering. What was that again? Oh yeah, soda, water, chips.....</div>

 That brought a much needed laugh.  We missed your<br/>
wonderful posts. I can't wait to read your input on<br/>
the  2 on-going lines on the press and membership.<br/>
Check out my stamp on RHLB.<br/>
