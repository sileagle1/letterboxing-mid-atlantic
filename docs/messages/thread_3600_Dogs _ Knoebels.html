<br/>
TeamHappilyEverAfter is seriously considering going to Knoebels, but we were wondering about bringing our dog Jak. <br/>
<br/>
Can everyone give me some insight on whether or not its a good gather to bring a dog along to?<br/>
<br/>
We were thinking if we bring him we might miss boxes placed in the amusement park? We don't want to leave him at a campsite alone. <br/>
<br/>
Thanks for any advice!<br/>

</span></blockquote>Knoebels is a dog friendly event because the park is dog friendly.  As <br/>
long as Jak is well behaved around other people (and dogs), you are <br/>
welcome to roam the park with him.  It is the only amusement park that I <br/>
know of that allows that.<br/>
<br/>
So, bring Jak along, we won't bite ;-)<br/>

It was breaking my heart to think Jak might not be able to participate as he is definitly part of our letterboxing team. Besides, he carries all of our stuff in his backpack.. and I don't want to get stuck holdin the bag!<br/>

You'll see us all there! (Jak, David &amp; I of HappilyEverAfter). <br/>

I think we might be bringing a new pair with us too (the PirateTurtles).<br/>
