<br/>
However, the reaction time frame is probably accurate - could even be less, depending upon your individual sensitivity, which tends to build - if you had poison ivy on your lower legs, for example, then your lower legs will react more readily to the next exposure.  In my own case, I once picked up poison oak on my forearms from carrying fire wood and I am sensitive to poison ivy on those patches, even years later.<br/>
<br/>
I think that other folks had good ideas about thinking of surfaces that get between your fingers (shoe laces, pet fur) and working backward from there.<br/>

I'm still going with someone at the gym or my neighbor's dog (or my own shoes from being in the woods a week ago) as my running theories.  And knock on wood, most of the itch has subsided..it just hurts a little now.  Can't wait for this to be over!!<br/>

&gt; Sometimes it takes a week to show up on me. Or you could have had it on your own shoes from some foray into the stuff. I have taken to wiping down my shoes and laces with a soapy dishrag after a hike. All the rest of the clothes go right into the wash. That will take care of the oils. For the current rash try calagel (R) it is clear and dries the rash pretty quick.<br/>

&gt;         If someone at the gym ran through poison ivy and got it on their shoe laces, then put the shoes on again and touched the equipment in the gym, it's not that far fetched.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt;         Or some variant of that.<br/>

&gt;           I currently have a lovely outbreak of PI between my fingers and I have no idea how I got it. I've had it before and thought that I had to have touched the oil fairly recently (within 24-48 hours). Anyone know if that time frame is accurate? If that's so, I got it from the gym or my office (both unlikely, I think!), as I haven't been out galavanting in nature in some time. <br/>
