                    <div id="ygrps-yiv-1763444675">I made the mistake of walking through a grassy field at Peace (Tick) Valley park back in mid may - Pulled 9 ticks off of me at various times that day and a deer tick that had latched on to a love handle.  It was mostly dead having been crushed by my jeans an belt that I had put on after showering.  Watched the area for bulls-eye, but the little stinker was only on me for a few hours and thankfully nothing occurred.  They need 24-36 hours to transmit Lyme (if they are infected).<br/>

Always do a tick check with a loved one.<br/>

<div><font face="Arial" size="2">I always spray, spray, spray. They also make some 
wipes you can use around your face, neck, behind your ears, places that if you 
don't want to spray around your face. I get mosquito bites in my hair!

<div><font face="Arial" size="2">Sorry you picked up the dreaded bug. I hope the 
meds work soon and keep it at bay. Is it supposed to be a total cure these days 
or can it keep coming back? I haven't kept up with what I assume are better 
treatments in recent years. I've been really good about checking since that one 
time, spraying really well and often. So far so good. I worry about using so 
much DEET but it seems to work best. </font></div>

<p>I spent the day hiking at Valley Forge yesterday. I had my long pants 
    tucked into my socks and both bug spray and bug sunblock on. I did a 
    complete tick check when we got back and didn't find anything. Just this 
    morning I saw a tiny black speck on my arm, the size of a pin head. I don't 
    know if I missed the spot yesterday or it took a hike while I was checking.

<p>I spent the day hiking at Valley Forge yesterday. I had my long pants tucked into my socks and both bug spray and bug sunblock on. I did a complete tick check when we got back and didn't find anything. Just this morning I saw a tiny black speck on my arm, the size of a pin head. I don't know if I missed the spot yesterday or it took a hike while I was checking. It was REALLY hard to see though but not engourged yet, thankfully.<br/>

&gt; I always spray, spray, spray. They also make some wipes you can use around your face, neck, behind your ears, places that if you don't want to spray around your face. I get mosquito bites in my hair! <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Sorry you picked up the dreaded bug. I hope the meds work soon and keep it at bay. Is it supposed to be a total cure these days or can it keep coming back? I haven't kept up with what I assume are better treatments in recent years. I've been really good about checking since that one time, spraying really well and often. So far so good. I worry about using so much DEET but it seems to work best. <br/>

DEET (N,N-Diethyl-meta-toluamide) is commonly known as the king of mosquito repellents, though not everyone is keen to slather it on their skin. A study conducted in the late 1980s on Everglades National Park employees to determine the effects of DEET found that a full one-quarter of the subjects studied experienced negative health effects that they blamed on exposure to the chemical. Effects included rashes, skin irritation, numb or burning lips, nausea, headaches, dizziness and difficulty concentrating.</p>
<p>Duke University pharmacologist Mohamed Abou-Donia, in studies on rats, found that frequent and prolonged DEET exposure led to diffuse brain cell death and behavioral changes, and concluded that humans should stay away from products containing it. But other studies have shown that while a few people have sensitivity to DEET applications, most are unaffected when they use DEET products on a sporadic basis according to the instructions on the label.</p>

                    <div id="ygrps-yiv-1637220113">While I will not argue that DEET is 100% safe (heck, even water can be toxic, given the correct circumstances), there is NO scientific evidence that DEET causes cancer or any of the effects the employees of the Everglades attribute to DEET.  Notice that article doesn't actually say that DEET causes those effects, just that the employes claim *they* thought the symptoms were from DEET exposure.  If you want to know what the toxicology studies and over 45 years of use have found out about DEET, read what the EPA or ATSDR (Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry) have to say.  These are organizations that are in place to protect us and the environment.   DEET was re-registered in 1998 and underwent rigorous toxicological testing for this.  An interesting aside - aspirin would not be licensed for use today if it were not grandfathered in because it would not be able to pass the current testing procedures.<br/>
<br/>As for the seizures, if you look at the data 1) there is no *causitive* link between the seizure and DEET use and 2) the rate of seizure following DEET use is actually lower than the rate of afebrile seizures in children.  <br/>
<br/>If you are totally set against using DEET, the CDC and EPA both have recommendations for several different insect repellents, including newer and botanical repellents.  I have not read or heard of any seizures antecdotes about these products, but keep in mind that these products have only been used for the past 5-10 years, compared with DEET's 45+ year history of use.  And any of these products will also help to product you against not only Lyme disease, but also other tick and mosquito-borne diseases.<br/>

DEET (N,N-Diethyl-meta-toluamide) is commonly known as the king of mosquito repellents, though not everyone is keen to slather it on their skin. A study conducted in the late 1980s on Everglades National Park employees to determine the effects of DEET found that a full one-quarter of the subjects studied experienced negative health effects that they blamed on exposure to the chemical. Effects included rashes, skin irritation, numb or burning lips, nausea, headaches, dizziness and difficulty concentrating.</p>
<p>Duke University pharmacologist Mohamed Abou-Donia, in studies on rats, found that frequent and prolonged DEET exposure led to diffuse brain cell death and behavioral changes, and concluded that humans should stay away from products containing it. But other studies have shown that while a few people have sensitivity to DEET applications, most are unaffected when they use DEET products on a sporadic basis according to the instructions on the label.</p>

&gt; My good friends DC Stones and Fluffy Angel have been diagnosed with Lymes Disease but are responding well to treatment (yea!) . . . with this knowledge and with awareness of just how abundant the ticks are this year.. I knew to take pre-cautions before a recent hike: long pants, long sleeves, under which I applied repellent cream lotion on arms, legs, neck and scalp (not much hair!) I sprayed boots and outside pants legs with Deep Woods Off (DEET)... I sprayed my shirt sleeves... my hat and saturated a kerchief which was tied around my neck.<br/>


&gt; <br/>
&gt; Protected.. right?<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; WRONG<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I got five ticks on my midsection.. right along my belt line<br/>

&gt; I didn't DEET my middle...  thats where they got me!<br/>

&gt; &gt; You would be miserable. Who can hike like that? Nobody does it. <br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; I always spray, spray, spray. They also make some wipes you can use around your face, neck, behind your ears, places that if you don't want to spray around your face. I get mosquito bites in my hair! <br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; Sorry you picked up the dreaded bug. I hope the meds work soon and keep it at bay. Is it supposed to be a total cure these days or can it keep coming back? I haven't kept up with what I assume are better treatments in recent years. I've been really good about checking since that one time, spraying really well and often. So far so good. I worry about using so much DEET but it seems to work best. <br/>

&gt; &gt;           Everybody says the ticks are AWFUL this year. I had a couple on me for an embarassingly long length of time recently and my doctor took some blood. Came back negative. I was told about someone who had to go to the doctor recently to get one taken out because it had gotten in so deep. And I know someone else who just found out she has it and is on the antibiotics. <br/>

&gt; &gt;             I hope you are ok. I was at my doctor this morning... follow up on 7 tick bites two weeks ago... he said everything was fine... didnt want test my blood for Lymes until I showed a sympton... he thought my bites had healed... (all the ticks were removed within two hours) and even though they were drawing blood for my annual physical they wouldn't test for Lymes...(?) ... so I am focused on lemons... I'm on my second Mikes Hard Lemonade... Vive La Revolution!<br/>

And spreading DEET/Cancer FUD when there is actual evidence<br/>

certainly not the worst, and it can actually present with<br/>
serious pathologies for which antibiotics are useless; I<br/>
personally know someone in such an unfortunate state).<br/>
<br/>
I suppose some never want science to get in the way of a good<br/>
round of green/Luddite FUD, but here is a brief summary from<br/>
a credible source.<br/>
<br/>
<a href="http://www.cdc.gov/ncidod/dvbid/westnile/resources/deetgen.pdf" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.cdc.gov/ncidod/dvbid/westnile/resources/deetgen.pdf</a><br/>

[1] No citation, as I said.  But look at the shoddy science.<br/>
"[health problems] that they blamed on exposure to the<br/>
chemical".  Who did the blaming?  Where is the demonstration<br/>
of causality?  What negative health effects did the control<br/>
group experience in the same environment, and what percentage<br/>
of the control group experienced them?  Was there even a<br/>
control group?  And so on.  I'm sorry, spraying people with<br/>
DEET, and then having them blame any presenting health problems on<br/>
the chemical simply is not science.  (And we don't even know what<br/>
the health problems are, or how serious they are -- the article does<br/>
not say -- for example, if the "health problems" are annoyances<br/>
such as headaches, they make for good statistics, but for many people<br/>
are less annoying than insect bites!).  The article is silent on<br/>
all of these questions, proving once again that anyone can and will<br/>
say anything in the name of FUD and whatever their agenda happens<br/>
to be (this one seems to be in the Luddite/"green" realm).  No<br/>
wonder everyone is so neurotic :)</div>

socks, the outside of the bottom of my pants and inside the pants on my lower 
legs. The two I had stay on me in all that time were just above my waist. So now 
I lift up my t-shirt (which is not tucked in) and spray there also.
