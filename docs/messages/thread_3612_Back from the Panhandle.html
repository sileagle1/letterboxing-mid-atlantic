<br/>
If you didn't know, Schizokeet and I were married on July 11.  Somehow <br/>
she manages to still be in love with me.  It was a great wedding and I <br/>
just wanted to thank everyone that helped make it such.  We had a ton of <br/>
stamps from all over the place, and in the coming weeks I will be <br/>
reaching out to the folks that spent much of their time and effort to <br/>
help make our wedding something very special.<br/>
<br/>
We had a great time on the honeymoon as well, got a bunch of <br/>
letterboxes, and even left a letterbox out there on a nice, hot, six <br/>
mile hike.  We even passed through St. Louis on Saturday, where there <br/>
was some sort of gathering going on, but didn't have time, or the <br/>
ambition for that matter, to stop there.  We did get a few nice boxes <br/>
there however.<br/>
<br/>
So, now I will concentrate on Knoebels, I hope to make it a great event <br/>
this year, I have some neat stuff in mind for everyone to have some fun <br/>
with.  Details will be coming for the gathering very soon.<br/>
