Although I know several of you LBMA boxers have contributed to the conversation (&amp; education) on AQ, I thought I'd post a few of the responses for those that don't follow AQ much:<br/>
<br/>
"Ok, so I think I am a bit behind on the whole Mapsurfer thing. Is this a specific planter? I don't see the name listed on AQ."<br/>
<br/>
"Evil? I contacted the Mapsurfer "Contact" person to ask about a box in my area.  He replied quickly and politely.  Why are they evil?"<br/>
<br/>
"Evil only because they can be hard. The one I'm working on doesn't seem to be that hard (knock on wood) but I have looked at others that completely elude me. There was one that there was a whole team of people that worked on it for over a year.<br/>
I'm sure the contact is very polite...it was nothing against MapSurfer. I think it's great that there is someone out there that has generated so much respect through his clues. What a compliment that is to him on his way of thinking and writing. I find his Colorado clue very entertaining. I'm sure I don't know the area well enough to figure ot out....but maybe in time.<br/>
Meanwhile hats off to MapSurfer because he appears to be quite a legend! :)"<br/>
<br/>
"I wonder if some of the boxes have been checked on. Some were planted 10 years ago with no finds... It would be awesome to find it, but it makes me wonder if it is still there."<br/>
<br/>
"I was just wondering about that. As far as I can tell they are not listed on lbna or AQ (how many other boxes are like that?). There is nothing on the website that gives you any idea as to whether the boxes are still active or were planted years ago and then abandoned."</div>

&gt; &gt; A certain someone (or two) listed a link to the Mapsurfer clues on AQ.  Although I know several of you LBMA boxers have contributed to the conversation (&amp; education) on AQ, I thought I'd post a few of the responses for those that don't follow AQ much:<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; "Ok, so I think I am a bit behind on the whole Mapsurfer thing. Is this a specific planter? I don't see the name listed on AQ."<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; "Evil? I contacted the Mapsurfer "Contact" person to ask about a box in my area.  He replied quickly and politely.  Why are they evil?"<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; "Evil only because they can be hard. The one I'm working on doesn't seem to be that hard (knock on wood) but I have looked at others that completely elude me. There was one that there was a whole team of people that worked on it for over a year.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; I'm sure the contact is very polite...it was nothing against MapSurfer. I think it's great that there is someone out there that has generated so much respect through his clues. What a compliment that is to him on his way of thinking and writing. I find his Colorado clue very entertaining. I'm sure I don't know the area well enough to figure ot out....but maybe in time.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; Meanwhile hats off to MapSurfer because he appears to be quite a legend! :)"<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; "I wonder if some of the boxes have been checked on. Some were planted 10 years ago with no finds... It would be awesome to find it, but it makes me wonder if it is still there."<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; "I was just wondering about that. As far as I can tell they are not listed on lbna or AQ (how many other boxes are like that?). There is nothing on the website that gives you any idea as to whether the boxes are still active or were planted years ago and then abandoned."<br/>
&gt; <br/>
