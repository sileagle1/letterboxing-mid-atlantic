                    <div id="ygrps-yiv-1075303811">When I was in VT this past June hiking alone and while stamping in -- there was a loud bang (snap?) and I looked ahead into the woods to see a huge branch fall - or maybe the whole tree?  It went so fast.  There wasn't even a slight breeze -- must have been squirrels jumping on it.  And since light travels faster than sound it would have been too late even if I had been looking straight at it.  No, make that trees move faster than me.<br/>

                    <div id="ygrps-yiv-1741931003">I did two years ago doing some of your boxes at Ridley Creek.  I was on the blue trail which made a big loop and I heard the creaking noise of a tree starting to lean as I was just starting the trail.  The groaning continued as I worked my way through the several boxes on the loop.  Then when I was 3/4 of the way around the loop and sitting on the ground stamping into a box I heard a much louder groan and watched an entire tree come down about 100 feet away from me.  I have to admit that it terrified me to think that it could have hit me had I not stopped to stamp into a box.<br/>
