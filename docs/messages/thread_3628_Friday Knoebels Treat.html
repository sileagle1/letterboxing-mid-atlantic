and camping for the gathering, there is a great treat planned for you.<br/>
<br/>
True Indigo has let me know that she and the rest of the Crayola Posse <br/>
will be planting a night series at the nearby Conrad Wieser State <br/>
Forest.  It will be planted on Friday night only, the clues for it will <br/>
be removed Saturday morning before the gathering.<br/>
<br/>
The starting location for the series is the same location as for my Hike <br/>
It, Bike It series <br/>
(<a href="http://www.penncoasters.com/letterboxing/hikebike.htm)" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.penncoasters.com/letterboxing/hikebike.htm)</a>.  Directions and <br/>
a map can be found with the clues for this series.  The clues for the <br/>
night series will be posted on the board at that parking lot.<br/>
<br/>
This should be a lot of fun for those coming out early to camp from some <br/>
of the best boxers in the area.<br/>

</span></blockquote>You are on your own to reserve a site (1-800-487-4386).  I have reserved <br/>
the site Quabec-X.  There are a bunch of other sites left in the Quebec <br/>
loop last time I looked.  Sites are going very fast, they seem to go <br/>
faster each year, so if you plan to stay the night I would reserve soon.<br/>
