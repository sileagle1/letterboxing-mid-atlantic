<br/>
After a summer of rain and cold, the heat wave hit Portland, Bar Harbor, St John &amp; Halifax the few days the Grandeur of the Sea docked.  But we got out before Bill rocked the ship.  Left Boston on Thur and arrived Balt on Sat AM.<br/>
<br/>
In St John, someone said with the humidity the heat index was 102degrees -- and to think I was walking 4-6 hrs each day.  Must now look up "sun poisoning" -- splotches have finally faded from back of legs (above the hiking boot line -- not a pretty sight!)<br/>
<br/>
Hope MizS has a cooling comfortable excursion.<br/>

The owner clued me in that the drink to have in heat is a "steamer".<br/>
Steam milk (via capauchino machine), add some crush mint, and let cool just a bit so you don't burn your tongue.  Raises body temp and mint is refreshing so the heat doesn't feel so bad.  <br/>
<br/>
And per the web it doesn't appear to have been sun poisoning (no nausea, not even tender, no blisters - just big red splotches, hot to the touch, and slightly itchy - and now in 5 days it is gone!?!)<br/>
<br/>
Sound the trumpets . . . I posted the clues to the boxes I planted.  Although I had a heck of a time trying to remember which stamp was planted in which city and which photos were my clue notes.  3 hrs and 5 boxes later, I now know why I only carve and plant and skip the posting!!<br/>

Dropped a new log book in a box I had in CT (i havent been back to it in 3 yrs) over the weekend and took the old one. While paging through it I realized Wanda and Pete had stamped in! I was SOOO thrilled. <br/>
