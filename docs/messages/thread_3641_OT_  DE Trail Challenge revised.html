<div><font face="Arial" size="2">Anyone interested in completing the DE state parks 
trail challenge should take note that the program has been revised.  We 
started the challenge this week and found that while the parks are still stocked 
with the old cards, there are new cards and they list different trails.  
The challenge now has 3 levels - 5, 10, or 15 trails - which is nice for those 
of us who have short-legged hikers along or those who really don't want to trek 
from one end of the state to the other multiple times.  However, not all 
the trails on the old card are still part of the challenge.  The new card 
is online and the program information can be found at : </font></div>

<div><font face="Arial" size="2">Also, New Castle County, DE has devised its own 
trail challenge.  There are no markers to find, just an honor system of 
logging when you walked a trail at this or that park on the list.  Cards 
can be found at the NCCo public libraries.  All of the county cards must be 
completed by December.</font></div>
