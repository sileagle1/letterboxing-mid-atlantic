of interest here, too. Seems Yahoo is looking into making changes in <br/>
Groups. Like going from all free to adding a premium (paid) level <br/>
service with more features (like registration for events,and <br/>
collecting the money, increased memory, etc.) and reducing features <br/>
on the free groups. (mainly less storage capacity in the <br/>
files/photos, etc., it seems)<br/>
<br/>
Take the survey here:<br/>
<a href="http://sweepstakes.yahoo.com/groupspremiumsurvey2" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://sweepstakes.yahoo.com/groupspremiumsurvey2</a><br/>
<br/>
The other groups told me to vote for continuing with free, but I'm <br/>
not about to think for you. Make up your own mind. I like free <br/>
stuff, too, but I can't help thinking of Irene and the T-shirts, and <br/>
the recent questions of safeguarding clues on the main board.<br/>
<br/>
Now, don't start flaming, just take the survey.<br/>

repetative. If you'd been wearing your (not white) T-shirt you would <br/>
have seen it. Something was there about "would you like the ability <br/>
to collect dues for your group/fees for registrations/blah blah."<br/>
I guess they would use a PayPal type thing? Do we care?<br/>
<br/>
Art - You just missed it. Irene had T-shirts made up with the LbNA <br/>
logo and name on the front and a big compass on the back, <br/>
saying "Where Are You Boxing This Weekend?" and "Letterboxing Mid-<br/>
Atlantic" Very cool shirts. But to get them made she needed a <br/>
minimum order of 75, and she sent notes, posted order forms, <br/>
collected all the money, including shipping costs, shipped shirts, <br/>
and to top it all off - THAT's what started the last gathering: We <br/>
were trying to get together to get our shirts without the shipping <br/>
fee. <br/>
Doug took the easy route by using CafePress.com, where they handle <br/>
everything, but it limits you to white or grey shirts because of the <br/>
transfer method they use.<br/>

<div>Actually, it wasn't too bad. I'm just a big ol' whiner. The problem was I set an arbitrary date for the gathering before I had all of my facts up front. If you look up "fools rush in" in the dictionary you will see my picture there. I thought I could send the screen printer the artwork and viola! out comes a T-shirt! Doesn't work that way. I had to convert the artwork to a vector format, something I have not worked in, or pay the screen printer $25 an hour to do it for me. So the rush was getting the checks in and the artwork done in time to buy the shirts and allow for the 3 week turn around time for decorating and delivery to me all by July 9th. But it all worked out in the end and I really love my shirts so it was worth it. </div>

<div>Congrats on your achievement! I am hoping to reach 100 by my 1 year LB anniversary in January. But if not, I sure am having fun trying! And Carmen and I love to plant! He likes it better than hunting and hiking. There is such a thrill checkiing your boxes and reading the log books that I never get tired of.</div>

No kidding.  My goal was to reach F100 by my first anniversary <br/>
(11/11/3) which I did. Then I signed up to receive the F100 PLB.<br/>
<br/>
I believe that was in December or January and I'm not sure where it <br/>
is now.  I ordered a bunch of F100 patches to include in the box too.<br/>
<br/>
Now it's just a waiting game.<br/>
<br/>
Now my count is P24 F217 X58 = PFX299 <br/>
<br/>
My goal of F200 by 11/11/4 has been achieved and my personal standard <br/>
ratio of 1 P per 10 F is okay.<br/>
<br/>
I HAD a goal of P50 by 11/11/4, but I'm going to give up on that.<br/>
<br/>
I need to streamline my life and not put so much pressure on myself.<br/>
<br/>
I think I'll still try to have F300 by 11/11/5. As time goes by, I'll <br/>
need to start going further and further away to achieve my goals.</div>

Indigo Vulture's F100 milestone also had me looking at my PFX count and <br/>
dates, too. And I started doing some quick calculations of my own, too:<br/>
<br/>
I reached F500 this past labor day, which was 27.25 calendar months after <br/>
finding my first letterbox. That means that I've found 18.3 letterboxes <br/>
each month on average since I started.<br/>
<br/>
I've planted 38, but I've also adopted 19 more, including rescuing a couple <br/>
of boxes from the letterbox basement and restoring a couple that had been <br/>
missing or damaged beyond use. We've also made a couple of attempts at <br/>
restoring some other abandoned boxes, which I figure is good for our P <br/>
karma, as well, so I think I'm well within in your range of 1 P per 10 F, <br/>
as well. As soon as Jennifer reaches F300 (only 7 more to go!), then we're <br/>
going to focus on planting more. (Of course, that also depends on her <br/>
getting over her, um, *obsession* with catching up to my F count, though <br/>
I'm not sure how that works since every time we go boxing together my F <br/>
count also goes up....)<br/>
<br/>
:-)<br/>
<br/>
The thing is, all numbers aside, the biggest thrill I get from boxing still <br/>
comes from a great hike, like restoring the Pinnacle and Pulpit Rock boxes, <br/>
or from the challenge of figuring out clues like the Nolde Forest series -- <br/>
not from racking up a big F count.<br/>
