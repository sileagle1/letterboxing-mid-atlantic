<br/>
Last night, I arrived at 4:59 at PHL on a flight from Nashville, TN. ('twas out in the Paducah, KY area for work this week).  I called MRs. Bug to let her know that I'd be beginning the drive home.  She says, cool and then calls me back in about 5 minutes to let me know that I-95 south out of PHL is backed up from DE to the Airport, the Blue Route (I-476) is also backed up and that the Northeast Extension is basically shut down between Lansdale and Quakertown.  Accidents galore, according to Mrs. Bug.  This would have been the way home.<br/>
<br/>
So, as we ride the bus (not the short one) to the long term parking lot, other passengers and I noticed how messed up 95 is and I decided that I would try I-95 north past Philly along the Delaware.  I recall from boxing gatherings at Tyler SP that you can get from 95 to Tyler via 332 and from Tyler it is a little over an hour home to Alientown via Doylestown, Quakertown and the dreaded construction through Coopersburg (still messed up in case anyone asks).  So, I decide that is the was to go.  Luckily, boxing has trained me to keep a PA gazeteer under the passenger seat so enable boxing locales.  I checked it and drove on my merry way.  Left the lot at about 6:00 and made it home at 8:00 pm.  Had there not been hellacious construction traffic in Coopersburg (again, avoid 409 through there at any cost), it would have been 7:50.<br/>
<br/>
So, I did manage to call MizScarlet at the beginning of the adventure and waved at HnH as I passed Bensalem, gave a salute to Cyclonic's former stomping grounds as I passed Bristol and Cornwall Heights, and gave a yo to Cherish through Doylestown and felt itchy from ticks as I passed Peace Valley.  I wondered, what eevil clue could I write for this misadventure.<br/>

<br/>
That is my usual way when I can take the turnpike (to Mill Hill Road).  Since I was coming from the east on this trip, I decided to bypass the heart of Quakertown by getting off of 313 at 212 and sneaking around the back way.  I should have gotten to where you suggested when I had the chance, but was thinking "Hey, it's 7:40 pm."  Forgot Cooopersburg had 3 poorly timed traffic lights.  LOL.<br/>
