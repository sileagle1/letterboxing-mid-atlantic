<br/>
Had tapas dinner with the former and her sister Janet &amp; Mark in Old Town Alex this evening.  <br/>
<br/>
HnH has been busy with work and trying to straighten out family life.  Told her to buck up and get out on the trails to clear that muddled head of hers.  <br/>
<br/>
I would have told her MizS has a special one, but apparently HnH had already been that route with Sheba - who also said "It's not that bad" (Mt Misery).<br/>
<br/>
Dude is suffering from itchy butt and has about gone bald back there.  Hopefully he regains some covering before winter cold sets in.  Vet is still amazed he is mobile.<br/>
<br/>
HnH now has Boxtoberfest on her RHB'r calendar - as well as the pre-pub-crawl-logistical meeting in DE Oct 10.  <br/>
<br/>
She also promises to get the Tyler gather posted.  I'll call her again next week to remind her!!<br/>
<br/>
But she still isn't watching the boards or responding to her emails.<br/>
