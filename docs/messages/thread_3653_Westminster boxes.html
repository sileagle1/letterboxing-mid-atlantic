<br/>
Just heard that my box at the Westminster, MD Baugher's fruit market and restaurant (Buy the Bushel)has disappeared, so if this is on your list to get, scratch it off for now. :&gt;(<br/>
<br/>
I had two boxes at the Lions Park in Union Mills out for maintainence. (This park is next to the Union MIlls Homestead Park- where I have The Mill planted!) I've replaced both Lions Park boxes. The "Lion's Lair" box is a new carve. The last was destroyed by mold and water. This box is in a new, more weather-safe location, so if you plan to get it print new clues.<br/>
<br/>
Hope you are all enjoying this beautiful letterboxing weather!<br/>
:&gt;)<br/>
