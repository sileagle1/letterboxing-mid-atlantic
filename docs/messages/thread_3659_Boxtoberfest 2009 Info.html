Just a reminder that the Boxtoberfest gathering is just around the corner!  We have a great event planned and look forward to seeing everyone who signed up.  If you haven't already signed up, you still can on AtlasQuest.  Also we have planned a pre-gathering meet and greet at Isaac Newton's pub in Newtown for Friday night.  Come and have a beer and unwind with us.  You can also sign up for this event on AQ.  Thank you, Lotus &amp; Celtic Cat</div>
