 stamped in with individual bat stamps, I used my personal travellor, Dancing Bear Bat, and finally we planted the boxes. Have you ever planted boxes with a bunch of people? Lot's of opinions, but they were so enthusiastic I let them call the shots. After all, the box was dedicated to them. </div>

Look at the old cemetary...." and so it goes until I'm ready to smack him one real good! Nah, just kidding. He's too darn cute. Anyway, I liked his idea about the Mason Dixon box and will be doing that one soon.

&gt;I just wanted to elaborate a little on what a great weekend I had in WV. <br/>
&gt;Several members of my caving club, including Mr. Irene, went with me to <br/>
&gt;Spruce Knob to plant. But before I planted the boxes they were so tickled <br/>
&gt;with our club logo stamp that Carvin' Carmen carved they all stamped their <br/>

&gt;HUGE bat tattoo on my....um nevermind) and...STAMPS! So they all grabbed <br/>
&gt;different bat stamps and off we went. We found the two boxes already on <br/>
&gt;"The Knob" and couldn't plant the Commander Cody Caving Club box until we <br/>
&gt;were done hunting as we used that as our team stamp. We all stamped in with <br/>

&gt;<br/>
&gt;Then on the way home Monday Mr. Irene and I stopped and planted the <br/>

<div><font face="Arial" family="SANSSERIF" size="2">Anyway, I had a pretty good weekend.  I found my first mystery box on Friday, and a hard one at that, Mat Hatter's Hitchhiker Hostel.  The only thing was, I forgot to bring along my HH, so I will have to return.</font></div>
<div><font face="Arial" family="SANSSERIF" size="2"></font> </div>
<div><font face="Arial" family="SANSSERIF" size="2">On Saturday I did some box maintenance, as well as hunting.  I found both boxes of the Big Green Monster.  Great location, nice stamps, and the camo really hides them well.</font></div>
<div><font face="Arial" family="SANSSERIF" size="2"></font> </div>
<div><font face="Arial" family="SANSSERIF" size="2">I replaced the log (actually, the whole box but for the stamp) of my Bowman's Hill Tower box, after just two months it had already filled up with 33 log-ins.  Some were from as far away as Seattle (Amada) and Oklahoma (Kingfisher).  I was thrilled with it.</font></div>
<div><font face="Arial" family="SANSSERIF" size="2"></font> </div>
<div><font face="Arial" family="SANSSERIF" size="2">Well, I was busy the rest of the weekend, so that was it for my boxing adventures.</font></div>
