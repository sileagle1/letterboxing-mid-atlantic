                    <div id="ygrps-yiv-1227033026">Talked with HnH - she had wanted to hold the Tyler gather in the hostel gathering room - so she posted the event and then contacted the hostel.  Well, sometime in Nov the hostel is shutting down.  Not sure if this is a winter thing or a forever thing - HnH was going to contact them again to get the details.<br/>
<br/>
Without sleeping rooms at the hostel, the organization is more than HnH can handle what with work being the way it is . . . long days &amp; long weeks.  So she took the event down.  I think she sent emails out to the two folks who had jumped on it immediately.  You can fuss at me for talking her into avoiding the 'stress'associated with having an event.<br/>
<br/>
HnH plans to be at Boxtoberfest for the day - since it is just a hop and a skip from home.  <br/>
