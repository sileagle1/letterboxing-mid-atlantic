</span></blockquote>Well, it is about freaking time they are doing that.  There is no forest <br/>
there, just a bunch of trees, the deer have eaten everything.  It also <br/>
creates a very dangerous situation on area roads.  I used to drive <br/>
through the park at night in the truck, and could easily spot 50 or more <br/>
deer at road side alone.  I think they are underestimating the herd in <br/>
there.<br/>

&gt; I just will never understand the slaughtering of animals in THEIR home.Â  We do share this planet with other beings and just because we have cars and roads, doesnt make it okay to kill them.Â  To say they are destroying forests seems wrong...they are eating.Â  What's the cure for overpopulation of humans?.....<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Imagine if there were a superior creature to us on earth, that came into our houses and just killed us for reasons they saw fit?..the fact these deer are being lured and baited with food is sickening...Imagine being hungry yourself, opening the frigde, just to get shot in the head.....<br/>

<br/>
</span></blockquote>Neglecting, of course, to point out that "nature" neither<br/>
defines "fittest", nor "weak", nor does anyone else, a point<br/>
often missed by those with this ideology (and others, I<br/>
suppose).  For more interesting reading, one may wish to dig<br/>
up another letterboxer's thoughts on these matters (Kirby), and<br/>
my rebuttal.<br/>
<br/>
Beyond that, I would suggest to the moderator that the thread is<br/>
moving towards uncomfortable off-topic. :) (and who am I to not<br/>
help it along)<br/>
<br/>
But, while I'm here, I would suggest that BullDawg's logic could<br/>
be equally applied to suggest that you should let termites eat<br/>
your shelter rather than kill them.  Interesting to note that<br/>
the best practice for killing carpenter ants is to bait them with<br/>
food that is actually poison that they take back to their nest in<br/>
an attempt to kill the whole nest.  But, since these things are<br/>
farther down the being chain, it doesn't apply, does it?<br/>
<br/>
Who knows?  There seems to be a value judgement (at least among the<br/>
majority of respondents), that the biomass of Valley Forge vegetation<br/>
is more desirable than the biomass of Valley Forge deer (certainly<br/>
those who run thru the woods at VF on a routine basis would likely<br/>
disagree, but that seems tangential).  Given that it seems likely<br/>
that the cervine biomass has more intelligence and consciousness<br/>
that the vegetable biomass, I would be hesitant to quickly make<br/>
such a judgement myself.  (It would be interesting to look at the<br/>
biomasses in question and make value judgements based on caloric<br/>
potential).<br/>
<br/>
(In any case, for more interesting arguments by smarter people,<br/>
one need simply to google "elephant culling" Africa).<br/>
<br/>
So, what is one to do?  I guess keep on keepin' on, and follow the<br/>
KISS principle.  Drown me in the shallow water, don't let me get<br/>
too deep.  Hope that I am fit enough to survive nature this day,<br/>
and hope that this putative creature postulated by BullDawg doesn't<br/>
eat me, 'cause that wouldn't be good, would it?  In the mean time,<br/>
I won't kill any deer unless I need to to survive, but I will still<br/>
reach out and pet them as I run in VF, which, unbelievably, I do on<br/>
a regular basis, given how they have been so desensitized to<br/>
predation.<br/>
<br/>
As a final note, there is a bear in French Creek as well.  I've<br/>
even seen it.  Pretty cool. :)<br/>

Its just odd that we as humans and government can say that we have an issue with animals destroying land and plants when whom infact destroys the most of the earth on this planet?..WE do.

<br/>
</span></blockquote>The chain is not a factor for me.  If animals were attacking my home, I would have a reason to defend it.  Killing an animal for eating is way different.  Besides, we choose to tear down trees to build homes, which is food for termites.  Thus I can not blame them for trying to get full tummies...even if it is my house.<br/>

Just so all know where I am coming from, I value all creatures the same.  We all have the same right to be here.  I even avoid killing bugs, and choose to take them outside if they do come into my house.<br/>

&gt; I just will never understand the slaughtering of animals in THEIR home.Â  We do share this planet with other beings and just because we have cars and roads, doesnt make it okay to kill them.Â  To say they are destroying forests seems wrong...they are eating.Â  What's the cure for overpopulation of humans?.....<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Imagine if there were a superior creature to us on earth, that came into our houses and just killed us for reasons they saw fit?..the fact these deer are being lured and baited with food is sickening...Imagine being hungry yourself, opening the frigde, just to get shot in the head.....<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; sad story from my perspective.....<br/>

&gt; &gt; "Valley Forge National Historical Park officials plan to begin killing more than 1,000 deer at the park over the next four years.<br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; The<br/>
&gt; &gt; park wants to reduce a deer population now estimated at 1,277 to around<br/>
&gt; &gt; 175. The sharp-shooting operations could start as early as next month.<br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; Opponents say the park is ignoring more humane options, like contraception.<br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; Officials<br/>
&gt; &gt; at Valley Forge, site of the Continental Army's 1777-78 encampment, say<br/>
&gt; &gt; the herd is gobbling so many plants, shrubs, and saplings that the<br/>
&gt; &gt; forest cannot regenerate.<br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; The shooting would be conducted by<br/>
&gt; &gt; federal employees or contractors firing high-powered, silencer-equipped<br/>
&gt; &gt; rifles, mostly at night. The deer will be lured to areas baited with<br/>
&gt; &gt; apples and grain."<br/>

forest or more deer, but rather a question as to it being healthy for <br/>
both (not to mention myself when I drive through there at night).  Fact <br/>
is, there is nothing to stop the deer from growing in population (beyond <br/>
the traffic on Rt 23).  They are destroying the forests there, and thus <br/>
destroying their own food supply.  Thus the herd there has to be culled <br/>
less it starve itself to death.<br/>

And typically the meat is give to the food pantry, though venison cheese <br/>
steaks would be awful good.<br/>

<p><br/><br/>&gt; Neglecting, of course, to point out that "nature" 
  neither<br/>&gt; defines "fittest", nor "weak", nor does anyone else, a 
  point<br/>&gt; often missed by those with this ideology (and others, I<br/>&gt; 
  suppose). For more interesting reading, one may wish to dig<br/>&gt; up another 
  letterboxer' s thoughts on these matters (Kirby), and<br/>&gt; my 
  rebuttal.<br/><br/>Just because we dominate this world doesnt mean we can't 
  share it with the other creatures. Any idea why there are large groups of 
  animals in parks?...maybe, just maybe because we have destroyed so much of 
  their home that they are forced the retreat to the areas that have food and 
  vegetation so they can survive. Its just odd that we as humans and government 
  can say that we have an issue with animals destroying land and plants when 
  whom infact destroys the most of the earth on this planet?..WE do. Its a 
  double standard. We can destroy land and earth, but animals cant eat without 
  it being called 'destroying' vegitation? <br/><br/>&gt; Beyond that, I would 
  suggest to the moderator that the thread is<br/>&gt; moving towards 
  uncomfortable off-topic. :) (and who am I to not<br/>&gt; help it 
  along)<br/><br/>this is a great topic...moving along very well 
  infact<br/><br/>&gt; But, while I'm here, I would suggest that BullDawg's logic 
  could<br/>&gt; be equally applied to suggest that you should let termites 
  eat<br/>&gt; your shelter rather than kill them. Interesting to note 
  that<br/>&gt; the best practice for killing carpenter ants is to bait them 
  with<br/>&gt; food that is actually poison that they take back to their nest 
  in<br/>&gt; an attempt to kill the whole nest. But, since these things 
  are<br/>&gt; farther down the being chain, it doesn't apply, does 
  it?<br/><br/>The chain is not a factor for me. If animals were attacking my 
  home, I would have a reason to defend it. Killing an animal for eating is way 
  different. Besides, we choose to tear down trees to build homes, which is food 
  for termites. Thus I can not blame them for trying to get full tummies...even 
  if it is my house.<br/><br/>Just so all know where I am coming from, I value all 
  creatures the same. We all have the same right to be here. I even avoid 
  killing bugs, and choose to take them outside if they do come into my 
  house.<br/><br/>&gt; Cheers<br/>&gt; Randy<br/>&gt; all in good fun 
  :)<br/><br/>Double Cheers to a well spoken debate...<br/>BD<br/><br/></p></div></blockquote></span></blockquote></html>

&gt; I think there is less of a question here as to if there should be more <br/>

&gt; is, there is nothing to stop the deer from growing in population (beyond <br/>
&gt; the traffic on Rt 23).  They are destroying the forests there, and thus <br/>
&gt; destroying their own food supply.  Thus the herd there has to be culled <br/>
