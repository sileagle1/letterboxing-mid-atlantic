                    <div id="ygrps-yiv-1937883662">Hi All.<br/>
<br/>
You probably all know that my fave boxing buddy is my son Tom.  Most of you know him as "Kirby Rider", "Star Wars Lego", "Tony Tony Chopper" or his current encarnation "The Masked Sculptor".  He changes his trailname with each logbook he fills.<br/>
<br/>
Tom is also a Boy Scout, and he is just about finished with his Hiking Merit Badge.  The ultimate thing is a 20 mile hike.  He has done five 10 milers, and this is the last major hike.<br/>
<br/>
On Sunday, 11 October, we will partake in this 20 miler on the Perkiomen Trail - weather permitting, of course.  We will start at Green Lane Reservoir Park and walk down to Central Perkiomen Valley Park near Schwenksville, have some lunch in Schwenksville (pizza or McFood) and walk back to Green Lane.<br/>
<br/>
We expect to be at Green Lane around 8 AM, Schwenksville around noon and back at Green Lane around 4 PM.<br/>
<br/>
Tom has carved a series of letterbox stamps and would like to share these with folks who accompany us for any portion of the hike.  You walk 1 mile with Tom, you get 1 stamp.  You walk 2 miles, you get 2 stamps.  And so on....  I am not sure how many he has prepared, but they all look pretty cool - especially for fans of the Anime series "One Piece."<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, if you are interested in meeting up to "Walk with Tom," check my AQ profile for our cell number in case you wish to call when we are out on the trail.  I think he would appreciate the encouragement.<br/>
<br/>
Cheers,<br/>

barking, but we did it. The last 3 miles were the most difficult. PA
Dreamcatchers of Schwenksville were kind enough to join us for the morning leg.<br/>

Perky Trail is at near peak for leaf peepers. Next weekend ought to be awesome.<br/>

<br/>
We chose a flat, smooth, relatively easy trail for this with minimal elevation gain, so all I'll need to do later today is a little extra stretching and I'll be fine.  That and the chocolate milkshake for lunch yesterday helps.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for the kind words.<br/>

&gt; Congrats on the big trek!!  We've done 20+ mile hikes a few times in the<br/>
&gt; past and it can definitely be trudge near the end.  However the more often<br/>
&gt; you do it, the easier it seems to be.     Hope you guys can move tomorrow!<br/>
