<br/>
I've got standing room tickets so no set location.  If anyone sends me a message either here or through Atlasquest, telling me you're going to be at the game and want the stamp, I'll bring it with me.  Please get in touch with me before 3:00 Sunday.  After that it'll be too late!<br/>

Rollins Repeat - World Series, is still in place!<br/>
<br/>
And I've already got Rollins 3-Peat in progress! :)</div>
