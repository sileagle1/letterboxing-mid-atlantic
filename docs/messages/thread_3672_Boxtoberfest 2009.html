<br/>
We camped Friday night, it was cold but we stayed dry around the fire.  <br/>
Wish we could have stayed Saturday night.  And, the sun actually did <br/>
come out.  The hiking was great, I think we did the Blue Dot Trail <br/>
twice, very nice, I still love this park.  We also checked on six of the <br/>
fairies as we were going by, all were in good shape, not many have found <br/>
them all.<br/>
<br/>
So many thanks to Celtic Cat and Lotus for putting on such a great show, <br/>
it was a lot of fun, and while it may be cold, the park is wonderful <br/>
that time of year and I too think it should remain Boxtoberfest.<br/>
