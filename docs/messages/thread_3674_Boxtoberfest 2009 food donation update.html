All food items were delivered to the New Britain Baptist Church Food Larder on Monday morning.  The Food Larder Volunteers were very grateful for the donations that were made.  <br/>
<br/>
When Wednesday Bowler and I arrived at the church there were several people standing in line, in the cold, waiting to be admitted to select their food items.  I have to admit it made me a bit sad, and I did tear up some as I thought about how fortunate and grateful I am that we were able to make this food donation on behalf of the LBMA group.<br/>

Photos of the event have been posted by Handstwo, Travelin' Shutterbug and myself on the AQ Boxtoberfest 2009 event page, if you care to view them.<br/>

Thanks again,<br/>
