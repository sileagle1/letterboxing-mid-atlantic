&gt;<br/>
&gt; Please don't look to me for a clever clue or a long hike (although I've been known to solve some of the most difficult _and_ I can walk for miles). I've even heard that some people appreciate my carving abilities. Apparently that is not enough for the new know-it-alls. Letterboxing used to be for everyone and suddenly I miss 2002.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; This is probably the most anyone's ever heard outta me and I will probably regret it in the morning. Sorry, and goodnight. I have to get up early to walk in the rain for cause, not a letterbox.<br/>

<br/>
</span></blockquote>I don't think that is really the problem either.<br/>
<br/>
I like boxes that are just directions with a nice little walk in a nice <br/>
park.  They are fun, get you out, and all.<br/>
<br/>
I think the problem I have are the boxes that could be nice but are <br/>
not.  Take, for instance, "Bruno (Off Leash)" <br/>
(<a href="http://www.atlasquest.com/showinfo.html?gBoxId=115455)" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.atlasquest.com/showinfo.html?gBoxId=115455)</a>.  We found this <br/>
box a few weeks ago while camping at the park.  It is the only box at <br/>
the park which has several miles of nice, easy trails.  Disappointingly, <br/>
the box is not along one of those trails, but instead it is right off <br/>
the parking lot right at the trail head.  I mean, really, it doesn't <br/>
take much to actually go for a little bit of a walk and plant a box down <br/>
the trail.  But they chose not too, and it really then seems to be a <br/>
waste, it is planting just for the sake of planting.<br/>
<br/>
The same goes for another nearby box, "Cherries on Top" <br/>
(<a href="http://www.atlasquest.com/showinfo.html?gBoxId=77208)" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.atlasquest.com/showinfo.html?gBoxId=77208)</a>.  Great historic <br/>
location, lot of trails, and this too is right next to the parking lot.<br/>
<br/>
These are the boxes that I find disappointing.  It doesn't have to be a <br/>
long walk, or wonderful, clever clues, to be enjoyable.  But these boxes <br/>
were planted simply for the sake of planting a box, and really, why <br/>
bother.  It is these boxes and others like them that are making me a bit <br/>
more selective about what we go searching for.<br/>
<br/>
It is also these type of boxes that make me think about what we are <br/>
doing wrong.  Maybe I need to start planting very nice, well thought out <br/>
"Little Boxes."  Boxes that have easy clues but along nice walks with a <br/>
nice box at the end.  At the same time I think maybe I need to create <br/>
some that are more in shape with their surroundings, boxes that are <br/>
there for a reason, and not to simply be there to have a letterbox <br/>
there.  I do think it goes both ways, there is learning to do on both sides.<br/>

I mean, really, it <br/>&gt; &gt; doesn't <br/>&gt; &gt; take<br/>&gt; much to actually go for
 a little bit of a walk and plant a <br/>&gt; &gt; box down <br/>&gt; &gt; the trail. But they chose not too, and it really then seems to <br/>&gt; &gt; be a <br/>&gt; &gt; waste, it is planting just for the sake of planting.<br/>&gt; &gt; <br/>&gt; &gt; The same goes for another nearby box, "Cherries on Top" <br/>&gt; &gt; (http://www. atlasquest. com/showinfo. html?gBoxId= 77208). <br/>&gt; &gt; Great historic <br/>&gt; &gt; location, lot of trails, and this too is right next to the <br/>&gt; &gt; parking lot.<br/>&gt; &gt; <br/>&gt; &gt; <br/>&gt; &gt; -- <br/>&gt; &gt; Nathan Brown<br/>&gt; &gt; <br/>&gt; &gt; AKA Cyclonic<br/>&gt; &gt; Penncoasters. com<br/>&gt; &gt; <br/>&gt; &gt; The Insensitivity rolls on...<br/>&gt; &gt; <br/>&gt; &gt; <br/>&gt; &gt; <br/>&gt; &gt; <br/>&gt; &gt; <br/>&gt; &gt; <br/>&gt; &gt; <br/>&gt; &gt; <br/>&gt; &gt; <br/>&gt; &gt; <br/>&gt; &gt; <br/>&gt; &gt; <br/>&gt; &gt; <br/>&gt; &gt; <br/>&gt; &gt; <br/>&gt; &gt; <br/>&gt; &gt; <br/>&gt; &gt; <br/>&gt;
