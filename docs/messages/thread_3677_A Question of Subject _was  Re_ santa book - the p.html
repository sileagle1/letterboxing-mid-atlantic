<div>I don't see how this is AQ's fault! Just because it has bells and 
        whistles such as LTC's, virtuals, and such, doesn't give anyone the 
        indication that AQ leans towards the quick find. What I think has 
        happened is when someone plants a drive-by, there is always a copy cat. 
        Someone else has to plant a drive-by box too.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>If I may use my state of New Hampshire as an example. I just 
        planted a box on top of a mountain reaching 3,475 feet. You had better 
        believe I got some flack for that. I gaurantee that there will be very 
        little finds for that box. </div>
<div> </div>
<div>It would seem that the more people that begin letterboxing, the 
        more likely they are to wanna find quick boxes. A website is not going 
        to encourage this, one way or the other. I have my share of drive-by 
        boxes and no websites swayed me in that direction. It was inevidable 
        that letterboxing was gonna grow and change some. When it did, no one 
        was forcing you to come along. It was up to you to come along for 
        the ride.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>And I couldn't help myself but, for someone that doesn't care for 
        the bells and whistles on AQ, you certainly found the block for your 
        finds in your logbook. What are you hiding? Drive-bys? And look at all 
        those blue-diamond plants! Must make you proud!</div>

<div>I think if we 'vets' planted boxes that are what the 'vet's 
                want to find, maybe the 'rooks' would get the picture..... .I 
                think I try to do that at least, and its proven cause I have so 
                many boxes with limited finds over years of time, and that is 
                exactly how I like it.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>...but like I have always said, AQ's features themselves 
                lean towards the quick need for art and reward via virtuals, 
                LTC's, and the like...That HAS changed the game, and it is hard 
                for boxers to the LEAD the way, when one of the biggest websites 
                out there guides them differently. ...It all starts from 
                there....</div>
<div> </div>
<div>TF mentions she wishes it were 2002?..wasnt that when times 
                were simple, there was no AQ?.....I don't like the road we are 
                headed, but it just makes me limit my finds, and weed out the 
                garbage out there...We have littered, not taught to this

<div>Bleh, this whole thread (not just this particular post) 
                    is bringing me down, man. Maybe after I sleep on it I will 
                    comment, but probably not because obviously I've joined the 
                    curmudgeon ranks. When I started boxing in 2002...no, not 
                    going there.<br/><br/>Please don't look to me for a clever 
                    clue or a long hike (although I've been known to solve some 
                    of the most difficult _and_ I can walk for miles). I've even 
                    heard that some people appreciate my carving abilities. 
                    Apparently that is not enough for the new know-it-alls. 
                    Letterboxing used to be for everyone and suddenly I miss 
                    2002.<br/><br/>This is probably the most anyone's ever heard 
                    outta me and I will probably regret it in the morning. 
                    Sorry, and goodnight. I have to get up early to walk in the 
                    rain for cause, not a letterbox.<br/><br/>D.<br/><br/>"And

When I started boxing in 2002...no, <br/>&gt; not going there.<br/>&gt; <br/>&gt; Please don't look to me for a clever clue or <br/>&gt; a long hike (although I've been known to solve some of the most <br/>&gt; difficult _and_ I can walk for miles). I've even heard that some <br/>&gt; people appreciate my carving abilities. Apparently that is not <br/>&gt; enough for the new know-it-alls. Letterboxing used to be for <br/>&gt; everyone and suddenly I miss 2002.<br/>&gt; <br/>&gt; This is probably the most anyone's ever <br/>&gt; heard outta me and I will probably regret it in the morning. <br/>&gt; Sorry, and goodnight. I have to get up early to walk in the rain <br/>&gt; for cause, not a letterbox.<br/>&gt; <br/>&gt; D.<br/>&gt; <br/>&gt; "And that's all I have to say about that."<br/>&gt; <br/>&gt; <br/>&gt; <br/>&gt; <br/>&gt; <br/>&gt; <br/>&gt; <br/>&gt; <br/>&gt; <br/>&gt; </span></blockquote></div>
