Mrs. Bug originally wanted me to, so I went for about the first 30 minutes.  I just walked around the hood and ran into them a couple of times and only asked which way they were going to go.  Then I came to the conclusion how pointless it was, finished the shiraz and went home and explained the reasoning behind my decision.  No problems.<br/>

They had a cell phone with them - was enough.<br/>

<br/>
Back in the day in a suburban county just east of MissMoon's current home, we would get home and hit the streets in our local neighborhoods.  Had about 2 hrs from 3-5 or so, when it got dark (remember, that DST ended in October in the olden times).  Then it was a quick dinner and out again to a different neighborhood until people stopped answering their doors.  Of course, shaving cream and powder socks.  Never egged.<br/>
<br/>
Kind of like boxing.  Just one more - gotta get that last one!  LOL<br/>

&gt;   I thought your kids were old enough to go themselves by now.  or do you live somewhere that they need to be driven?  My dad only took us until we were 6 or 7.  After that we went crazy ourselves.  We lived on the border of two communities and sometimes trick or treat were on different days in each community.  Boy, did we make a haul!!!  We'd make stops back at home to dump out our bags so they wouldn't be so heavy and then we'd head out for MORE.  And then we'd get to do it on ANOTHER day! We had enough candy to last us until St. Nick's on DEC 5 (and we certainly weren't skimping on our candy intake between OCT 31 and DEC 5!).<br/>

the city realized most of the neighborhoods were doing it at night, regardless
of the “official safe time” and a few years ago Halloween got
switched to when it SHOULD be – on actual Halloween night, regardless of
what day of the week it falls.  So yes, people CAN have an influence to

Eventually the city realized most of the neighborhoods were doing it at night, 
regardless of the official safe time and a few years ago Halloween got 
switched to when it SHOULD be  on actual Halloween night, regardless of what

The HS kids marched on and the little ones went to the cafeteria for a party.  The principal was in costume and was the sweep.<br/>

It was adorable to watch and good for me in that no way could I get any testing done, so I left early.<br/>

As a kid, I remember one year when my father towed my wagon around for candy storage, discarded costume accessories, etc - wagon somehow came to be a rolling beer exchange for the fathers - was the tradition for years after that.<br/>

&gt; Some schools now are actually not allowing kids to wear scary costumes to Halloween functions. I'm sorry, but that's just ridiculous. I think some of them are just letting the kids wear orange and black or they are having some kind of lame "Fall Themed" thing. Come onnnnnnn. <br/>

&gt;   &gt; I thought your kids were old enough to go themselves by now. or do you live somewhere that they need to be driven? My dad only took us until we were 6 or 7. After that we went crazy ourselves. We lived on the border of two communities and sometimes trick or treat were on different days in each community. Boy, did we make a haul!!! We'd make stops back at home to dump out our bags so they wouldn't be so heavy and then we'd head out for MORE. And then we'd get to do it on ANOTHER day! We had enough candy to last us until St. Nick's on DEC 5 (and we certainly weren't skimping on our candy intake between OCT 31 and DEC 5!).<br/>

&gt; Just had our first few trick-or-treators at the door tonight.Â  Our suburb used to have trick-or-treating on a Sunday afternoon near Halloween, but our subdivision always did it at night.Â  Eventually the city realized most of the neighborhoods were doing it at night, regardless of the âofficial safe timeâ and a few years ago Halloween got switched to when it SHOULD be â" on actual Halloween night, regardless of what day of the week it falls.Â  So yes, people CAN have an influence to get at least some things back.<br/>
&gt; Â <br/>
&gt; (BTW â" When we were kids, we also used paper grocery bags and pillow cases.Â  Weâd stop at home to dump the contents on our beds when they got too heavy, then head out for more.Â  Weâd have to hide the better things, especially Almond Joys, because my dad would always try to sneak them.)<br/>

<p>Well, yeah! That's why you have the little ones empty the candy bag mid evening. You tell them it's for a quick stop at home to warm up.
