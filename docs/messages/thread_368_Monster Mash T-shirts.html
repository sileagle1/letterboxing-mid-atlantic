Hi Judy!<br/>
<br/>
I was just talking with Chuck about shirts last night!  The design is <br/>
done and approved for the event stamp which is also the image going <br/>
on the shirts!  I will be offering T-shirts for $10.00 or Sweatshirts <br/>
for $15.00.  Not sure of a color yet that will probably depend on <br/>
what's available and in what sizes.<br/>
<br/>
I would like to take orders ahead of time for sizes and payment can <br/>
be made at the event.  If you would like to coordinate orders from <br/>
anyone on your list that would be great.  Just email me names and <br/>
sizes and which shirt they would like.  I will also have a few hand <br/>
made hiking sticks for sale for $15.00.<br/>
<br/>
I will probably have a few extra shirts for sale at the event too but <br/>
I'm hoping to mostly have orders in advance!<br/>
<br/>
Anna<br/>
-----end copy--------<br/>
<br/>
So, LBMA folks, I will take your orders OFFLIST and batch them to <br/>
Anna/mommafox.  Just copy/paste the following into an email to me : <br/>
<br/>
sowbiz @ yahoo . com   <br/>
ORDERS MUST BE PLACED BY WED SEPT 15 for me to batch to Anna.  <br/>
<br/>
NOTE: LBMA Posted Orders will not be taken -- must be emailed.<br/>
<br/>
If you are not going to the MMM but want me to carry a shirt back, <br/>
you will need to contact Anna/mommafox to send her a check -- but let <br/>
me know you have done so and I will pick up the shirt and bring it to <br/>
the SoJersey Gather -- otherwise we will work out something.<br/>
<br/>
