not box at all this weekend, but did have a very nice hike to Mary's <br/>
Rock (see www.penncoasters.com).<br/>
<br/>
Last weekend we were up in Gettysburg where we planted a couple of boxes <br/>
and found a few others.  Had a very good time for our last camping trip <br/>
of the year.  "Bloody Shrapnel" is an excellent hike, and well worth <br/>
it.  Of course, Pink Panther and Black Swan beat us to it the day before <br/>
(should have let us know you were to be in the area, I had extra <br/>
"drinks" at the campsite).  That box was my highlight of the weekend, <br/>
just a wonderful hike.  Caledonia itself is a very pretty park, think we <br/>
will have to return.<br/>
<br/>
Today we did do a little box maintance.  A very old box, "Clark's <br/>
Crossing," which can be found in the letterbox basement, is still alive <br/>
and well, but needed some help.  I dried out the old logbooks and <br/>
provided a new logbook, as well as a new, watertight box (with luck).  I <br/>
have one logbook left that had been wet in the box.  I will return it to <br/>
the archive in the box in a few weeks.  These books are very cool to <br/>
look through, and are a who's who of letterboxers in NOVA.  It seems the <br/>
box was an early find for many, and it is really cool looking through <br/>
all the old stamps.  Would love to see the box taken out of  the <br/>
basement, don't know what the qualifications are that put it there, but <br/>
it is alive and now very well, and I hope some new folks get a chance to <br/>
go out and visit this classic.<br/>

 difference or if someone else gave a nudge.  Some of Erik's boxes have more recent recorded finds and have still been moved to the basement.<br/><br/>I'm sure some enjoy the fact that few people think to mine the basement and other techniques for abandoned clues.  From Choi's standpoint, I can understand wanting someone to be responsible for each listing.  Good luck.<br/></div><div style="font-family:times new roman, new york, times, serif;font-size:12pt;"><br/><div style="border-left:2px solid rgb(16, 16, 255);margin:5px 0px 5px 5px;padding-left:5px;font-family:times new roman, new york, times, serif;font-size:12pt;"><font face="Tahoma" size="2"><hr size="1"/><b><span style="font-weight:bold;">From:</span></b> Nathan Brown &lt;Cyclonic07@...&gt;<br/><b><span style="font-weight:bold;">To:</span></b> lbma@yahoogroups.com<br/><b><span style="font-weight:bold;">Sent:</span></b> Sun, November 29, 2009 9:02:18 PM<br/><b><span style="font-weight:bold;">Subject:</span></b> [lbma] Where Did You Box This Weekend?<br/></font><br/>

&gt; Planted a box Thanksgiving Day before the festivities. Friday I was a total sloth (although manage to clean and decorate the tree). Saturday 8 mile hike around Gettysburg and managed a box or two on the way. :-) Lovely stamp, my friend!<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Sunday another long hike in French Creek (6, 7, 8, I don't know the exact mileage) and planted two in homage of an intrepid boxing team (did you get my email Otis?). There was some type of race going on. It was fun to sit at the old water fountain on Six Penny and listen to the comments of the racers as they rounded the bend. "Ugh, Oh, Oh My!" were heard as they saw the upcoming hill when they turned the corner. I was eating lunch and one racer said: "That looks like more fun than this!". I let her know it was most enjoyable. <br/>

&gt; &gt; Hid some light eevil on Friday (with thanks to Lotus and Leafcutters - so stalk their logbooks, not mine!), went to norther NJ with Indigo Vulture on Saturday - interesting stuff out that way.  Sunday, just walked around the Little Lehigh snapping some photos of odd things, seeing red foxes while scouting new hiding areas and generally enjoying the day.<br/>

We had a great time finding a newer kid-friendly series there.  We went to check on the first box we ever found, hearing that it was recently relocated.  We found the area, but judging by the primitive stick shelters built in the area, we suspect that the SPOL was muggled by an educational program.<br/>

this weekend.<br/>

Last weekend we did go into DC and managed to come up with several boxes <br/>

so we decided to stick to plowed paths.<br/>
<br/>
This weekend we headed over to Riverbend Park to finish up the Choose <br/>

many ours and miles of hiking.  Great clues and over all wonderful <br/>
boxes, each of them.  There is one we did not get, but it is close by so <br/>
we will return later and finish it up.  Schizokeet and I are so out of <br/>

weeknight walks.<br/>

Got some of my stamina back and was glad not to be huffing and puffing like the last time (although my behind angel was visible, butt, that's another story). Snow was there, but melting nicely. Waved to my boxes, because they were snow covered.<br/>
<br/>
Sunday, a lovely drive to adventures with Sheba. We allowed 5 hours for mystery boxes, but finished up early! Yippeee! Explored and had lunch at a sunny picnic table. Watched a kid totally enjoy the experience of spring while we ate lunch. Made it home in time for a nap before the man made it home from his hike.<br/>
<br/>
Twas a great weekend!<br/>

<div><font face="Arial" size="2">Well, the only trail I hit this weekend was 
historic Greenwood cemetery in Brooklyn. It's a huge, beautiful cemetery. It was 
gorgeous out and I'm glad I went because the box I found had been vandalized but 
everything was still there. I took everything with me to replace the container, 
etc. The owner is in Rhode Island, so...</font></div>

we speak, so I feel it has been a productive weekend. Even saw a movie.

Explored the new Ralph Peterson Urban Wildlife Refuge in Wilmington.  It's cute but small.  Had the dogs with me so didn't go into the office area on the 4th floor.  Someone more stealthy than I can plant there.<br/>
<br/>
Tried Banning Park but it was crawling with people.  NOT my favorite wildlife but the kites were fun.<br/>

Came home and played ball with Sandy while Otto dug to China.  I'll try again this week while everyone else is at work.<br/>

 but the kites were fun.<br/><br/>Came home and played ball with Sandy while Otto dug to China.  I'll try again this week while everyone else is at work.<br/><br/>geckospot<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>------------------------------------<br/><br/>Yahoo!
