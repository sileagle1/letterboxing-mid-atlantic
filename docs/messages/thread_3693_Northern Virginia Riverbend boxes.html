                    <div id="ygrps-yiv-1296624249">For those Lb-ers who notified me of my Muskrat Ramble 2007's disappearance:  I finally went looking myself and found it in a pile of wood (evidently the remains of a near-by footbridge), tossed there perhaps by park workers. The box, logbook and stamp are fine and I will be replanting them somewhere in the vicinity next week. Thank you all for letting me know it was missing. It was the replacement for Muskrat Ramble 2, which vanished for 3 weeks and mysteriously was back in place when I arrived with M.R.2007. M.R.2 was itself a replacement for the original Muskrat Ramble, planted in 2002 and vandalized in 2006. Planting boxes well off-trail does prolong their lives, it seems.<br/>
