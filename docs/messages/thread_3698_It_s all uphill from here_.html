Can you tell it is getting just a touch brighter in the evenings?  Here in eastern PA, the date of the earliest sunset is not the date of the Solstice.  In most calendar years, the earliest sunset day actually preceeds the solstice by about 2 weeks.<br/>
<br/>
According to the Farmer's Almanacc, Dec 7-8 are the days of the earliest sunset in Alientown, PA, with sunset being about 16:35 EST.  Daylight is 9:22 long.<br/>
<br/>
The Winter Soltice occurs on Dec 21 and daylight is 9:16 long.  The sun actually sets at 16:38 EST on the Solstice.<br/>
<br/>
The date of the latest sunrise is 4 January at 07:26 EST.  Sunset on that date is 16:46 EST.  Daylight is also 9:22 long on this date.<br/>
<br/>
The reason for this is the progression of Solar Noon to being later in the day during the time period from about early November through early February during the solar winter.  You actual times may vary, depending upon where you live, but the trends transcend location.<br/>
<br/>
So, it is all uphill from here for those late afternoon boxing missions.  Sorry to all those that get out before sunup, but astronomy is what it is.<br/>
