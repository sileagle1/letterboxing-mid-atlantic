I was with Ivy on the whirlwind trip of lots of boxes, but sadly my <br/>
knee gave out early on in the day and I spent much time swinging on <br/>
the swings and waiting for him and the others to come waltzing <br/>
back. :) It was a long and windy day, but tons of fun.<br/>
<br/>
Welcome Judy!!! I too am in the Fairfax area. I would be willing to <br/>
meet up and go hunt for a local box or two, and help you 'get your <br/>
feet wet', although I am no expert by any means. :) <br/>
<br/>
Hope everyone is having a superfantastic week! I am looking forward <br/>
to taking some time off and hunting boxes this week, b/c we have very <br/>
little business b/c all the local schools are out. *giggles* So I can <br/>
play hooky and not feel guilty.<br/>

I too am off from work this week due to Spring Break, so I'm <br/>
spending some time up in Rhode Island with my parents. It's great <br/>
Letterboxing country, and I'm quickly getting some "F"s under my <br/>
belt! I haven't even left yet but already I can't wait to return to <br/>
get some more!<br/>
