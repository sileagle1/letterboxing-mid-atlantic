                    <div id="ygrps-yiv-1221393577">Not a great day for boxing. Went hiking on thurs. great day for that, no boxes once again. Was hiking with ladies from my spin class and they were out to work up a sweat. We did the Misey, Joy loop in 1 hour! Good Lord they about killed me! We usualy do loop in 1 1/2 hours. The 2 fastest walkers set off at a very fast clip and the rest of us stuggled to keep up. Glad I had my treking poles.<br/>
Weather enforced confinement just might be the ticket to get boxes ready to plant. Many stamps and many more ideas.....</div>
