Hope I will see some of the locals at Tyler on boxing day. I'm bringing hot drinks and maybe some soup. Don't know what's in the cupboard.<br/>
Hey, Cyclonic what time will you be there? I'll bring some firewood.<br/>

</span></blockquote>Sounds like a nice walk.  Would have liked to have gotten on trail this <br/>
week and photo the snow some, but ended up working and doing other <br/>
things instead :-P<br/>
<br/>
We expect between 8 and 9 in the morning.  I don't think there will be a <br/>
rush for the pavilion.  We are going to breakfast at the Radclif Cafe in <br/>
Bristol before hand, Becky has been wanting to go there.  Have to head <br/>
home Sat. night, work on Sunday :-P again.<br/>
