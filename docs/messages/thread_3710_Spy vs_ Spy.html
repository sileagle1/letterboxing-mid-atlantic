<p class="ygrps-yiv-740853251MsoNormal"><span lang="EN" style="color:black;">Are you a Master Spy<br/>
<br/>
or <br/>
<br/>
will your poor SPY skills get you "caught" or "hung as a
Traitor"?<br/>
<br/>
We shall see . . . . <br/>
<br/>
We shall see . . . <br/>
<br/>
If intrigued and you have a score to settle then come, for a friendly little
game of SPY versus SPY Event.<br/>
<br/>
The GAME: SPY versus SPY<br/>
The Event Date: April 10 of 2010<br/>
Where: Hampton Roads, VA<br/>
<br/>
You, the Spy:<br/>
You are a spy. You steal. You lie. You live in the shadows. You sleep in
“safe houses”. You do all of this in the name of the country that
pays you the most. You are dishonorable. You have no alliances. And you never
know when you’ll breathe your last breath. <br/>
<br/>
Your Mission~ should you choose to accept: Obtain the necessary 5 stamps on
your playing paper. Then make it to your embassy before you get
“Caught” or hung as a “Traitor”.<br/>
<br/>
First Team that makes it’s to their embassy with the 5 stamp images,
before being caught or being hung as a traitor, WINS!<br/>
<br/>
How: These stamps will be hidden in “false” letter boxes
intertwined with real letterboxes. You will be given a list of 18 boxes. 14 of
these boxes will be “real” letterboxes. 4 boxes will be
“false“ boxes. In these false boxes will be four of the needed
stamps for your playing paper. You must CHOOSE WISELY.<br/>
<br/>
5th Stamp? Good question. Glad you are paying attention. The 5th box will be on
the bastardly MOLE. He/She can be anyone . . . ANYONE (maybe even you). To
obtain the 5th stamp you must approach people, giving them the “code
word”. If She/He is the mole, he will give you the stamp. If She/he is
not the mole, I am sure the blank look will be obvious. <br/>
<br/>
Getting CAUGHT or being hung as a TRAITOR: Both of these are bad. Very bad. No
good spy would ever do both. However, somehow, someway, the competition must be
eliminated! Two randomly chosen people at the start of the game will be given
one stamp that reads “caught” and the other a stamp that reads
“traitor”. These stamps will be specially marked and shown before
their release during the game. <br/>
<br/>
Who ever has these stamps in their possession can approach you and guess what
country you are from. They will write down their guess on your paper and sign
their name. If they guess right, they stamp this stamp on your playing paper
and you are officially out of the game. (However, please continue letterboxing,
as this is a letterboxing event, and you mostly definitely can still
letterbox.) If he is wrong, he gives you the stamp and you go your merrily spy
ways. You then take the stamp and approach someone else. You take your guess.
If you are right, they are out. If you are wrong, then you pass the stamp on to
them. And they take it someone else, who approaches someone, and it goes on. <br/>
<br/>
On the playing paper, there will a spot for you to be asked TWICE what country
you are from. So, you have two chances of being knocked out of the game by your
competition. <br/>
<br/>
Country? You will be assigned a country. You will either spy for America,
France, Germany, Italy, Russia, or Spain. Never reveal your country! That will
get you caught or hung as a traitor.<br/>
<br/>
Teams: This is a friendly competition, but a competition no less. Teams can be
1 person to 4 people, as there will only be 4 trophies. You must have a team
name, a team leader, and you must all wear “something” that makes
you a team. Same Yankee hat, same Nancy Drew pin, same T-shirt. Whatever,
it’s up to you. Go Team Spirit! I would encourage teams who are less than
4 to acquire others. That way, more people can participate. <br/>
<br/>
In order to provide the best possible experience, we have purchased many game
items and souvenirs. There is $10.00 fee for each team to cover these expenses
as well as a possible location rental. We are asking that all donations be sent
in by March 1, 2009. Once your team has registered and your fee has been
received, the starting location will be confidentially couriered to you. Read
it quickly as it will self destruct!<br/>
<br/>
Quick, Easy, Painless Rules:<br/>
No cheating! Cheaters will be “hung out to dry” and it won’t
be pretty! <br/>
Don’t remove Lbs or the stamps . . . that’s just like cheating!<br/>
Teams stick together. No splitting, no dividing, no you go that way, I’ll
go that way. United you play, united you fall!<br/>
And teams probably should not have anyone younger than 10 but that's up to you.
You don’t want anyone holding up the team.<br/>
<br/>
TIPS! To Insure Progress~SPIES!!!!!<br/>
Observe everything, presume nothing, trust no one . . . <br/>
A good spy knows details about real people like George Washington, fictional
people like Sherlock Holmes and their personal idols like James Bond. A little
research may get you a box or two. . . . .<br/>
Practice false occupations . . . You never know when a talent may be called
upon and you gotta sing it~ I mean wing it! <br/>
Don’t take getting “Caught” or hung as a
“traitor” personally. It’s a just a game. But you can
continue looking for boxes just the same. And there’s always the
potential of next year . . .<br/>
When it comes to the MOLE Discretion is key here! If you tip off others that
“so and so” is the mole, they will flock to the mole and that
needed stamp! <br/>
• Discretion! Discretion! Discretion!<br/>
<br/>
And the all Essential Potluck:<br/>
Every body will be ask to bring some. Please no arsenic! This a friendly competition.
(Will provide a list for items to bring later.)<br/>

Thank yous.<br/>
<br/>
Accepting this mission:<br/>
<br/>
Unless my enemies get to me first, on Sunday, January 17, I will post this
under the event section of Atlas Quest at 7 pm (EST)! From the moment this
event is posted, we will start accepting team sign ups, via AQ mail. (Do not
sign up on the event page itself.) This is a teams only event. This game is
designed for eleven teams. And no more. <br/>
<br/>
Just for your info, when the west coast version was listed last year, 8 teams
signed up in the first 5 minutes.<br/>
<br/>
When you sign up, you must AQ mail me your team name, team leader and names of
the rest of your team members.* I will list your teams on this event listing
and it will serve as a count off. <br/>
<br/>
First come, first play!<br/>
<br/>
Hesitate and you might not make it . . . . <br/>
• If you don’t want to reveal your team members to the public, I
will place an X instead of their name.. However, as hosts, we reserve the right
to know the names of your members~therefore you must provide them to us.<br/>
<br/>
A <b>BIG</b> thank you to slick kitty for coming to Virginia to co-host this
event with me!</span><span style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Calibri", "sans-serif";color:#1F497D;'></span></p>
