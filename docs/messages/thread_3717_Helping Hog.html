<br/>
For the last couple of weeks, I've been inviting, begging, badgering, cajoling my letterboxing friends to help raise money for Haitian relief. Folks from coast to coast have joined up. Now it's your turn. <br/>
<br/>
I have a personal fundraising page set up at Mercy Corps. These guys are local in the Pacific NW and spend 89% of their money directly on aid projects, not advertising or salaries. It's a bright spot in my day when I see the donation total go up. I know many of you have already opened their hearts and wallets but I'm hoping you might be able to spare a few more bucks for the cause. Pretty please???  <a href="http://www.mercycorps.org/fundraising/funhog" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.mercycorps.org/fundraising/funhog</a><br/>

Our charity money for the month went to a charity called Health Partners( I think that's what it's called). A friend of ours is a Dr. with them, he just got back from Haiti. They need every penny. So if anyone hasn't already donated or has a few more dollars to spend give some support to Funhog.</div><div>MizS</div><div style="font-family:times new roman, new york, times, serif;font-size:12pt;"><br/><div style="padding-left:5px;margin:5px 0px 5px 5px;border-left:#1010ff 2px solid;font-family:times new roman, new york, times, serif;font-size:12pt;"><font face="Tahoma" size="2"><hr size="1"/><b><span style="font-weight:bold;">From:</span></b> funhog1 &lt;funhog1@...&gt;<br/><b><span style="font-weight:bold;">To:</span></b>
