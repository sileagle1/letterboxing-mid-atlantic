<div><font face="Arial" size="2"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">Box #4: The 
Glory of Rome <br/><br/>Go back to the Appian Way and follow it east for 24 steps 
to see another path, the Latin Way, going north, parallel to the utility lines. 
This leads to Rome Point. (If you continued on the Appian way, it ends at a nice 
beach with lovely views of the bay, but we’re not doing that just yet!). Taking 
the Latin Way for almost 400 steps to a pair of four-foot high posts where the 
path goes through a stone wall. Continue another 145 steps to an east-westish T 
intersection. Go east (turn right). After 125 steps, you’ll see the first of 
some obvious paths leading to the top of a tidal slope overlooking one of 
Wickford’s inlets, Bissel Cove and The Narrows. Very pretty! After enjoying that 
side path, go back to the Latin Way. Go down the Latin Way another 150 steps. 
Don't let the view make you forget to count steps! Spy a path going 350* towards 
a very large rock with its feet in the waterline. Take only 3 steps towards that 
rock, stop, and look low to your right, under the cedars. <font color="#ff0080">There, behind one cedar, you’ll not find the letterboxer’s usual 
Suspicious Pile of Rocks (SPOR), but a mixed pile of rocks and branches that 
we’ll call a Suspicious Pile, Quite Rocky (SPQR). Under it lies the Pantheon – 
one of the oldest of the surviving large buildings of Rome.
