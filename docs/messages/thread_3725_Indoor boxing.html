Inside ones tend to be tricky puzzles, but, hey, you're stuck inside anyway.<br/>
<br/>
Since folks were having trouble solving mine, and it really is not something I wanted to hide away for the rare few to find, I did add a link to an answer key.  No one will accidentally see the clues and spoil the quest, but they are online for those who get stumped.<br/>
<br/>
This box was a special attempt to share some of the hand-carved signiture stamps that grace the pages of log books with others who appreciate the effort and those that have stamped in have had my appreciation as well as that of other boxers and noxers.  <br/>
