Just a quick note about BeMa's letterboxes.  <br/>
<br/>
After multiple attempts to reach BeMa by myself and other <br/>
letterboxers, I'm adopting these boxes.  If BeMa comes back for them, <br/>
great!  If not, I want to keep them alive.  All of them are fun and <br/>
it would be a shame to lose them.<br/>
<br/>
BeMa will continue to be listed as the originator.<br/>
<br/>
I've been to all of the letterbox sites in August, and 5 of them are <br/>
still standing, although some need work.  "Oh Deer!" is in sad shape, <br/>
but the park is spectacular and worth the $4 to get in.<br/>
<br/>
These have all been listed as MIA, for now:<br/>
<br/>
Helping Hands<br/>
Curtain Up!<br/>
The Mole<br/>
<br/>
In keeping with the spirit of the originals, does anyone have images <br/>
of these so that I could roughly replace the stamps?  If so, please <br/>
contact me offlist so I can get photocopies or electronic images.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks,<br/>
