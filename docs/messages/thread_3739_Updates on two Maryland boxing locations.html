Those considering the Columbia Petroglyphs series might want to hold off for a while. Storm sewer construction along the entire length of the trail has destroyed the locations of several of the boxes, which have been pulled for safekeeping. When construction is complete (probably some time in 2011) the boxes will be replanted in modified locations. Until then, only boxes 4 and 6 of this series are in place.</div>
