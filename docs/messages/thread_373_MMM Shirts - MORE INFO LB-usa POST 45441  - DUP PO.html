So many questions! I'll try to answer them all.<br/>
<br/>
There will be no white shirts! I would like to do a dark color but I <br/>
don't know<br/>
how well the image will show up on them. Gray might be the finall <br/>
choice.<br/>
<br/>
Sizes: Adult small to I believe 2 or 3x. I would say go with your <br/>
regular size.<br/>
<br/>
The t-shirts are short sleeved and the sweatshirts are long sleeved.<br/>
<br/>
I suppose I can do kids sizes, I don't know how those run, maybe <br/>
order a size up<br/>
so they last longer! Those kids have a way of growing as soon as you <br/>
buy them<br/>
something new!!<br/>
<br/>
NO I will not be posting an image of the design online. The image on <br/>
the shirt<br/>
is a full color imprint of the event stamp and will be kept secret <br/>
until Oct.<br/>
2nd. I suppose if you really don't want to take a chance in advance <br/>
you can pay<br/>
the extra $5.00 and I can make you one after the event and mail it to <br/>
you!<br/>
Trust me, you'll like it!<br/>
<br/>
For everyone who has contacted me already I will reply back to you in <br/>
the next<br/>
day or two.<br/>
<br/>
Have a great weekend, should be perfect for boxing, at least in New <br/>
England!<br/>
