                    <div id="ygrps-yiv-468158154">Mystery boxes. Love 'em, hate 'em. Spent the morning and afternoon with Geraina. We had the right tree, not sure of other angle but swore we were in the right area, in fact we were in the right area in fact we walked right by box, many times.<br/>
Took a break to look for another box, no luck. Planted one. Took one more crack at 1st box. Left, got a late lunch. While at sub shop tech support called. Yes. we had been in right area. Geraina guilted me in to going back for one more try. 10, 15 min max she promised. We parked and walked right to box with no hesitation.<br/>
Thanks, Geraina, glad we went back.</div>

                    <div id="ygrps-yiv-4198743">Yeah! Glad you guys found it. Must have had top level tech support. I should turn that little gizmo on some times. Just checked it and had a message from back in February! (Sorry Sheba that we missed that call!)  Maybe I'll just email you my work number instead....<br/>
