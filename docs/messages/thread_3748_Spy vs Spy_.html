<br/>
It was a great event . . .  Casa Del Sol and Slick Kitty did a great job... everybody had fun... fantastic fun theme... mant twists and turns... straategy speculation sessions . . . who's the mole? who has the power to knock who out...  dozens of letterboxes to find.... the finder of the special five stamps won...  The MadHatters ... four local lady letterboxers blindsided us....  (YankeeChik,X,Bobguyman and I teamed up to form Rogue eXiles) we thought we were front running... but were at least 45 minutes behind the winners. But the weather was perfect... the food was good... wish you and Martini Man were there!<br/>
<br/>
Concratulations to Slick Kitty for bringing this concept East... and conratulations to Casa del Sol for a super smooth event.... and concratulations to the Madhatters...  who were by far the best Spy Team today!  (Wait till next year!)</div>

<br/>
I think at one point Otis had a "capture" stamp -- but he didn't show it to us, instead we traded our freedom for a box location! It is possible he didn't have the stamp at all and con'd us out of a hint!!<br/>
<br/>
Cyclonic, Schizokeet and moi were team Serendipity.<br/>
<br/>
Some of the Special Agents could be bought for something red, or pink, or whatever the pre-game email hints might have been and then you would get a hint . . . alas it cost me a pink hi-liter and a purple felt stamp pouch but I failed to understand their hints!<br/>
<br/>
There were clues that need to be decoded, albeit easy codes, but time consuming.<br/>
<br/>
Of the 20 stamps planted, you had to find 4 and the mole/stamp to win.  So fleet of feet and mind were paramount.<br/>
<br/>
Are you going to the Reno SvS in June??  I don't think, I've told you anything really helpful ;^)<br/>

<p style="margin-bottom:12.0pt;">As it turned member of team eXiles (GR, X, son
Bobgnyman &amp; Yankee Chick) was the mole. But even that didn't spur them to
the lead!<br/>
<br/>
I think at one point Otis had a "capture" stamp -- but he didn't show
it to us, instead we traded our freedom for a box location! It is possible he
didn't have the stamp at all and con'd us out of a hint!!<br/>
<br/>
Cyclonic, Schizokeet and moi were team Serendipity.<br/>
<br/>
Some of the Special Agents could be bought for something red, or pink, or
whatever the pre-game email hints might have been and then you would get a hint
. . . alas it cost me a pink hi-liter and a purple felt stamp pouch but I
failed to understand their hints!<br/>
<br/>
There were clues that need to be decoded, albeit easy codes, but time
consuming.<br/>
<br/>
Of the 20 stamps planted, you had to find 4 and the mole/stamp to win. So fleet
of feet and mind were paramount.<br/>
<br/>
Are you going to the Reno SvS in June?? I don't think, I've told you anything
really helpful ;^)<br/>
