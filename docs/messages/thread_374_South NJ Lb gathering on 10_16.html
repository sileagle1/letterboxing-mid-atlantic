I see.  If a private invite you have to enter e-ddresses -- not <br/>
practical.  If a public invite, you have to be registered to access <br/>
the public invitations.  From the LB-usa chat about registering for <br/>
LB.org clues I doubt that would be practical either.  <br/>

But for my own personal use with personal friends -- thanks for the <br/>

If it is only the list owner who can download e-ddress, does that <br/>
mean only the owner can issue the invite (seems logical)?<br/>
I ask because the owner is not usually the one host/essing the <br/>
gather.  <br/>
BUT can anyone invited go in and see the responses (i.e. the <br/>
host/ess).  IF yes, (even if requiring registration) this is <br/>
convienent.<br/>
<br/>
Since Fleurdelis is the owner and is currently unpacking boxes (or is <br/>
she still packing?) I would ask you to email her directly to discuss <br/>
this ---  but please give her a few more weeks to get it together.<br/>
<br/>
Meanwhile I can try it out with the Red-Hat Box'rs --- after I finish <br/>
travelin' <br/>
<br/>
Have you posted this to the LB-usa so other regional lists can take <br/>
advantage?<br/>

evites. they are quite simple to send and you do not have to register <br/>
on the site to receive one. i belong to a local running club and have <br/>
sent evites to our members (400+) w/o any problems. of course i am <br/>
the membership director so i have access to everyone's email addy.<br/>
the lbma news group only lists 137 members so it would be an easy <br/>
fit. alas, no email address no evites. i did look at the members list <br/>
of this newsgroup and only a truncated address is displayed.<br/>
a solution would be to have the owner make available a list of <br/>
members email address or send post a message requesting such.<br/>

it was just a thought to use evite.com for the NJ gathering. <br/>
