                    <div id="ygrps-yiv-2039724967">I just discovered that I had the picture for the 47 53 71 23 41 73 67 Letterbox on AQ set as decorative. This didn't allow for the picture to be enlarged making the puzzle nearly impossible to solve. The clue is fixed now for anyone who is interested. This is the first letterboxing activity I've done in over a month as I am eyeball deep in a bedroom renovation. I can see the light at the end of the tunnel now(just hope it's not just a train).<br/>
