                    <div id="ygrps-yiv-1855549025">Had a lovely hike this week-end with my hubby. Decided to check up on one of my favorite boxes in Ridley crrek, Early american farm. Stumbled over clues but mananged to find spot. Box was gone. A few yards away was a log, great place to sit and log in, surrounded by crumpled beer cans and 2 very suspicious flat rocks.<br/>
If someone sat there long enough to create the pile of cans and had such a nice view of suspicious rocks... well you get the picture. We sat on convenient log had a nice lunch and thought about waht to do.<br/>
Placer no longer boxes, has anyone heard from Hexacat or Trax?<br/>
I could re-carve and replace, but think it would go missing the same way.<br/>
I could re-carve, write new clue(early american farmville). I'm thinking it would come up right under current box listing on LBNA. Have my clue refer to original box,  and then take finder to another tree not far away. I found a great tree for this, and have already thought of clever clue.<br/>
We cleaned up all the beer cans and Jamie's pack is airing on the back porch.<br/>
