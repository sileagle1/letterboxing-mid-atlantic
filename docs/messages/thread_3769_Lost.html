As for the rest of it, I have heard that the writers themselves couldn't figure out how to explain some of their mysteries in a congruent fashion.  That is why there are some things that never got settled.  Some of the characters were probably just flavor and "red shirts"  to be sacrificed to plot development.  Jack evidentally wasn't supposed to survive the pilot, so a lot of things evolved over the course of the show.  <br/>

<p>Well then, the BIG question for me is...in the final episode - they made it 
  look like no one survived the plane crash.  In that final shot, when you 
  see the plane crashed on the beach with clothing strewn everywhere - the plane 
  crashes...everyone dies....the whole six years are spent by the dead people 
  trying to figure out that they are dead.  So how does Walt get taken 
  home?  Is the crash really found?  Is Walt then found?
  <div><br/></div>
<div>Or did they all survive the initial plane crash, the island stuff was all 
  real, and then they were picked off one by one, and then still had to realize 
  they were dead?</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>Oh, I'm so confused!!  I prefer the first answer.</div>

<p><br/>Several of these questions were actually answered. i saw every 
    episode, but have no idea what season they were in.<br/>- The numbers were 
    the numbers assigned to the candidates who survived.<br/>- They did show the 
    significance of all the people on the island.<br/>- They never explained the 
    baby problem. My guess would be that it had something to do with the 
    electromagnetic properties.<br/>- The reason Walt didn't come back is simple, 
    he grew too much. They actually discussed it on the Jimmy Kimmel Live 
    episode that followed. He made it back to the US and was living with his 
    grandmother.<br/>- The Black Rock was the slave ship that brought Richard to 
    the island. I don't think they ever said why it was loaded with 
    dynamite.<br/>- Charles Widmore was the leader of the others who was kicked 
    off the Island when Ben took over.<br/><br/>As for the rest of it, I have 
    heard that the writers themselves couldn't figure out how to explain some of 
    their mysteries in a congruent fashion. That is why there are some things 
    that never got settled. Some of the characters were probably just flavor and
