Today I am posting to let you know that last night Dude the Wonder Dog was put to rest. He was 19 and hadn't been feeling that great the last month or so. My son called me at work to tell me to come home. I took him to the vet and they said it was time to let him go. I stayed with my boy while he went to sleep and they let me sit with him for a long time afterwards. For those of you who didn't know him, Dude was the best damn dog in the whole wide world and the whole reason I got into letterboxing. As his health declined we didn't go out too much. Besides letterboxing Dude was an avid camper, caver and a huge fan of McDonald's french fries. He and I hiked two of the highest paeks in West Virgina togther and have had so many adventures that I will cherish forever. To those of you who DID know him I thank you from the bottom of my heart for your kindess to him. To everyone who welcomed him into your home, you cars, your tents, who always asked how he was doing if I was at an event he couldn't attend. I thank you and Dude thanks you. Dude was 19 and my best friend in the entire world and I am just heartbroken. But I am so grateful we found each other and had so many great adventures together. This is the end of Hikers &amp; Hounds. I will plant our team stamp somewhere but without Dude there is no Hikers &amp; Hounds. I thank you and miss you all.

Becky and I are so very saddened to hear of you losing Dude.  He meant <br/>
so very much to you as well as everyone else who's life he touched.  He <br/>
will be very much missed.  Alas, all good things must come to an end, <br/>
and while you are saddened to lose him, you must remember that he is in <br/>
a far better place, a place where he is free to roam where he wishes, <br/>
with lots of things to chew up and butts to sniff.<br/>
<br/>
We love you Irene, and you are in our thoughts,<br/>

Your and our spirits will always be lifted by memories of his positive dude-ishness.<br/>

&gt; Hello to old friends, it's be awhile since I've posted but life has been happening and my old boys arthiritis made it tough for him to hike anymore. Today I am posting to let you know that last night Dude the Wonder Dog was put to rest. He was 19 and hadn't been feeling that great the last month or so. My son called me at work to tell me to come home. I took him to the vet and they said it was time to let him go. I stayed with my boy while he went to sleep and they let me sit with him for a long time afterwards. For those of you who didn't know him, Dude was the best damn dog in the whole wide world and the whole reason I got into letterboxing. As his health declined we didn't go out too much. Besides letterboxing Dude was an avid camper, caver and a huge fan of McDonald's french fries. He and I hiked two of the highest paeks in West Virgina togther and have had so many adventures that I will cherish forever. To those of you who DID know him I thank you from the bottom of my heart for your kindess to him. To everyone who welcomed him into your home, you cars, your tents, who always asked how he was doing if I was at an event he couldn't attend. I thank you and Dude thanks you. Dude was 19 and my best friend in the entire world and I am just heartbroken. But I am so grateful we found each other and had so many great adventures together. This is the end of Hikers &amp; Hounds. I will plant our team stamp somewhere but without Dude there is no Hikers &amp; Hounds. I thank you and miss you all.

I've taken him before on a leash and today I let him off-leash but was afraid he'd run off into the mud or somebody's backyard but he stayed pretty close and came when called, so thank you Dude.<br/>
