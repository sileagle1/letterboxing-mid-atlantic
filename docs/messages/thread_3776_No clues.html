                    <div id="ygrps-yiv-704894686">So before I left home I printed out 3 clues for boxes in Guatemala. They are on my kitchen counter. But before I left I showed them to my daughter who was here last year. One she said was too far one was on the volcano that just erupted and one was in a really bad part of town(with a comercial stamp to boot). So i guess no boxes for me.<br/>
