&gt; &gt; It is a fantastic looking day outside, but I am home packing up for some <br/>
&gt; &gt; coasters and camping in Western PA this coming week.  Hope to get some <br/>
&gt; &gt; boxing done as well, there are a few things that have peaked my interest <br/>
&gt; &gt; out there :-)<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Well, not this weekend, but Wednesday and Thursday, the 4 Spigs (soon to be BlueDelft), and I boxed Ridley Park in PA... We are newer to letterboxing, and this park is literally in my back yard. We planned to box it together but the timing was always wrong. The planets all aligned, we had fab weather. The letterboxer gods shined on us.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; So many amazing boxes there! We were especially stoked to find all 4 boxes in RedHatBxr's "Color Me Red".  There were boxes in that series that were marked "attempted" 7 times, last logged in 2007! <br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Many thanks to those who planted, many of which post here! Amazing!<br/>

</span></blockquote>Congrats to you, the way those women write clues, it is a wonder anyone <br/>
finds their boxes.  I think it has something to due with the drunkiness <br/>
while planting ;-)<br/>
<br/>
While in Western PA last week we found but three boxes (actually, just <br/>
one in PA, the others were in NY).  I will say, reading the clues for <br/>
boxes more recently planted in the Altoona area has me salivating for a <br/>
return, and the one, "Red Arrow Train Wreck," we did find there was <br/>
outstanding.  We just did not have the time, what with all the roller <br/>
coaster hopping and get soaked by some gigantic waterfall (10,000 <br/>
gallons a second will do that).  We did, however, find the time to plant <br/>
on a nice five mile hike, clues to follow.<br/>
<br/>
Oh, did I mention Texas?  It was a great trip as well, and we did find a <br/>
few more boxes down there, including one that had not been found in <br/>
sometime and with many attempts on it.  Seems those Texans just are not <br/>
persistent enough.  Fortunately, Schizokeet is.  I planted there as <br/>
well, this time with a cuckoo clue.  Figure I will keep those Texans on <br/>
their toes.<br/>
<br/>
We met with Maiden and company last night as well.  Great group of <br/>
folks.  Many thanks to X for scouting out and finding a much, much <br/>
better location for a dozen folks for dinner.  The original plan, Johnny <br/>
Rockets, was far too small, and then I commented that we could not do <br/>
the meet in the food court as we had been kicked out of there a few <br/>
years ago, besides, it was very, very crowded.  Siné was a great choice.<br/>
<br/>
I think that is all for now, I hear a Lager (it has a first name, or so <br/>
I've heard) calling my name.<br/>
