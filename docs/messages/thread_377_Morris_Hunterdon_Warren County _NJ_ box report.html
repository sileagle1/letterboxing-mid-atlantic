<br/>
Merrill Creek<br/>
Charmed for Sure<br/>
Ken Lockwood<br/>
Fisherman's Point<br/>
<br/>
There were a few issues with boxes being rehidden and/or repackaged <br/>
well (a couple of the boxes were quite wet), but I cleaned them up as <br/>
best I could and rebagged where needed.  Merrill Creek was beautiful <br/>
with the sun shining wonderfully on the reservoir.<br/>
<br/>
Ken Lockwood was beautiful; my advice is to walk it and not try to <br/>
drive by.  The drive had me gripping the wheel, and I completely <br/>
missed the tretsle.  That's right, I drove under a trestle and didn't <br/>
notice.  I got out and walked back when I got to the end and realized <br/>
what I had done (Silent Doug can attest that I was a little, um, <br/>
annoyed with myself), and it was much more enjoyable that way, anyway.<br/>
<br/>
On 9/12, Silent Doug and I found:<br/>
<br/>
Jockey Hollow<br/>
Physiography 102<br/>
Huts<br/>
<br/>
The Huts stamp is awesome, really!</div>
