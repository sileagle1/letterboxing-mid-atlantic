At least it CAN if you visit my Philly LiveStrong 2010 letterbox!  For the 3rd year in a row, I'm riding in the Philly LiveStrong ride to benefit the Lance Armstrong Foundation.  As part of my fundraising efforts, I have carved and planted 2 letterboxes in eastern PA.  The stipulation is that in order to get the clues, you must make a small donation to my fundrasing page.  You can donate as little as $5 online.  Of course more is welcome. :)  We're in the last month of fundraising and I'm trying to make a push now.  All the details and links are at both Atlasquest.com and letterboxing.org.  Click the clue link for my Philly Livestrong 2010 letterbox.  And the carves aren't too shabby either. ;)<br/>
<br/>
I'm sure that each and every one of us has be affected directly or indirectly by this awful disease.  Please join me in helping to find a cure and assist those currently fighting the battle against cancer!<br/>
<br/>
Thank you!<br/>
