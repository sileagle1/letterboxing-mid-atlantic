<br/>
The Brewery tour is awesome, a must do.  Try and catch a weekday tour, <br/>
even better, the early tour, as it is not as crowded and they are in <br/>
full operation so you get to see everything at work.<br/>
<br/>
I, sadly, cannot suggest any boxes, as when we were out there a few <br/>
weeks ago we were busy doing other things and found not Western PA boxes.<br/>
<br/>
I can, however, suggest amusement parks, as we visited all of them :-)<br/>
<br/>
Idlewild and Kennywood are fantastic parks, well run with great rides.  <br/>
I would also recommend Conneaut Lake Park, which is nearest to Slippery <br/>
Rock.  The park is run down and seen better days, but they are trying to <br/>
rebuild it as best they can.  It has a few classic rides and a staff <br/>
that really cares about the park, along with a great bar :-)<br/>
