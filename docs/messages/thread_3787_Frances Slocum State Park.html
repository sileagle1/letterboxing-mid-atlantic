&gt; For those of you who haven't heard, all trail blazes of all colors at this state <br/>
&gt; park west of Joe Biden's hometown have apparently been painted over with road <br/>
&gt; paint yellow.  However, a preliminary investigation has shown that at least some <br/>
&gt; letterboxes in the park are still very findable.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Now for an anecdote that is an actual experience and not a clue.  We had just <br/>
&gt; finished covering up a box last weekend and were walking back to the trail when <br/>
&gt; we saw a middle-aged couple leaving the trail and heading toward the general <br/>
&gt; area where we had been.  As I walked down the trail, I started wondering if they <br/>
&gt; were potential muggles or other letterboxers looking for the box.  In the <br/>
&gt; interest of protecting the box and/or getting an exchange, I turned around and <br/>
&gt; headed back.  My vision is not that good and we were some distance away, but <br/>
&gt; they didn't appear to be all that interested in the letterbox.  Further <br/>
&gt; embarrassment was avoided when they walked behind a large rock formation.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Some minutes later, as I was stamping in/first aiding another box further down <br/>
&gt; the trail, I heard an ATV driving down the other side of the rock formation, <br/>
&gt; playing loud music.  (Think something along the lines of what you would expect <br/>
&gt; the Xtreeeme! sports enthusiasts to listen to in Harold and Kumar Go to White <br/>
&gt; Castle, rather than what was actually in the tape deck.)  Later still, when we <br/>
&gt; returned to the parking lot, we saw flashing lights and a ranger writing a <br/>
&gt; ticket.  And there they were.  As we were leaving the park, saw a black and <br/>
&gt; white heading toward the parking lot.<br/>
