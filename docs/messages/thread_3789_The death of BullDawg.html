First I want to apologize for the lack of communication with me lately.  I have just got back online, and have been overwhelmed with emails to catch up on.  I hope this post serves as an email to 'all' in a way.  I really want to apologize to those that signed up for SummerSlamII.  I had some VERY serious personal issues that prevented me from pulling this off, or even getting online.  I can't go into details, as there is not enough time or energy left in my body for that.....Maybe in the coming years I will recover enough to get the energy up, to do this local event justice.  I especially apologize to the out-of-towners whom had planned to come, as well as my local pub crawl friends and vets.....Sometimes, serious issues arrise that prevent me from the simple pleasures I enjoy so much.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
On another note, and this kinda seals the deal on my last month:<br/>
<br/>
My name is BullDawg, because I love the Browns, and the breed of bulldogs.  To me there is no other breed of animal for me, even though I love all dogs.  When I started this hobby, I searched for a name, and the one I found just fit me.  Last night, or early this morning, I awoke to find that my baby, my bulldog of 10 years had passed....Maybe one of the hardest days of my life and the hardest things to ever walk into unexpectedly.  The heartbreak of this has no words.  Since my baby, 'Penny' has passed, I feel that my trailname has officially passed.  I'm sure I will surface again....I am not sure when, or with what name....all that I know is that when she passed today, a part of me left with her.....and my feeling at this time is the trailname just doesnt work anymore.<br/>
<br/>
That being said, I must mention. 'Dude'...Hikers-n-hounds has recently gone through the same 'loss', and I have known her and her GREAT friend.  There really is no UNCONDITIONAL love than the love a dog and its owner have for each other.  <br/>
<br/>
I will always miss my 'lil girl', and thanks for your understanding with all my personal issues the past month.<br/>
