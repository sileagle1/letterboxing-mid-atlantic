We're in NY right now, closer than usual to PA, but a bit too far to pay a visit.  Perhaps we'll be closer next year and hopefully get a chance to meet Casey.<br/>

&gt; <br/>
&gt; Â  <br/>
&gt; Well, it's been almost 3 months now since Dude passed and I have a new trail <br/>
&gt; buddy, Casey. So I guess I am ready to plant Dude and my sig stamp, Hikers &amp; <br/>
&gt; Hounds. I always said I would plant it in the exact spot where Dude stumbled <br/>
&gt; upon our first box while out hiking Jan '04. That box was muggled long ago, and <br/>
&gt; I'll make sure I hide it really well, but I think it's time. Plus, Casey and I <br/>
&gt; have been together 2 weeks now, she's great on and off leash so it's time to get <br/>
&gt; her out on trail. I came up with a really cute sig stamp for her that I'll carve <br/>
&gt; and she might decide to plant a box on Friday as well. We'll see.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Hope everyone has a happy and healthy holiday weekend. Box Softy.<br/>

<div>Thanks! It's nice to be missed! I was absent so long due to family issues 
  and Dude got so old hiking really wasn't good for him. SO I spent the last two 
  years inside with my old boy and attending the occasional gather. But now I 
  have a great little girl, about  a year old, named Casey and I'm ready to 
  get back out there and Casey seems pretty excited to learn about boxing. Will 
  be taking it slow in the heat but going full out fall and winter. Thanks 
  again!</div>

Glad to hear you have a new friend. Grateful Dawg and I plan to put some new plants in the area so when we get together in cooler weather there will be some new boxes for you at Tyler and nearby. Casey mentioned to me that while she's name after a Grateful Dead song she also loves classical music and would like to so a series of classical composers, Beethoven of course being her favorite. So we'll get working on that soon. I think there's still a few nooks and crannies left in Tyler for new boxes and then yes, LB, there will be a December gather. <br/></div>

&gt; Hey, hey Irene! It's great to hear that you have a new pal. Will you be posting <br/>
&gt; a photo of her so we can see what she looks like? How old is she?<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; We're in NY right now, closer than usual to PA, but a bit too far to pay a <br/>
&gt; visit. Perhaps we'll be closer next year and hopefully get a chance to meet <br/>
&gt; Casey.<br/>
