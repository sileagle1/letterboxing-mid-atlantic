I'm going to keep my eyes peeled for that Mystery Box in DE.  Athough <br/>
in the 40+ years I've been going down there I don't ever recall <br/>
seeing it...wasn't looking then.<br/>
<br/>
Went by Michael's Crafts and they have 25% off the Strathmore sketch <br/>
books -- you can skip the one in PanAM Shop Ctr, Fairfax VA -- I <br/>
bought the last four.<br/>
<br/>
And are the hand carved stamps in the boxes really made out of those <br/>
tiny (1"x2") pink rubber erasers?  I got a red ink pad just to <br/>
camouflage the blood stains.<br/>
<br/>
Looking forward to my first find.  And have been spreading the word <br/>
of this activity . . . Even told the fella at Hudson Trail Outfitters <br/>
about it and that they need to have a display for holding clues.  He <br/>
sound really interested and I'll be back to follow up with him about <br/>
such a display (when I hide my first letterbox).<br/>
<br/>
It is a full moon so I know I am ramblin'<br/>

vacationing), so I assume it's okay. After all, there are no rules :)<br/>

that were very nicely carved on erasers. Whatever works.. :)<br/>

than any hobby is worth. No reason to try again.<br/>
<br/>
My signature stamp is store bought. The "stamps" in some of my boxes are<br/>
labels with photos or other artwork (usually relevant to the area) on them.<br/>
That's as close to art as I'm ever going to get. The only other option is<br/>
for me to plant other people's stamps, and I've been lucky enough to get to<br/>
do that a couple times. Actually, I could plant a store bought stamp too,<br/>
but I prefer to put an original creation of some sort out there.<br/>
<br/>
I see nothing wrong with getting started by just signing in the log book,<br/>
with no obligation to return with a stamp. Just get out there and have fun.<br/>
