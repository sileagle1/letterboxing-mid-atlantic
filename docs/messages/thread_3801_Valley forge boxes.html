  <br/><br/>I would leave them be. When the park does pull them, which will

</span></blockquote>I had thought about that, but really I see them as a red herring.  They <br/>
are very obviously there and the park would have no trouble finding <br/>
them.  Once done, they would likely think they got everything and not <br/>
notice the boxes slipping in under the radar.  That is what has happened <br/>
at Gettysburg.<br/>
