&gt; You walked into the gather<br/>
&gt; Like you were walking onto a yacht<br/>
&gt; Your hat strategically dipped below one eye<br/>
&gt; Your snack was dried apricot<br/>
&gt; You had one eye on the mirror as<br/>

&gt; Well, you said that you left such a pretty SPOR<br/>
&gt; And that it would never cleave<br/>
