Some folks found that box on 9/26 and, it seems, left it the open.  I can't figure out how to include the picture here but maybe I will post it in the photos section.<br/>

At the time, we did not know that I would be back on 10/7.  If we had checked the box on 9/26 I would not have looked when I came back, and if we had checked before the last finders then that box would probably have sat in the open for awhile.<br/>

When you find a box, please put it back where the clue says that it should be or, if you can't, then hide it safely nearby and tell the placer what happened.<br/>

<br/>
Mostly, I think that this story has a happy ending that doesn't entail the mysterious disappearance of a box and the dreaded recarve/surrender decision.<br/>
