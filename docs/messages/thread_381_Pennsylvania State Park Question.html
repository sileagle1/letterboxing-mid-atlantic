Boy are you preaching to the choir here! I respect what MaryAnn says <br/>
and doubt she is one of those referenced in another email <br/>
as "Arrongant Equestrians" or something like that. But I met one <br/>
this weekend!On Sunday Dude and I were way the heck back on trail <br/>
and I had him off leash, which I know is bad but he doesn't leave my <br/>
side except to protect us both from the dangerous squirrels, which <br/>
he never catchs. He just enjoys running and barking at them, then he <br/>
comes right back. Anyway, Dude and I were sitting in a remote field <br/>
stamping into a box when out of the woods comes a horse. I had to <br/>
quick get him on leash in  case he decided to wander up and say hi <br/>
to the horse. I didn't him to want to spook it. Well the rider gave <br/>
me a talking to about him being off leash. I explained to her that I <br/>
dod keep him on leash most of the time and this was the exception, <br/>
however I did not see any horse signs posted on any of the trails so <br/>
I assumed horses were not allowed in the park. Her response <br/>
was "well, they never said we can't be here" I explained that I <br/>
carefully read all signs with regard to horses, bikes, and dogs so I <br/>
know what to expect. I saw dogs signs everywhere asking owners to <br/>
clean up, which I do. So right then her horse takes a huge dump and <br/>
Dude and I are staring at here. So I told her I had lot's of paper <br/>
towels and zip locks so she could clean that up. She laughed and <br/>
said no one expects horse owners to do that! So Dude and I just <br/>
walked away from her in disgust and I was really thinking about <br/>
contacting park management about it.<br/>
Another one of my pet peeves are the canadian geese. People feed <br/>
these pests so that they have given up their natural migratory <br/>
behavior and many are now year round park residents where they crap <br/>
everywhere and severely fowl the local waters. And I show up with <br/>
Dude, who loves to bark at them, and get dirty looks from <br/>
the "enablers" feeding these year round loafers. I actually had a <br/>
confrontatin with an elderly person who said I should now have my <br/>
dog at Pennypack Park, Pine Road entrance, if he is going to bark at <br/>
the geese. I explained to her that he is just barking and that at <br/>
least I clean up after him. I asked to look around where she was <br/>
standing, it was disgusting! And the little creek there is getting <br/>
so gross!<br/>
<br/>
Well, enough ranting for me. It's not safe for a woman of my <br/>
advanced years to get so worked up this late at night!<br/>
<br/>
I don't know Nat, I don't think there is an answer for you but I'll <br/>
see if I can get one.<br/>

At the beach it's the sea gulls.  When we were in<br/>
Yellowstone last year      the rangers have a saying "<br/>
A fed bear is a dead bear".  We then applied this to<br/>
all the wild animals out there. It was amazing to<br/>
watch parents oohh and ahh over how cute it was when<br/>
the kids fed the chipmunks potato chips. Anyway trail<br/>
use. I think we all need to be aware of the rules for<br/>
multi use trails so they can stay that way. One of the<br/>
trails I use for ridding is maintained by a "hunt" for<br/>
equestrian use but they also allow walkers with dogs. <br/>
As a rider I have had several close calls with<br/>
mountain bikers.  Both bikes and horses can do a lot<br/>
of damage to trails not meant for their use.<br/>

warning signs at water's edge in the parks. There is only one area <br/>
designated where feeding is allowed. But since the geese graze, and <br/>
there's a lot of lawn, we're not getting that far. But if you should <br/>
find a feeder, you can turn them in.<br/>
