I plan on replanting when the mayhem is over with but I may have to modify the clues. So if you have already printed the clues off your gonna want to check the online clue page before you head out to check the status.<br/>
<br/>
The good news is that I recarved "Did I Do That" and went out on sat to replant. I was not able to replant though as there was not enough room under the rock for two boxes. The original is still safe and sound in it's hiding place. Now I do have a quick back up if the box ever does go missing. I did modify the clue slightly, it turns out the first tree used as a landmark (one with the large tumor) was not a beech tree.<br/>
