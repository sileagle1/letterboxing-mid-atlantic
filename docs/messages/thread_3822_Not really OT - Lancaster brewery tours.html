Stoudt's makes really good beer.  I love the Fat Dog oatmeal stout - with coffee notes in the beer, it's like breakfast in a bottle.<br/>

As for the tour, well, nothing wrong with breaking a 500 year-old German food purity law, the Reinheitsgebot, unless you keep yapping about how the brewery still obeys the law.  Oatmeal would be verboten under the Reinheitsgebot.<br/>

Seems like the Stoudts are merchants who happen to make beer, rather than beer geex who sell what they can't drink - doesn't make them wrong but it leads to stuff like the cheesy simulated German village of shops out back.<br/>

On the other hand, if we were in Lancaster then I'd probably be a regular at Lancaster Brewing...<br/>

</span></blockquote>Never have gotten over the Stoudt's, but Lancaster Brewery is top notch, <br/>
and some good brews as well, though their restaurant is only OK.<br/>
<br/>
We did the tour of Troeg's a few years back as well, interesting, and <br/>
some neat stuff in their tasting room.  Our most recent tour was of <br/>
Williamsburg Alewerks.  Very small operation that sells almost entirely <br/>
local, but they too have some outstanding brews.<br/>
<br/>
Think I need a beer now :-)<br/>

Downtown Lancaster is dead on a Sunday, which would cut some options - nice to get to the farmer's market - but also be better for boxes planted in places that normally draw a lot of traffic.<br/>
<br/>
Haven't yet been to the Iron Hill in Lancaster but if they have a room for private groups, that would be cool - Lancaster Brewing doesn't.<br/>

&gt; Maybe we need to do a Lancaster area event.....<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Just thinking....<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; There is also an Iron Hill Brewery that just did a special beer for St James Church.<br/>

&gt; &gt; Evilmommy has a box very close to Stoudt's - the only box that we tried to get - good box to seek at this time of year.<br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; Stoudt's makes really good beer.  I love the Fat Dog oatmeal stout - with coffee notes in the beer, it's like breakfast in a bottle.<br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; As for the tour, well, nothing wrong with breaking a 500 year-old German food purity law, the Reinheitsgebot, unless you keep yapping about how the brewery still obeys the law.  Oatmeal would be verboten under the Reinheitsgebot.<br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; Seems like the Stoudts are merchants who happen to make beer, rather than beer geex who sell what they can't drink - doesn't make them wrong but it leads to stuff like the cheesy simulated German village of shops out back.<br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; On the other hand, if we were in Lancaster then I'd probably be a regular at Lancaster Brewing...<br/>

&gt; &gt; &gt; I liked LBC when I was there with Cyclonic &amp; Schizokeet. Never been to Stoudts but it's a very carveable logo.... I noticed that there are quite a few boxes that I haven't found in the greater Lancaster area (not near the breweries tho, I think). Should probably plan a trip out that way in the near future!<br/>

&gt; &gt; &gt; We toured Lancaster Brewing Company and Stoudt's Brewing Company today.  Lancaster gives you a fast, cool little tour - Syner and I were the whole group - nice restaurant, too.<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; As for Stoudt's, well, it's a good brewery but the tour was awful.<br/>
