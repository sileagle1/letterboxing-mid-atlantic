take a little walk in the Shenandoah.<br/>
<br/>
It was just a short 2.5 mile hike up to Mary's Rock, where we did not <br/>
stay too long on account of the wind blowing heavily off the western <br/>
side of the ridge.  It was a very nice day out though, and worth it.<br/>
<br/>
On the way back we managed to find a few boxes.  An old box, Old Man <br/>
Winter, was still found in fine shape near Sperryville, VA.  It was just <br/>
a short walk, but since being planted five years ago, has had very few <br/>
finders.  The first finders (who reside on this list) didn't find it <br/>
until two years after it was planted.<br/>
<br/>
A new box was planted just last week at the Narmada winery, which is <br/>
fairly new in it's own right.  So a quick, cold find followed by a <br/>
tasting and fire to warm up.<br/>
<br/>
Not a bad short day, and we were home for lunch.<br/>
<br/>
Oh, and I planted a box that I have been planning for a year now to <br/>
plant, clues forthcoming.<br/>

<br/>
It was pretty cold in Nashville, too. We did have a great hike this AM north of town, however and found a bunch of boxes planted in 2006 that have held up very well.<br/>
<br/>
We remember the Old Man Winter box. We found it in 2007. Nice carve by an incredible boxer who has since left the game regrettably. He did some REALLY nice stuff.<br/>
