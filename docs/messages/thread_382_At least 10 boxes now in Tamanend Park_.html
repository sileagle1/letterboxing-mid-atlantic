<div> </div>
<div>I have been trying to get this done since June I think? After months of discussion Tony the Park Director at Tamanend gave me permission to plant there. Saturday I had a letterboxing booth at "Tamanend Park Day" which went okay but there was so much going on not too many folks were interesting in leaving the festivites to go on the trails. The Raindears kindly sent 3 boxes for the event which I planted and several kids and thier folks did hunt. I got my 7 box kids series planted yesterday and the clues are on the website. Tim's girls did a great job carving their stamps, my stamps are all store bought. I found them in a craft store in MD and they were so cute (and cheap! 50 � each!) that they gave me the idea for the series. </div>
<div> </div>
<div>All of these boxes are easy, the trails are all stroller accessible and perhaps even wheel chair accessible if you have someone who can push a wheelchair on a non-paved trail. There are restrooms and a playground at the park. Dogs are welcome just please clean up after them. If you like, stop at the office and introduce yourself to Tony while you're there. He's a great guy.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>We hope kids of all ages will enjoy them. I'm a little anxious about my clues so would appreciate feedback from the first finder. Thanks and have fun!</div>
