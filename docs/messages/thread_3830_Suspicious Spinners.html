<br/>
I have a little dreidel,<br/>
I made it out clay,<br/>
And when I tried to spin it,<br/>
It gave me a "gimel" all day!<br/>
<br/>
One of the most enjoyable parts of Chanukah is playing with dreidels, four sided<br/>
spinning tops. There are letters on each of the four sides: Nun,<br/>
Gimel, Hei, Shin. These letters stand for the<br/>
words Nes Gadol Hayah Sham  "a great miracle happened there", referring to the<br/>
miracle of Chanukah.<br/>
<br/>
I have a special dreidel whenever I spin it, it always lands on "gimel",<br/>
meaning that I win! However, this weighted spinning top doesn't do the same for<br/>
everybody else. After having some of my friends spin my dreidel 1E99 times, I<br/>
found out that:<br/>
<br/>
1) The chance of landing on a "shin" is three times greater than the chance of<br/>
landing on a "hei".<br/>
2) The chance of landing on a "nun" is half the chance of landing on a "shin".<br/>
3) The chance of landing on a "nun" is the same as the chance of rolling a two<br/>
on a single, unloaded die.<br/>
4) The dreidel always lands on one of its four sides.<br/>
<br/>
Now for some data<br/>
C: The inverse of the probability of landing on "gimel" or "hei"<br/>
D: The inverse of the probability of getting nothing<br/>
<br/>
"Daily Location":<br/>
- The number of sides with letters on a dreidel multiplied by the number of<br/>
pennies in a dollar.<br/>
- The first word of the name of the National Park located in Omeo.<br/>
- la calle<br/>
<br/>
- Google, placemarks, lines, yay!<br/>
<br/>
A micro box will be planted at this location shortly. It may or may not be<br/>
necessary to find this "MB" if you wish to find the final box.<br/>
