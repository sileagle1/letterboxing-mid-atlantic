<br/>
One of the many miracles of Chanukah is that after the Greeks destroyed the Second Temple in Jerusalem, the only pure oil that remained to light the eternal flame lasted for eight days instead of the expected one day.<br/>
<br/>
Looking at this situation from a chemical perspective, the burning of pure olive oil to produce light and heat is a combustion reaction. While we could examine the reason for the reaction lasting longer than it was supposed to, or whether this caused the flame to be any less bright, we are instead going to look at some relatively simple combustion reactions. In the following formatting, all numbers are meant to be SUBSCRIPTS, not COEFFICIENTS. In fact, none of these reactions are balanced<br/>
<br/>
Reaction 1:<br/>
C3H8 + O2 --&gt; CO2 + H20<br/>
<br/>
Reaction 2:<br/>
H2 + O2 --&gt; H20<br/>
<br/>
Reaction 3:<br/>
CH2S + F2 --&gt; CF4 + HF + SF6<br/>
<br/>
Based on the relative stoichiometry with lowest possible integer coefficients, find:<br/>
<br/>
E: [(number of moles of reactants of reaction 3)  (number of moles of products of reaction 2)] * (number of moles of reactants of reaction 1)<br/>
<br/>
Let delta n = (number of moles of products)  (number of moles of reactants)<br/>
<br/>
F: (delta n of reaction 1) * (delta n of reaction 2) * (delta n of reaction 3)<br/>
<br/>
Oh, and this might also come in handy: 40.552689,-75.529334<br/>
Nothing there, but it completes the first polygon. :-)<br/>
