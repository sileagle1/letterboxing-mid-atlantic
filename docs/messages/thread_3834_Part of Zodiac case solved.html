This must mean he has also found a key clue to finding another ZODIAC case, we are hoping it pertains to the 2 campers in Great Falls!..At least thats our hopes!...this might be the break we are looking for!<br/>

I have yet to hear back directly from Mr Rogue as to what he is up to now....I just hope he is on the right track.  Everything he needs is there!  Hopefully he can cap this thing off in the coming days!<br/>

I'm working all alone. (You removed me from the case right?)<br/>
But I have attempted to contact you directly many times... even sent you pictures of this very location... you don't respond. What I found was not at all helpful. (I had been to this very location several times before, what you call the "hoax" clues led me to this very spot last May) The key found here Monday morning must be to a different lock... because it opens nothing here for me. Ive been down the indicated paths and found the reoccurring themes.&lt;wink wink&gt;<br/>

18 months on this... and I'm no closer with the latest clue.<br/>

With the quickness of this find, I am sure we are closing in on the capture of the Zodiac and the location of the campers. I just hope you have all take propper notes in this case.  I have little doubts that things will get more difficult, and more active.<br/>

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I have yet to hear back directly from Mr Rogue as to what he is  <br/>
&gt; &gt; up to now....I just hope he is on the right track. Everything he  <br/>
&gt; &gt; needs is there! Hopefully he can cap this thing off in the coming  <br/>
&gt; &gt; days!<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; We also received another ZODIAC note this morning...We are  <br/>
&gt; &gt; deciphering it now...stay tuned<br/>
