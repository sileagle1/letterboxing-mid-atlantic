well behind us, it is time to look forward to the return of this gathering.<br/>
<br/>
This year it will be set in the sprawling suburbia of Sterling, VA.  We <br/>
will start out at Joe's Pizzeria, in the heart of Sterling Park.  <br/>
Afterwards we will move on to our place for some more food, drinks, <br/>
refreshment, a game of pool maybe, a fire, some indoor boxes, and some <br/>
night boxing outside.  I have some wonderful Miz Scarlet stamps that <br/>
have seen very little use, so they should be great fun to hunt in our <br/>
ivy covered backyard.<br/>
<br/>
It is also close to Schizokeet's birthday, so you can expect some cake <br/>
too :-)<br/>
<br/>
So we invite all to come out to Sterling on the 15th, the fun starts at <br/>
5 PM, giving you plenty of time to explore local parks and boxes as <br/>
well.  If you are traveling far we do have a place for you to stay if <br/>
you would like as well.  Hope to see some new faces as well as some old <br/>
friends.<br/>
