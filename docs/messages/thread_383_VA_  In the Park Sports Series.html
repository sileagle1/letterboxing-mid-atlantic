<div>Please tell me #1 is missing.  Either that, or I've lost my mind.  I iritated some poor LARGE dog to death--probably would have been my death if it had jumped the fence!   I spent 45 minutes at the site pacing back and forth, checking from every stretch of the fence for 3-in-1 trees.  Only one I saw was tiny next to the golf course fence, and it was swept clean.  I did find 3 golf balls though, which I'll share with 1 relative.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>#2 was an easy find, if in an odd spot.  Logbook is dry, and box looks good for almost 2 years old.  I collected a sample of an odd prickly seed from the bush you have to push past to get around the corner of the fence.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>#3  I'm pretty sure I was in the right spot, but it just got too dark, too quickly to hunt for it, so maybe next Monday when I can get back to it.</div>

<div>Thanks,<br/>FamilyMan</div><p>
