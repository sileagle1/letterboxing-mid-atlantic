&gt; Is this the stuff that is more like "firmcut"?  It sounds like it.   <br/>
&gt; I've heard similar results from the firmcut and that it does not carve  <br/>
&gt; well.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; What a shame.  Looks like pink and orange will be back in vogue.......<br/>

Carving the stuff with a knife can be a bit trying because the pieces you are cutting out don't break off easily like they did with the old PZ. I didn't notice any problem with inking but the one stamp that I have done on it so far was (like many of my stamps) an image with mostly small lines of inked areas, think coloring book image. I did try using a gouge on the stuff to but you need to apply more pressure than with other materials. You will have to be careful not to "slip" when pushing on the gouge.<br/>
