                    <div id="ygrps-yiv-446499828">I have experimented with some of the Dixie stuff that Chuck from Soulmates donated to me.  Of the different ones, I am still trying to figure out the 'Smooth Cut' stuff - it is granular like the cheapest dollar store eraser, but no ability to heat transfer copier toner images to it.  The more intriguing stuff was the material that had the black tire backing - similar in consistency to the pink stuff, but slightly more granular.  Some of my late October plants used the black backed material.<br/>
<br/>
The brown stuff almost melted when I tried to heat transfer an image, but is does have a heavy interesting consistency.  Probably better for hand drawn things.<br/>

More later,<br/>

&gt; &gt; Noticed Dixie has a carving material listed on her site, any one know anything about it?<br/>
