<br/>
'cause I have another!<br/>
<br/>
A dog walks into a bar and asks the bartender for a whiskey<br/>
The bartender duly obliges and gives the dog a whiskey.<br/>
<br/>
Looking perplexed another customer says to the barman `Thats a bit unusual wasn't it?'<br/>
<br/>
Yes replied the barman, he usually orders a scotch!<br/>
