<p class="ygrps-yiv-527388927MsoNormal"><b><span style="font-size:11pt;font-family:Arial;color:rgb(0, 51, 102);">THIRTEEN THINGS YOUR BURGLAR WON'T TELL YOU : <br/>
<br/>
1. Of course I look familiar. I was here just last week cleaning your carpets,
painting your shutters, or delivering your new refrigerator. <br/>
<br/>
2. Hey, thanks for letting me use the bathroom when I was working in your yard
last week. While I was in there, I unlatched the back window to make my return
a little easier. <br/>
<br/>
3. Love those flowers. That tells me you have taste... and taste means there
are nice things inside. Those yard toys your kids leave out always make me
wonder what type of gaming system they have. <br/>
<br/>
4. Yes, I really do look for newspapers piled up on the driveway. And I might
leave a pizza flyer in your front door to see how long it takes you to remove
it.. <br/>
<br/>
5. If it snows while you're out of town, get a neighbor to create car and foot
tracks into the house. Virgin drifts in the driveway are a dead giveaway. <br/>
<br/>
6. If decorative glass is part of your front entrance, don't let your alarm
company install the control pad where I can see if it's set. That makes it too
easy. <br/>
<br/>
7. A good security company alarms the window over the sink. And the windows on
the second floor, which often access the master bedroom - and your jewelry.
It's not a bad idea to put motion detectors up there too. <br/>
<br/>
8. It's raining, you're fumbling with your umbrella, and you forget to lock
your door - understandable. But understand this: I don't take a day off because
of bad weather. <br/>
<br/>
9. I always knock first. If you answer, I'll ask for directions somewhere or
offer to clean your gutters. (Don't take me up on it.) <br/>
<br/>
10. Do you really think I won't look in your sock drawer? I always check
dresser drawers, the bedside table, and the medicine cabinet. <br/>
<br/>
11. Here's a helpful hint: I almost never go into kids' rooms. <br/>
<br/>
12. You're right: I won't have enough time to break into that safe where you
keep your valuables. But if it's not bolted down, I'll take it with me.. <br/>
<br/>
13. A loud TV or radio can be a better deterrent than the best alarm system. If
you're reluctant to leave your TV on while you're out of town, you can buy a
$35 device that works on a timer and simulates the flickering glow of a real
television. (Find it at <a href="http://www.faketv.com/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.faketv.com</a>)
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
8 MORE THINGS A BURGLAR WON'T TELL YOU : <br/>
<br/>
1. Sometimes, I carry a clipboard. Sometimes, I dress like a lawn guy and carry
a rake. I do my best to never, ever look like a crook. <br/>
<br/>
2. The two things I hate most: loud dogs and nosy neighbors. <br/>
<br/>
3. I'll break a window to get in, even if it makes a little noise. If your
neighbor hears one loud sound, he'll stop what he's doing and wait to hear it
again. If he doesn't hear it again, he'll just go back to what he was doing..
It's human nature. <br/>
<br/>
4. I'm not complaining, but why would you pay all that money for a fancy alarm
system and leave your house without setting it? <br/>
<br/>
5. I love looking in your windows. I'm looking for signs that you're home, and
for flat screen TVs or gaming systems I'd like. I'll drive or walk through your
neighborhood at night, before you close the blinds, just to pick my targets. <br/>
<br/>
6. Avoid announcing your vacation on your Facebook page.. It's easier than you
think to look up your address. <br/>
<br/>
7. To you, leaving that window open just a crack during the day is a way to let
in a little fresh air. To me, it's an invitation. <br/>
<br/>
8. If you don't answer when I knock, I try the door. Occasionally, I hit the
jackpot and walk right in. <br/>

Protection for you and your home: <br/>
<br/>
If you don't have a gun, here's a more humane way to wreck someone's evil plans
for you.. (I guess I can get rid of the baseball bat.): <br/>
<br/>
</span></b><b><span style="font-size:11pt;font-family:Arial;color:red;">WASP
SPRAY <br/>
<br/>
A friend who is a receptionist in a church in a high risk area was concerned
about someone coming into the office on Monday to rob them when they were
counting the collection. She asked the local police department about using
pepper spray and they recommended to her that she get a can of wasp spray
instead. <br/>
<br/>
The wasp spray, they told her, can shoot up to twenty feet away and is a lot
more accurate, while with the pepper spray, they have to get too close to you
and could overpower you. The wasp spray temporarily blinds an attacker until
they get to the hospital for an antidote. She keeps a can on her desk in the
office and it doesn't attract attention from people like a can of pepper spray
would.. She also keeps one nearby at home for home protection. Thought this was
interesting and might be of use. <br/>
</span></b><b><span style="font-size:11pt;font-family:Arial;color:rgb(0, 51, 102);"><br/>
FROM ANOTHER SOURCE.... <br/>
<br/>
On the heels of a break-in and beating that left an elderly woman in Toledo
dead, self-defense experts have a tip that could save your life. <br/>
<br/>
Val Glinka teaches self-defense to students at Sylvania Southview High School .
For decades, he's suggested putting a can of wasp and hornet spray near your
door or bed. <br/>
<br/>
Glinka says, "This is better than anything I can teach them." <br/>
<br/>
Glinka considers it inexpensive, easy to find, and more effective than mace or
pepper spray. The cans typically shoot 20 to 30 feet; so if someone tries to
break into your home, Glinka says, "spray the culprit in the eyes".
It's a tip he's given to students for decades. It's also one he wants everyone
to hear. If you're looking for protection, Glinka says look to the spray. <br/>
<br/>
"That's going to give you a chance to call the police; maybe get
out.." <br/>
<br/>
Maybe even save a life. <br/>
<br/>
</span></b><b><span style="font-size:11pt;font-family:Arial;color:blue;">Put
your car keys beside your bed at night.</span></b><b><span style="font-size:11pt;font-family:Arial;color:rgb(0, 51, 102);"> <br/>
<br/>
Tell your spouse, your children, your neighbors, your parents, your Dr.'s
office, the check-out girl at the market, everyone you run across. </span></b><b><span style="font-size:11pt;font-family:Arial;color:red;">Put your car keys beside
your bed at night. <br/>
<br/>
If you hear a noise outside your home or someone trying to get in your house,
just press the panic button for your car. The alarm will be set off, and the
horn will continue to sound until either you turn it off or the car battery
dies. </span></b><b><span style="font-size:11pt;font-family:Arial;color:rgb(0, 51, 102);">This
tip came from a neighborhood watch coordinator. Next time you come home for the
night and you start to put your keys away, think of this: It's a security alarm
system that you probably already have and requires no installation. Test it. It
will go off from most everywhere inside your house and will keep honking until
your battery runs down or until you reset it with the button on the key fob
chain. It works if you park in your driveway or garage. If your car alarm goes
off when someone is trying to break into your house, odds are the
burglar/rapist won't stick around. After a few seconds all the neighbors will
be looking out their windows to see who is out there and sure enough the
criminal won't want that. And remember to carry your keys while walking to your
car in a parking lot. The alarm can work the same way there. This is something
that should really be shared with everyone. Maybe it could save a life or a
sexual abuse crime. <br/>
<br/>
P.S. I am sending this to everyone I know because I think it is fantastic.
Would also be useful for any emergency, such as a heart attack, where you can't
reach a phone. My Mom has suggested to my Dad that he carry his car keys with
him in case he falls outside and she doesn't hear him. He can activate the car
alarm and then she'll know there's a problem. <br/>
<br/>
Please pass this on even IF you've read it before. It's a reminder. <br/>
<br/>
Please share this with all the people in your life. </span></b><span style="font-size:11pt;font-family:Arial;"></span></p>
