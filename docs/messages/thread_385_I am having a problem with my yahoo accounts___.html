reply/compaose page is not fully loading, just the "Send to" <br/>
and "Subject" lines are there. none of the Cc: or Bcc: lines. and <br/>
when I click send I get a tiny "page error" notification in the <br/>
lower left. I went through Yahoo help files and tried to get <br/>
to "File Manager" as suggested but don't have that option on my menu <br/>
bar in Tools? Anywho, I have contact the folks at yahoo and am <br/>
waiting for an answer. Everything was fine last night and then I got <br/>
an email form letterboxing.central titled "Your Letter". I was on <br/>
letterboxing.central recently checking out T-Shirts and don't <br/>
remember paosting anything to them but thought "Who knows?" maybe I <br/>
did? When I opened the email there was nothing there and I <br/>
thougth "Oh $#@!. But my computer has been fine. Now I am wondering <br/>
it it may have been a virus. But the wierd thing is this is <br/>
happening no matter where I access Yahoo from, at home or my two <br/>
PC's at work. And it's just yahoo. My outlook is fine. Anyway, I can <br/>
read emailsI just can't reply to them right now. I am posting this <br/>
from the messages section in groups.<br/>

problem with my browser. I could scream. My husband and son both use <br/>
this machine and have yahoo accounts that are working fine! And this <br/>
yahoo account is doing the same thing from my two PC's at work. So <br/>
how can it be my browser? I can read every email, but have no way to <br/>
reply to any of them. If anyone needs to email me offlist better <br/>
include your phone number so that I can reply by telephone. I've got <br/>
a couple of boxing things planned this weekend that I need to <br/>
discuss with folks. <br/>
<br/>
If I could get Yahoo on the phone and actually talk to a human being <br/>
perhaps they would understand what the problem is! Does anyone have <br/>
a telphone number for yahoo? Please email me offlist if you do. I <br/>
can read your emails, but nothing else! <br/>

pays for his Democrat account on yahoo and had a problem and they <br/>
gave him a ph# for support. I guess us freebie freeloaders don't get <br/>
it, LOL! I called and they are closed so I will call back 1st thing <br/>
in the AM. I will never call Harris a pack-rat again! I was thinking <br/>
about it and worst case scenario I would create a reply ID for <br/>
hikers_n_hounds. something like hnh or something. I can't change <br/>
over all of my letterboxing stuff, and I can still read messages and <br/>
post via the message board. I just can't do anything beyond deleting <br/>
the messages I receive. Oh well, we'll see. I got your message and <br/>
I'm cool with that. <br/>
