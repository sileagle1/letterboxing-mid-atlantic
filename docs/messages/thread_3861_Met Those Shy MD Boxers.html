On my way to my first box I came upon a family of 3 and their dog.  With my Clue Cozy swaying in the breeze, they asked "Are you letterboxing?".  Seems they had read the Post article and were out to find their first letterbox.  I asked their trail names and they looked surprised!  They had store bought stamps and became Two Pines and Cowboy Andy by the second box.  Cowboy Andy got distracted by the tot lot - I went on to find the rest of the series.<br/>
<br/>
Then I got to meet the planter at the Shy MD'rs event.  Wood Thrush has a civil war soldier buried on the hillside in her 'backyard' - to where the event box was clued.<br/>

It was a real treat to sit and chat around the table about finds, carvers and travels.<br/>

yesterday, so pretty much had to be there ;-)<br/>
<br/>
We did get out and find one box, box one of the Big Cats series at <br/>
Cedarville State Forest.  Bow was a little nibbled on but in otherwise <br/>
fine shape.  We had to turn back due to the lack of light, but it was <br/>
still a very nice two mile walk, and we saw nobody else on the trail, so <br/>
very quiet too.<br/>

This was a very nice venue for those who are overwhelmed in such large groups. Good to see you again SSB!<br/>
