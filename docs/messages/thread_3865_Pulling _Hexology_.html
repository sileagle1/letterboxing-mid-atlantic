Thanks for the info! Yes, it is a hex sign. I tried to find the Hex Sign trail via google and was not successful. Where is this trail? I will have to take a drive up to Lenhardtsville to check it out.  It may be a bit far for me to hide there, as I like to check on my boxes often. (I can say that because I have only planted 5!)<br/>

<br/>
Here is some info on the Hex Highways:<br/>
<br/>
<a href="http://www.hexsigns.org/hex-tour-map2009.pdf" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.hexsigns.org/hex-tour-map2009.pdf</a><br/>
<br/>
I often toyed with planting a series of hex themed boxes on the hike up to the Pinnacle and Pulpit Rock, but since this hike is a touch strenuous (8 miles, rocky with 1000 ft elevation gain), I tend to notice that boxes up there do not get much traffic, despite the beauty of the location.<br/>
<br/>
Cheers,<br/>
