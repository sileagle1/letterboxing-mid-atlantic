Message to Webmasters,<br/>

	From: Jennifer Massengill:<br/>
<br/>
Message:<br/>
I found a letterbox today.  I wasn't looking for it; it was sitting on <br/>
the side<br/>
of the trail where I was jogging.  The top wasn't on properly and it <br/>
was sitting<br/>
out in the open, so I'm thinking that it was found accidentally by <br/>
someone who<br/>
isn't a letterboxer and abandoned when they didn't know what to do with <br/>
it.  I<br/>
hit it in what seemed like a logical place, but since I didn't find it <br/>
on a<br/>
hunt, I'm not sure that it was the right place.  I tried to find a <br/>
listing that<br/>
seemed to match, but couldn't find one.  Do you happen to have a kind <br/>
of lost<br/>
and found?  The box was next to the Greensprings Trail in Williamsburg, <br/>
VA.  I<br/>
hid it behind a nearby log.  Thanks.<br/>
