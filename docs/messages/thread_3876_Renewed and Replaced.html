<br/>
We had found the lighthouse box as well, a complete mess! The old (assumed) pink log book was soaked.  We replaced it as we found it (outside baggie and all) and emailed Jessica about it's condition. We searched for a lot of classic boxes this week and ran out of pre-made log books and freezer baggies. Would have replaced and or repaired if we had any supplies left over.  I had hoped we would run into the planter at her family's diner to report on the classic.<br/>
<br/>
Did anyone go looking for SSB's Cape Henlopen Dunes box? Looked for that as well, but did not look very long because we were being battered by the wind up on the dunes.  I was really looking forward to finding it.<br/>
