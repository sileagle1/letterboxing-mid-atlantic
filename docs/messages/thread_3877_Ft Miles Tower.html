<br/>
Found by new boxer a few weeks ago<br/>
Could not be found by other boxers during gathering weekend<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
The new boxer replaced the box under the correct tree, but in a spot different from where it had been.  Because the last previous find was our box check in February, the new boxer found the box in the place indicated on the clue but did not put it back there - was close, about 8 feet away.  It took us about 10 minutes of circling the tree before we found it.<br/>
<br/>
So, Ft. Miles Tower is alive and well.  That is very cool.  <br/>
<br/>
However, we moved it to different tree in the hope of preventing future confusion.  I will update the clue today.<br/>
<br/>
Because this is the second time that something like this has happened to this particular box, we are also going to put a small find count restriction on the clue.  We've never done that before and we still don't like the idea but it looks necessary right now.<br/>
<br/>
We say that our hobby does not have rules.  Really, though, it has conventions, including double-bagging logs and putting a box back where you found it unless that's a really bad idea, in which case you put it in a safe place nearby and notify the placer immediately.<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, that's the story.  Thanks, everyone who contributed to this mystery.<br/>

<br/>
I think that this particular box, being in a popular vacation spot, draws a lot of new boxers.  New boxers aren't the only ones who make mistakes.<br/>
<br/>
As Cyclonic saw, we left a lot of footprints out there in the sand so until the next storm, it's pretty much a big arrow toward the box.<br/>

Eh, if we come up with a perfect solution then we will be sure to post it here  :)<br/>

I tend to very much disagree.  The boxes listed on LBNA tend to get far
more traffic, and far more of the new boxer traffic, then boxes listed
on AQ.<br/>
<br/>
This I can attest to through experience.  My own boxes, which are
listed only on AQ, get very little new boxer type traffic, even the
easy ones which are created for newer boxers.  Also, in my travels I
have found the same to be true with boxes I have found.  Even boxes
close to each other, the box listed on LBNA gets may more new boxers
finding it.<br/>
<br/>
While the site may be easier to use, and may have the appearance that
it was made for kids, it also doesn't populate first on a Goggle
search, LBNA does.  AQ comes up third, it has for a very long time, and
in a search, which would you click on first?<br/>

Not sure there is a good way to go with this, I don't like find <br/>
restriction and I think the clue is already challenging.  I think it is <br/>
what it is, unfortunately.<br/>
