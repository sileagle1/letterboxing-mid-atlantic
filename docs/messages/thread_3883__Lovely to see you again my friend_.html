&gt; &gt; Sorry I had to back out of that one. But then we just saw each other crawlin' <br/>
&gt; &gt; 'round Rehoboth! Did you encounter any hills? Podiatrist just told me I am not <br/>
&gt; &gt; to hike up or down hills. But isn't the position of the foot hiking up the same <br/>
&gt; &gt; as that stomping down on the gas pedal?? Whoa is me - until I get some therapy.<br/>

&gt; &gt; &gt; be able to take the day off and catch up with them. Then Miz Scarlet came up <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; later in the day and eventually we all meet at a local pub for dinner where we <br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; were joined by several other area boxers and everyone seemed to have a great <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; time. Many thanks to The Bug for taking time off to come out and lead the <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; charge. to everyone else who showed up to provide a wamr PA welcome to the <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; Pepes, and to Mark and Sue for just be themselves. I had a wonderful day, and <br/>

&gt; &gt; It was a good fun day - I had recommended the non-hilly so that folks would not get too tuckered.  I am glad you made it home safely, as we were concerned about Irene being Igreen.<br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; Next time, South Mountain?  ;-)<br/>

&gt; &gt; &gt; Actually I have been plagued with a wierd virus since Sat and was green around <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; hte gills, still am. I only hiked a little and spent a lot of time parked in the <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; shade in the car! But from what I heard there wasn;t much in the way of hills. I <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; will have to go back there when I have a car and catch up on what I missed! But <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; it was great seeing old friends.Â Sorry 'bout your foot old mum.<br/>
