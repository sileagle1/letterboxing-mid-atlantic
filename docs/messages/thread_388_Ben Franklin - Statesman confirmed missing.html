so glad I found it! I plan to go out Saturday or<br/>
Sunday ealry in the am for some of the others. OR, the<br/>
Jane Austin boxes I figured out. Yes, that's right, I<br/>
said it! I figured out Mansfeild Park and Emma! Sure,<br/>
they're not the hardest mystery boxes in the world,<br/>
but I am still pretty darn excited. So is Audry<br/>
Cahilly as she now does not have to eat her stamp!<br/>
LOL! Although I believe that bet was if I couldn't<br/>
figure out "Signature" I think it was. And I can't. So<br/>
I don't know Aud, keep the salt and pepper handy...<br/>
