Thanks for your input Mike. While it's certainly tempting sometimes <br/>
to just publicly shout out "Tell me what you know!", I certainly <br/>
respect Randy's (and other's) hard work and wouldn't publicly post <br/>
findings or ideas. <br/>
<br/>
Just my $.02, since I started this thread :-p<br/>

tiny bit of confirmation, in that there's a geocache<br/>
right nearby maintained by someone on another list I'm<br/>
