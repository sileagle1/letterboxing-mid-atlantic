What I've learned:<br/>
If the tree falls off the beaten path somewhere, so what?<br/>
If the hazardous tree had been threatening to fall (as determined by a "reasonable and prudent person") on a path, and does, and does injury, the property owner is liable.<br/>
If the target is a campsite, bench or other place where people could be expected to be at rest, not moving, the property owner is toast.<br/>
<br/>
Look up before you stand still.<br/>

The trees suck up more water weight into their leaf canopies then the limbs can bear and they can actually just fall off on a perfectly still day.<br/>
