Heading into my last week of travel as I ride the rails from Mount Vernon WA to Portland OR.<br/>
Had a delightful day of boxing when Lemon Drop (Griffindors) and Mariner Fan picked me up from my B&amp;B (Whispering Firs)to meet up with Thunderbird and then lo &amp; behold Amanda and Ryan were walking down the trail. 19 boxes and a full lunch later I was exhausted!!<br/>
<br/>
Highly recommend WF high up the mountain in Mount Vernon -- providing you have a car or some boxers to pick you up.  I joined their start of a family reunion as Aunt J, long lost half sister of Linda's brother who couldn't remember much of the past or family because of the 'accident'.  i.e. had a wonderful time and saw my first bear up close . . . albeit stuffed in the living room!<br/>
<br/>
Haven't posted all that went before because my I-net access has been slow and this notebook keybd is still too tiny for comfort.  But it is great that the train has both power and WiFi!!  Not enough time to listen to another hour of CD (Villa Incognito by Tom Robbins) very weird but attention getting.<br/>
<br/>
Train passed thru Centralia where DeniseRows and I had spent 4 days at the Olympic Club and I felt like I was passing by 'home'.  That place is a must on any Left Coast travel.  Actually the train on the Left Coast is much nicer than that which I rode from DC to Savannah a few years back!  <br/>
<br/>
Enough for now.<br/>
Hope all are surviving the heat.<br/>

    Yeah, far too hot, but we still managed to get four drive bys while
    out and about today.  We had not boxed much at all recently, our
    Philly trip was almost completely dry, but last weekend in the
    northern reaches of New York we got a pile of them.<br/>
<br/>
    I too would like to get out on the trail next weekend, still some up
    on Bull Run Mountain I have yet to find.<br/>
