<br/>
The park has tons of hiking trails and is next to Catoctin Mountain Park <br/>
which has tons more.  Also, obviously, it has a nice waterfall and lake <br/>
with swimming and boating.<br/>
<br/>
Thurmont is halfway between Frederick and Gettysburg on Route 15, so you <br/>
are close to tons of historic attractions as well as shopping and <br/>
restaurants if you don't want to eat in camp the whole time.  There are <br/>
a few boxes in the park, one that I know of at Catoctin, and a bunch <br/>
more in the area by various planters.<br/>
