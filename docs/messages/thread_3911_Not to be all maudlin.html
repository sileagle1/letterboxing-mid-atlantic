Right now, I can't truly grasp the following scenario:  a box has been planted, anywhere in the world, and we find it 15 seconds later, with no chance that Otis' Friends has already found it???  Sorry but that makes no sense.<br/>

So, if you really are retiring, that sux and I am sorry, but I hope that you pull a Brett Favre on us...<br/>

I hope find happiness in your new ventures.<br/>

Let me know if you have no takers on the clues. I would love to have any clues of old boxes not listed anywhere else. Especially of there is even the slightest chance of them still being around.<br/>
