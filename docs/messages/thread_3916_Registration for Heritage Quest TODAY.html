Four if by Sea and myself will have a table with registration forms and information. We will also have our signature stamps ready to exchange!<br/>
<br/>
Heritage Quest is a Downtown Scavenger hunt that is open to anyone but should be appealing to letterboxers! It will include Trivia type questions, stamps, scavenger hunt gathering and fun! <br/>
<br/>
The Heritage Quest is being planned by letterboxers, but is being hosted by the city of Charles Town Heritage Festival and will be held on September 17 from 10:30-2:00.<br/>
<br/>
Also, there is a letterboxer meet and greet after the Quest posted on AQ.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
We hope to see you there!<br/>
