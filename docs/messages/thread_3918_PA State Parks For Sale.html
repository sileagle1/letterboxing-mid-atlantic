<br/>
1.  The current administration sells our Parks to companies who will "manage" them.<br/>
2.  Just coincidentally, those companies will make large political contributions to that same administration.<br/>
3.  The companies will operate them as a profit-making enterprise.  We will have to pay to visit the parks that our parents built and our tax dollars paid for.<br/>
4.  A few years down the line, the parks closer to population centers will start losing money.  Apparently you just can't make 20% quarterly profit on hiking and fishing. And the companies will get permission to turn the park into luxury home developments and golf courses.<br/>
5.  A few years down the line, the parks farther away from population centers will start losing money.  Apparently you just can't make 20% quarterly profit on hiking and fishing. Those will slowly be opened to logging and mining and drilling.<br/>
