on a bunch of my boxes:<br/>
<br/>
Topsy Tervy: Alive and well, not found in a very long time.<br/>
Eye in the Sky: Gone, area is even more overgrown, will be retired.<br/>
Celtic Flower: Gone, the object it was hidden on it completely gone, <br/>
will be retired.<br/>
Beast from the Barrens: Gone, looks to be the victim of some flooding, <br/>
will be replaced because I still love the clue.<br/>
Neshaminy Hitch Hiker Hostel: Gone, area was clear cut, the park ranger <br/>
may have it, will be retired.<br/>
Kite and Key: Found what was left of it, the log is gone, but I have the <br/>
box and stamp, so it will be replaced.<br/>
<br/>
Now to figure out where I put Sheba's stamps so I can get them placed <br/>
this week ;-)<br/>
