                    <div id="ygrps-yiv-658742729">I just got a report that my "Happy Wanderer" box in PA has had a third finder and that it is still in "excellent condition".  We planted the box 6.5 years ago (May 2005).  It was first found in 2006, then in 2007 and apparently spent several lonely years up there before it had a visitor today.<br/>

P.S.  I also received reports that my more recently planted boxes in Maine and New Hampshire were found last weekend.  The mild winter is good for letterboxing!</div>
