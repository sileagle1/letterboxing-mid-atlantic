Also, I've planted two new boxes, "What Exit? Rt. 21" and "I've Seen the Light".  <br/>

I went to South Mountain Reservation the other day to try and find the box of the same name (missing, of course).  It was originally planted in 2003, and was in the Basement since at least 2007.  I'd like to try and replant it with the original image.  Anybody out there who found it that could send me the stamp image?  Thanks.<br/>

Troth Stone was a beautiful romantic scene to propose, if you like that kind of thing. I worried about the stone-in-the-wall, however.<br/>
<br/>
The box for South Mountain Reservation lasted two years until the hollow tree fell over, and it has long since disintegrated; cahillymom found it in May 2005. I am convinced that the box is still there, just buried in the old roots of the tree. However, it is too close to the road for an exploratory dig. Good luck with that one.<br/>

<div>I know which one you're talking about, though I haven't found it yet, but "For the Birds (NJ)" is one that I planted myself in a different spot, that went missing back in 2008-2009 shortly after I planted it.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>I had misgivings about the wall hide, too.  When I was there last, I found it under some leaves right out on the ground.  It was lucky that I came across it, really.  When I replant it, I'm going to find a diffrent spot nearby that's less "destructive".</div>
<div> </div>
<div>As for South Mountain, I already have another possible planting spot in mind, just a few steps away from the old one (I think...  I'm not sure I know where the tree is/was)</div>
