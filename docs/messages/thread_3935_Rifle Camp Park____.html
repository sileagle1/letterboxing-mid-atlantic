Unfortunately, the box contents were waterlogged.  I had originally planned on just photographing the logbook (It's been there since 2003, and I didn't get the chance to peruse the entries at the time), but I wound up pulling the box so I can dry out the logbook and rehabilitate it.<br/>
<br/>
The last find was in May, 2011, and from the look of the final entry, it was soggy even then.  A lot of the pages were sticking together and there's a bit of mildew.  Still, a lot of folks used pigment ink and you can still make out many of the stamps.  I saw a lot of friendly "faces" in there.  (Who'da thunk I would find a box before JerseyTrailblazers...)<br/>
<br/>
I thought I'd let everybody know, just in case they had plans to nab it.<br/>
