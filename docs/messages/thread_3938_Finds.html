It was nice to get the note he had found them and enjoyed the hike and places our boxes take him. That is what we love about letterboxing too.</div>

&gt; Love that there are boxers out there that take the time to go after  <br/>
&gt; the big hike boxes.  I planted such a box in Nov 2009 and it has yet  <br/>
&gt; to have a finder.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I too have found that those boxes are extremely rewarding to find and  <br/>
&gt; come with excellent journeys.<br/>
