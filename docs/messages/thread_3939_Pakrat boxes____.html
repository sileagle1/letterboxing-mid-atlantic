<br/>
I don't remember if I posted this before, but I had to pull World War None due to some cleanup in the area and possible development of the land on which it was planted.  I will update when the circumstances change and I can put the box back out.<br/>
<br/>
I stopped by the Essex County Environmental Center and found that the massive tree which hid the letterbox of the same name in the pocket formed by three trunks had cracked asunder and two of the trunks lay in splintered ruin.  Said letterbox was exposed for the world to see.  Given the state of its hiding spot, I thought it would be prudent to pull the box until such time as I can get in touch with its planter, "liz".  In the meantime, I'll see what I can do to maintain it.<br/>
