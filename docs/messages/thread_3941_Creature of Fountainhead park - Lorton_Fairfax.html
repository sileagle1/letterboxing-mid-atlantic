With new boxes on some of the trails these are planted on and room for others we have decided to retire these boxes at the end of the summer. <br/>
<br/>
So if you don't have these boxes yet you have the summer to get to them. There's some wonderful carves by boxers from all over and the clues take you to some wonderful hidden areas of the park. A few of the locations I think we will add new boxes to and a later date but it's time for these boxes to be pulled.<br/>
<br/>
We will send a note when these are pulled but I am leaning towards pulling them November 10th which will be 10 years and 1 day from when part one was planted...:)<br/>
