After powering off computer when I rebooted it happened again!<br/>
<br/>
Has anyone else had that experience??<br/>
<br/>
Sent an email to Amanda (didn't have GT's e-ddress) but it is only 6:45A out there now!!<br/>
<br/>
Kapersky security software didn't find any virus or such so I don't think it possessed my computer -- only AQ !!<br/>

Ryan is deleting bad files and It will still probably be a couple of hours before things will be back to somewhat normal. Thanks for your patience! <br/>
