<br/>
I've replanted both the Troth Stone as well as the Holland's Opus boxes.  Holland is in the same spot as before, hopefully better able to weather a flood. Troth Stone has been moved slightly, so if you're going after that one, please reprint the clue.  Heartbeat Road is back, too, also in a different spot.  The original box is probably still out there, but has most likely been covered up by erosion; I know I couldn't find it, and I'm the one who planted the darn thing...  If you're stubborn and want to find the original box, feel free (I'll e-mail you the original clue), and if you do manage to find it, let me know and you'll have my undying gratitude, as well as the answers to five yes/no questions about any of my boxes.<br/>
<br/>
I checked on Driving Round NJ 2, and it is still in place.  DRNJ4 has gone missing, and will be replanted in a completely different location, probably a completely different town and/or county.  I'll update when it's back out.<br/>
<br/>
The following Pakrat boxes remain unfound:  Freak's Peak, Holland's Opus (HikerGuyEd found the plant spot first, unfortunately the box had already gone on a boating trip...), 100 Steps of Doom, You Are a Pirate, Elizabeth River Park Bonus, Siskakes, Sisterhood, Where Am I?, What Exit, Rt 21?, Tiny Dancer, and Get Lucy.<br/>
