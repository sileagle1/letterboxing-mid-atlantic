<br/>
It has been a few years, so I figured it was time to bring the gathering <br/>
back.  It is staying in Maryland, but this time moving a bit west to <br/>
Cunningham Falls State Park in Thurmont, MD.  There is a large <br/>
campground there, and plenty of hiking to be had, though not many <br/>
boxes.  That will change, however ;-)<br/>
<br/>
You do not have to camp in order to come to the gathering.  There will <br/>
be a day portion to the gathering, on Saturday, September 8, from <br/>
10AM-2PM.  We'll meet at the William Hauck Picnic Area in the park.  <br/>
This area is at the end of the road leading to the lake, within the <br/>
road's loop.  We'll be in the back of the loop.  There is no pavilion, <br/>
we will just be gathering at a grouping of tables near the back of the loop.<br/>
<br/>
A new series of boxes is being planted within walking distance of the <br/>
picnic area.  Clues will be available to print off as part of a packet <br/>
before the gathering.  A few packets will also be available at the <br/>
gathering.<br/>
<br/>
These gatherings tend to be very low key, hang out if you like or hit <br/>
the trails, it is up to you!<br/>
<br/>
Please, bring a dish to share.<br/>
<br/>
For the campers...<br/>
<br/>
Site 107 in the Deer Spring Branch loop of the William Hauck campground <br/>
will be our base camp.  This site still has plenty of sites near it <br/>
open, so folks should book their sites now.  The site also sits right <br/>
next to three cabins, for those that don't want to do tent camping.<br/>
<br/>
 From here we will have a Saturday night campfire and begin the night <br/>
boxing.  The campfire and night boxing are open to all, even if you are <br/>
not camping (non-campers will need to park in overflow parking and walk <br/>
to the campsite.<br/>

<div>It is back, the Campin' and Stampin' Gathering.<br/>
<br/>
It has been a few years, so I figured it was time to bring the gathering <br/>
back.  It is staying in Maryland, but this time moving a bit west to <br/>
Cunningham Falls State Park in Thurmont, MD.  There is a large <br/>
campground there, and plenty of hiking to be had, though not many <br/>
boxes.  That will change, however ;-)<br/>
<br/>
You do not have to camp in order to come to the gathering.  There will <br/>
be a day portion to the gathering, on Saturday, September 8, from <br/>
10AM-2PM.  We'll meet at the William Hauck Picnic Area in the park.  <br/>
This area is at the end of the road leading to the lake, within the <br/>
road's loop.  We'll be in the back of the loop.  There is no pavilion, <br/>
we will just be gathering at a grouping of tables near the back of the loop.<br/>
<br/>
A new series of boxes is being planted within walking distance of the <br/>
picnic area.  Clues will be available to print off as part of a packet <br/>
before the gathering.  A few packets will also be available at the <br/>
gathering.<br/>
<br/>
These gatherings tend to be very low key, hang out if you like or hit <br/>
the trails, it is up to you!<br/>
<br/>
Please, bring a dish to share.<br/>
<br/>
For the campers...<br/>
<br/>
Site 107 in the Deer Spring Branch loop of the William Hauck campground <br/>
will be our base camp.  This site still has plenty of sites near it <br/>
open, so folks should book their sites now.  The site also sits right <br/>
next to three cabins, for those that don't want to do tent camping.<br/>
<br/>
From here we will have a Saturday night campfire and begin the night <br/>
boxing.  The campfire and night boxing are open to all, even if you are <br/>
not camping (non-campers will need to park in overflow parking and walk <br/>
to the campsite.<br/>
