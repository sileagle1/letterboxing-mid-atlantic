I sent this to the group already but it never showed up - so please <br/>
forgive if it eventually does shows up !!!!  (this is why its always <br/>
a good idea to copy your messages before you post them)<br/>

Hello,<br/>
<br/>
&lt;corny&gt; drum roll please.....<br/>
<br/>
Today is one month til the gathering.  I can't to see you guys again.<br/>
<br/>
I may be asking a bit much here (sorry) but I really need you to <br/>
start seriously thinking about if your going to join us or not.  If <br/>
you have not already RSVP me by email, not this list  p l e a s e  do <br/>
so and tell me how many people you think might be in your party.  I <br/>
know you may not know for sure right now, but please guessimate.<br/>
<br/>
To the people who have already emailed me will you please update the <br/>
totals I have here when you know for sure. I know you may not know <br/>
for sure right now, but please guessimate.<br/>
<br/>
The reason why I am asking is because I will be ordering a huge <br/>
lunchmeat tray with all the fixins and need to have a head count for <br/>
the store by the 9th of October.  <br/>
