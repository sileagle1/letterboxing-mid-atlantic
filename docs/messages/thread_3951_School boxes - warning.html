<br/>
A stranger poking around school property wearing a pack and looking at directions of some kind will definitely cause a school to go into "lock down," which is when all teachers and students huddle silently in darkened rooms behind locked doors.<br/>
<br/>
It will also cause every police officer within several minutes of high-speed driving to come to the school, full of adrenaline and ready to rumble.<br/>
<br/>
After you get arrested, the incident will become front-page and viral news, bringing lots of unwanted attention to our hobby.  The same thing happened a few years ago to some hash-house harriers who marked a trail in Philadelphia with flour, which is a typical marking substance and completely benign - unless you put it on the sidewalk in front of the federal mint within recent memory of the anthrax scares.<br/>
<br/>
If you have planted a box on school grounds, you might also give this some thought.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks, and now back to the fun...<br/>
