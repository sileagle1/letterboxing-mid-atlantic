Bill 2224 removes all legal oversight and public participation regarding the sale of public parks, open spaces and farmland and clears the way for municipalities to sell these public assets to private interests. <br/>

FORM LETTER:<br/>
Dear <br/>
Bill 2224 passed through the House under the pretense that it would allow municipalities greater discretion in selling "brownfields" and "under-utilized assets" which were acquired for a purpose that no longer makes practical sense. <br/>
<br/>
However, HB 2224 has little to do with that goal and instead exposes our established parks to sale, regardless of whether they have been publicly used for decades. The bill has been drafted and promoted with little understanding of the law or what is at stake for all Pennsylvanians. <br/>
<br/>
I ask that you reject this legislation in its current form and support alternative legislation that is more carefully crafted and reflects the importance of preserving parks for future generations.<br/>
<br/>
I look forward to hearing how you will act on this matter. <br/>
<br/>
Sincerely,</div>
