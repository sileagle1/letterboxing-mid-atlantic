<br/>
&lt;corny&gt; drum roll please.....<br/>
<br/>
Today is one month til the gathering.  I can't to see you guys again.<br/>
<br/>
I may be asking a bit much here (sorry) but I really need you to <br/>
start seriously thinking about if your going to join us or not.  If <br/>
you have not already RSVP me by email, not this list  p l e a s e  do <br/>
so and tell me how many people you think might be in your party.  I <br/>
know you may not know for sure right now, but please guessimate.<br/>
<br/>
To the people who have already emailed me will you please update the <br/>
totals I have here when you know for sure. I know you may not know <br/>
for sure right now, but please guessimate.<br/>
<br/>
The reason why I am asking is because I will be ordering a huge <br/>
lunchmeat tray with all the fixins and need to have a head count for <br/>
the store by the 9th of October.  <br/>
<br/>

Ryan           1 person<br/>
Irene          1 maybe 2<br/>
Jennifer       2 people<br/>
Judy           1 person<br/>

this was mentioned before on a previous post: the use of <br/>
www.evite.com will help you build a RSVP list. Evite also has the <br/>
ability to list "need to bring items". it free too!<br/>
you can either post it as public event or create a private invite. <br/>
however, if you go the private route you will need a list of email <br/>
addresses of people in the lmba newsgroup.<br/>
with the help of the list owner or moderator you may be able to <br/>
obtain this list. good luck.<br/>
<br/>
another option would be to generate a word document of member's email <br/>
addresses and post it under the Files section. anybody that does not <br/>
mind adding their email addy to the file can download it, edit the <br/>
doc and upload it back to the newsgroup. just a thought.<br/>
