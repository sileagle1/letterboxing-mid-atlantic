I have some stuff I'm working on to make the gather Mayan themed. I am not planning a ton of stuff and was figuring keeping things pretty low key like the other Tyler gathers (that I have been to).  I did want to plant some stuff so the "Tyler veterans" have something to do if they choose.<br/>

I also wanted to make sure no one else was planning on doing a winter gather at Tyler this year. If someone was planning on doing something I would just drop the idea of the gather and just plant the boxes.<br/>

Let me know what you think, 22nd or 29th if interested at all.<br/>

I wanted the 22nd to celebrate the beginning of the 14th Baktun but I knew the date may not be good for some so we will celebrate a week later. Hopefully the date is good for most if not everyone and at least Sheba has a chance of making it. I will post further details on AQ shortly.<br/>
