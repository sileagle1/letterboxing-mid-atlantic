                    <div id="ygrps-yiv-279850602">When I moved to SE Ohio, I was surprised at how many of those pouches are in this area.  It turns out one of the most prolific planters in the area uses them and now every one here thinks that is the norm.  Personally, I am not fond of them.  I agree with MizS that they are messy.  I find that mud and gunk always ends up in under the flap, which is somehow much messier than just on the outside of a box. <br/>
<br/>Plus, most of the time I find it a tight fit for the stamp and logbook so it is very difficult to leave a hitchhiker in a pouch, which means I end up carrying a hitchhiker for much longer (and sometimes end up forgetting I have it once I find an actual box).<br/>
<br/>On the other hand, they are probably a lot cheaper than buying good boxes so maybe it allows more plants? <br/><br/>Katy<br/><div class="ygrps-yiv-279850602gmail_extra"><br/><br/><blockquote><span title="qreply"> <div class="ygrps-yiv-279850602gmail_quote">On Sat, Nov 3, 2012 at 9:35 AM, Elizabeth Thompson <span dir="ltr">&lt;<a href="mailto:zorket@..." rel="nofollow" target="_blank">zorket@...</a>&gt;</span> wrote:<br/>

Let me explain why..... I had a series of boxes planted here, in camoed lock 'n lock containers... Hidden pretty well too.... But not too well, since 90% went missing. Thanks manly to teens hanging in the preserve.  So we switched to the pouches, and only 3 have disappeared.... <br/>
Yes they can be yucky... So can the outside of lock 'n lock boxes.. <br/>

</span></blockquote>In June we vacationed in the Smokies, and down there folks just seem to <br/>
love those pouches.  Don't like them either, they are always messy, <br/>
often wet inside, and too prone to failure.  It is too easy for the <br/>
zipper to break or for it to not be sealed correctly.  The effort to <br/>
make them, to me, seems to outweigh the savings over Lock&amp;Locs, which if <br/>
you hunt around online, you can get at pretty good prices.<br/>

But I am one of the "pouchers" . . . but only when I have to fly - since I also have a very large stash of Dougerware and LnL knockoffs.  But with one checked bag at 50LB, and 7 (Italy) - 30 (AK &amp; PNW) stamps to haul, pouches are my only option.  Oh, and I just left 4 in Austin.   . . . Now where are those clue notes???<br/>
<br/>
One thing I noticed, is that if the duct tape covers the zippy part it is next to impossible to get it to re-zip.  I always leave the zippy part free and make a bigger flip-flap.  Maybe folks shouldn't plant them in the mud!   <br/>
<br/>
But I agree with Zorket -- when I get to the 'box' and it is a pouch, I still want it!  <br/>

Off to Wmsburg and 'sew n sew'.<br/>
