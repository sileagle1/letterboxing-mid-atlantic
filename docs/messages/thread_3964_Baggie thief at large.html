<br/>
What to do, what to do.  I have recently discovered I have a baggie thief on my hands. I checked one of my series yesterday only to discover that my carefully double-bagged logbook and stamp were thrown into 1 bag together and not even shut.  One box was wet inside do to the upside down nature of the container. Grr. Furthermore, other containers were haphazardly thrown back into their hiding spot not carefully hidden at all. <br/>
<br/>
I wrote down the last 4 people in the logbook and am now sending inquiring emails concerning the condition of things when they were there.  I believe I know the culprit, I just don't know what to do about it.  The angry German in me wants to send a scathing email, but what good is that going to do except make me feel better?  The other side of me, I am also a Gemini so I constantly fight with myself (TMI maybe..??) wants to be all nicey-nice and talk about love and respect for other people's work. After all, if it weren't for us, there would be no letterboxes to find so SHOW SOME DAMN RESPECT!  Uh-oh.. angry German coming out... <br/>

                    <div id="ygrps-yiv-1415257320">The anger is understandable but if I were a careless boxer who took offense at an email then I could wreak havoc upon the sender's boxes.  That will surely not make you feel better.<br/>
<br/>
That potential for havoc also suggests that this was a mistake or maybe a muggle-induced rush replacement.  I'm not excusing carelessness but if I wanted to damage a box, I wouldn't stop at a lame single-bagging.<br/>
<br/>
I'm none of the above, by the way (it wasn't me), but I think that the best that you can do is offer a brief, friendly reminder/educational message, possibly with a link to a story about letterboxing courtesies and conventions.<br/>
