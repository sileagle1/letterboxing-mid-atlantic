vacation, but in the last few weeks we had managed to get out a bit more <br/>
and enjoy some more "local" boxes.<br/>
<br/>
It has been nice to get a few mysteries, including being the first <br/>
finder on one, finding a local Brownie troop's box (amazingly, first <br/>
finders there too) as well as a few old classics, like drazzuB Hill, <br/>
which has been well hidden for six years with very few finders. That is <br/>
a shame too, as it is on an excellent hike, just over three miles, that <br/>
includes a very nice waterfall and a great overlook.<br/>
<br/>
It has all really whetted our appetite for more.  Schizokeet wants to <br/>
get out Thanksgiving morning, I am thinking Into The Woods should be a <br/>
nice walk on the way to dinner at the folks place.<br/>
<br/>
I think the mountains are once again calling, and there are boxes hiding <br/>
in them.<br/>
