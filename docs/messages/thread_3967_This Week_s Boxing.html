<br/>
On Thanksgiving morning we left very early and stopped by Brandywine <br/>
Creek State Park to go "Into The Woods."  I had found the series several <br/>
years ago, but Schizokeet had never found it.  It really is a great <br/>
series, and we had fun, even her singing as Rapunzel did each time we <br/>
passed one of the towers.<br/>
<br/>
While there we found "Love Bench" as well as one other box (I rather not <br/>
give it away).  We managed to eke out four miles on the morning.  We <br/>
have been trying to do more.<br/>
<br/>
On the way home from dinner we made a quick stop to find a box hidden in <br/>
the Delaware rest area.  Nice enough box, but no logbook? There was <br/>
plenty of room where it was hidden (even though it was in a hidious <br/>
pouch, at least it is in a protected location), and it is not part of a <br/>
series, so I don't see a reason not to have one.<br/>
<br/>
Today I went looking for "Day Hiker."  It is along an easy stretch of <br/>
the AT out of Keys Gap on the VA/WV boarder.  I found it, the first to <br/>
do so in two years.  Box was in great shape.  The walk was indeed easy, <br/>
with a rewarding view as well.<br/>
<br/>
This leads to something interesting.  We found a HH in DE which I left <br/>
in "Day Hiker."  I did not even look at it until I went to plant it.  <br/>
The HH originated from this area, managed to move around a little here <br/>
before jumping to CA, then very soon back to PA, DE and finally right <br/>
back where it started.  Can't think that that happens too often.<br/>
<br/>
I then made my way to Harpers Ferry where I found a few more boxes, <br/>
including "Screaming Jenny," "The Parable of the Purloined Peaks," and <br/>
"VB Travelin' WV."  I did not do any of the longer hikes there, saving <br/>
that for the next trip, though I did park outside town and walk in, <br/>
roamed around a bit, and stopped at the ATC HQ to have a look.<br/>
<br/>
On the way home I found "My Friend Oscar," with a nice stamp, very cool <br/>
logbook, but a location that, while for the box it made sense, it really <br/>
was just a parking lot box.<br/>
<br/>
It is nice to get back out on the trail, and I feel that I am extending <br/>
myself more each time.  It is also nice to get a few boxes that have <br/>
seen very little in the way of traffic and give them a little love.<br/>
