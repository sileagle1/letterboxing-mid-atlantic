    Campin' n Stampin' is back and just two weeks away at Cunningham
    Falls State Park in Thurmont, MD.<br/>
<br/>
    Camping will be in the Deer Lick Spring Loop of the campground once
    again. I have reserved Site 105. Just look for the T@B trailer
    (hint, hint).<br/>
<br/>
    As of writing, all of the sites and cabins in the loop are booked,
    but there are still a few sites in other parts of the campground.Â 
    Sites can be reserved through the state park's <a href="http://reservations.dnr.state.md.us/camping/Cunningham_Falls_State_Park/r/campgroundDetails.do?contractCode=MD&amp;parkId=380519&amp;topTabIndex=CampingSpot" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">website</a>.<br/>
<br/>
    You <b>DO NOT</b> have to camp to join us for the gathering on
    Saturday.<br/>
<br/>
    The gathering on Saturday will start at 10 at the picnic area near
    the boathouse. This is just off the large parking area just past the
    contact station. Look for the sign.<br/>
<br/>
    There is no pavilion, in the event of rain (and who can forget last
    year) we will relocate to the campground. If you are not camping you
    are welcome in the campground as a guest.<br/>
<br/>
    Please bring a dish to share, meats and eating implements will be
    provided.<br/>
<br/>
    I will be getting a couple of the long hike boxes planted tomorrow,
    on trails where I don't think there are any boxes currently. This
    should make some folks very happy.<br/>
<br/>
    Once I find the stamps (yeah, I know, I should be more organized), I
    will be replanting the gateway series, along with a few other boxes
    just before the gathering. Clues for those will be available last
    minute online, but I will also have clue packets at the gathering
    for folks.<br/>
<br/>
    Just two weeks away now, and looking forward to it!<br/>
