                    <div id="ygrps-yiv-1156970716">Had a nice day yesterday.  Schizokeet and I ventured north to Penns <br/>
Woods to catch up with a  few letterboxers and old friends in Downingtown.<br/>
<br/>
On the way we did grad a couple of drive-bys en route and find one on an <br/>
3½ mile hike, though we looked for several others.  I think we have been <br/>
doing so little letterboxing that we have just simply gotten out of <br/>
practice in finding them, that and they were old boxes that have not <br/>
likely been found in a while.  The hike was nice though, and it was a <br/>
great day to get out on the trail and stumbling over many a rock.<br/>
<br/>
Victory Brewing was our chosen meeting place, set in motion by Mama Wolf <br/>
and the lovely female half of the Seekers from North Carolina. They are <br/>
on a whirlwind trip of their own, letterboxing and visiting friends in <br/>
Philly and then Pittsburgh.<br/>
<br/>
We had a great mix of folks, from states far and wide.  Lightning Bug <br/>
did the footwork of putting it together, and he brought along Dingus <br/>
Dufus, who happened to be in town.  I think I actually met him years ago <br/>
at the gather in Groton when Hikers and Hounds and I did a whirlwind <br/>
trip of our own.<br/>
<br/>
Sheba and Psyker rolled in.  I had not seen Psyker in more then a few <br/>
years, and it was great to catch up in person.<br/>
<br/>
Sir Braemoor, as he is being called now,  meet us at the door, as he was <br/>
there early and already taking on a few pints.  I am not sure he <br/>
actually paid for any more drinks himself that afternoon.<br/>
<br/>
Finally, I got to meet Aiphid, the eeeevil genius, and the quiet Crafty <br/>
Lobster.  I had had a traveling box of his that fell into the black hole <br/>
of my down stairs room for sometime, which I think Sheba had pawned off <br/>
on my, and I got the chance to pawn back to him, so the circle is now <br/>
complete.<br/>
<br/>
We all talked about everything under the sun, life, beer politics, <br/>
letterboxing, and more letterboxing.  I had not been doing much at all, <br/>
having not planted a box in over a year, which I still have to write <br/>
clues for, and not really finding many of late either.  Heck, we were in <br/>
Florida for two weeks a few months ago and only walked away with one box <br/>
on a short walk.  It really kinda reinvigorated me.  I have clues to <br/>
write, boxes to find, and ideas to implement, and it was great to get <br/>
together with other folks, some of whom are a little burned out to, and <br/>
get the juices flowing again.<br/>
<br/>
Afterwards we set out to slackbox Stone Soup, a close by Lightning Bug <br/>
box.  There we old first, second and third generation letterboxers <br/>
showed to he true meaning of stealth, compass coordination, and and <br/>
respect for parkland that had been trod upon and dug up a thousand times <br/>
before.<br/>
<br/>
It was a great day, long, with a lot of driving for us, but it was <br/>
wonderful to get out and enjoy the company of some great friends, as <br/>
well as make a few new ones.<br/>

coordinate.  The Lion's share of the credit goes to Mama Wolf and Dina 
of the Seekers.<br/><br/>The Middle Atlantic does represent without 
"attitude". Like Cyclonic mentioned, it was good to see boxers from 6 
states (NC², DE, VA², ME², MA, and PA³) just sitting and talking box.  
No event stamp, no cooties no exclusion, no blogs.  Just boxers talking 
about shared experiences and fun.<br/><br/>LB</div>
