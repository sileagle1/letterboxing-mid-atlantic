Stamps where the sponge type that you use for crafts.  It was <br/>
definitely different.  Totally enjoyed the walk.  Now that I have <br/>
Saturday's and Sunday's off, I think I'll be able to get out and box <br/>
more.<br/>
<br/>
I've lost my partner though, he works weekends now.  I have my eye on <br/>
the King of the Hill series in Annandale if anyone else wants to meet <br/>
sometime this fall and do some boxes in that area, let me know.  If <br/>
not, I'll see y'all and the Clue gathering.<br/>
