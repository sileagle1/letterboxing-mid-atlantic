<br/>
While today was a gorgeuos day for hiking in Tyler Park, it was not <br/>
a very successful day for Hikers &amp; Hounds letterboxing efforts. We <br/>
searched for two of Muk-Luk's boxes but found niether! We still had <br/>
a great time hiking and the hounds had a good workout. I'll have to <br/>
email Muk-Luk offline for some help! Anyway, don't forgot to check <br/>
out our Treasure Hunt series at Neshaminy State Park and we should <br/>
be posting clues tomorrow for the 3 Grateful Dead boxes we planted <br/>
in Greenville, DE last weekend. Just get out there and box!</div>

BUT, if you liked the Treasure Hunt boxes and that park, wait til you see our Grateful Dead boxes in one of the most beautiful parks in our area, Valley Garden Park in Delaware. They will knock your socks off! Only 20 minutes off of I-95, go there too!!</div>

I have found your Neshaminy Park boxes, very well done.  I hope to <br/>
plant my first box in Neshaminy in the next few weeks as well, as <br/>
soon as I get the chance to make a stamp.<br/>
