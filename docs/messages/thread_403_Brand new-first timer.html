Where are you folks located? What state or area? Yes,<br/>
there are lot's of places for clues other than<br/>
Letterboxing.org but you pretty have to find them<br/>
yourself for the most part. I'm not being deliberately<br/>
cryptic but folks who don't post their clues on the<br/>
website usually want you to have to figure out how to<br/>
find them, such as search the internet, etc. I only<br/>
use the website so can be no help to you with that. <br/>

We're in Southeastern VA--really just a few minutes' drive from any <br/>
of the Golden's Brainteasers boxes.  I have to say we're in that <br/>
giddy "honeymoon" phase of letterboxing--can't wait to find some <br/>
more!<br/>

around 60-65 finds and about 24 plants, and we have<br/>

The lbna site is "the big one", but there's a new one going now too, <br/>
(quick, Doug, what's the name of Ryan's site?)<br/>
AND, when lbna changed the site to a database format a while ago, a <br/>
bunch of clues didn't get switched over, and were put in <br/>
the "basemant" at:<br/>
<a href="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/letterbox-basement/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://groups.yahoo.com/group/letterbox-basement/</a><br/>
There's a greater risk of finding clues to missing boxes there, as <br/>
if the placer didn't bother moving the clues, there's a chance they <br/>
aren't even boxing anymore and the boxes aren't maintained, either, <br/>
but there are some great "old" boxes there, too.<br/>
