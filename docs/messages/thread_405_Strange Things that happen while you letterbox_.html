while you box, but how about tstrange things happening at home while <br/>
you are out boxing?<br/>
<br/>
Team Lightnin' Bug had yet another strange encounter with insects!<br/>
<br/>
Here's the tale...<br/>
<br/>
My father in law (FIL) does wood carvings and wood turnings.  <br/>
Collecters tend to value odd looking patterns in wood such as burls, <br/>
etc.  He recently found a piece that had been invaded by forest ants, <br/>
the kind that can eat wood.  So it had all sort of cool holes.  He <br/>
usually turns these into bowls.  Anyway, he figured out a way to 'de-<br/>
green' (dry) freshly cut wood by cooking it in a microwave after the <br/>
piece is carved.  He had a particularly large piece that did not fit <br/>
in his microwave oven, so Mrs. LB offered to nuke this wood bowl for <br/>
him in our larger microwave.  She'd zap it for 1 minute, then 2 and <br/>
so on to get a feel for the process.  After about 1 hour of this she <br/>
notices that the holes in the wood started to have ants crawling out <br/>
of them.  She tries to get them, but they crawl back in the hole <br/>
before she can grab one!  It was kind of like playing 'whack a mole' <br/>
with ants in a bowl.  We left the bowl out last night in the 45 <br/>
degree cool post-Ivan weather to freeze em out.<br/>
<br/>
I am not sure that there will be any more microwave treatments of the <br/>
bowl in the near future.<br/>
<br/>
Arrgh!  &lt;-Obligatory Piratism for today<br/>

given away as a gift and someone USED it! Can you<br/>
imagine? "Please, try my wonderful beef stroganoff..<br/>
what?.. there's WHAT crawling around in it!!<br/>
AHHHHHH!!!!" Could be pretty funny actually!<br/>
