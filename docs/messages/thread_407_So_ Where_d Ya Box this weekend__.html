<br/>
Hargh!  Did you all have fun boxing this weekend?<br/>
<br/>
On Saturday Team Lightnin' Bug met up with the Amanda from Seattle to <br/>
hand off some scurvy hitchhikers for our "Not so Great Hitchhiker <br/>
Race" and with the Top Dawg from Hikers and Houndz (Irene) to talk <br/>
shop, do the handoff and hunt down two Mystery Boxes in Joisey.  We <br/>
could not locate NJ Maritime Mystery #1 (our first ever bust - boo <br/>
hoo!), but we are certain we had the right spot.  We redeemed ourself <br/>
on NJ Maritime Mystery #2.  Irene was stoked that she finally had a <br/>
box that the illustrious Silent Doug had not yet found!<br/>
<br/>
Today, Dad went solo to Stash the Fibonnacci Treegonometree and the <br/>
Zuflucht Haus.  The first is a mystery box that you all have been <br/>
getting clues for Foxworthy Style.  The second is a very <br/>
staightforward box in Emmaus, PA.<br/>
<br/>
Hope your weekend was as much fun as ours!<br/>
