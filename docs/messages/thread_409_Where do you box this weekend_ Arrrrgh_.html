a little damp but due to the woderful double bagging nothing was <br/>
damaged.  I dumped out the water and tried to dry it as best I could <br/>

"Hungry Termites"'s box lid seemed to be on tight so I don't know <br/>
how water got in...Ivan had a way to get water everywhere.  No <br/>
worries about looking out for your box.  Glad I could get it before <br/>
it moves to Michigan.<br/>

new box with me just incase when I do box maintenace. Yeah, that Ivan <br/>

&gt; "Hungry Termites"'s box lid seemed to be on tight so I don't know <br/>

&gt; &gt; Thanks for the compliment on the Hungry Termites stamp! Also <br/>
&gt; thanks <br/>
&gt; &gt; for letting me know the condition of the box and drying it out <br/>
for <br/>
&gt; &gt; me. I really appreciate it! So you said that there was water in <br/>
&gt; the <br/>
&gt; &gt; box itself? I wonder how that happened? Was the area that it was <br/>
&gt; in <br/>
&gt; &gt; flooded at all? I just checked on the box on Friday. I made sure <br/>
&gt; the <br/>
&gt; &gt; lid was on good and tight. I will stop by later this week and do <br/>
&gt; some <br/>
&gt; &gt; box maintenance as needed. Thanks again for looking out for my <br/>
&gt; box. <br/>
&gt; &gt; For anyone who has not found the Hungry Termites box yet, it is <br/>
&gt; only <br/>
&gt; &gt; going to be available until November. After that time, it is <br/>
&gt; moving <br/>
&gt; &gt; to Michigan with me. Have a great night and happy letterboxing.<br/>

&gt; &gt; &gt; Today was an absolutely fabulous day to go letterboxing.  I <br/>
&gt; managed <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; to make my way down from Bergen County, NJ to Nockamixon Lake <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; inorder to search for the LoTR series.  To The Raindears and <br/>
H&amp;H <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; wonderful series.  Loved all the hikes and surroundings. And <br/>
you <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; will be happy to know that all are alive and well and survived <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; Ivan.  On my way down to Nockamixon I stopped by to pick up <br/>
&gt; Rahway <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; River.  First one for that box..woohoo.  I was busy today and <br/>
&gt; also <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; found "Jump for Joy" and "Hungry Termites".   Both alive and <br/>
&gt; well.  <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; Can I just tell you how much I LOVED Cichlid Guy's stamp <br/>
&gt; &gt; for "Hungry <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; Termites".  I do have to say though "Hungry Termites " outer <br/>
box <br/>
&gt; &gt; was <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; a little damp but due to the woderful double bagging nothing <br/>
was <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; damaged.  I dumped out the water and tried to dry it as best I <br/>
&gt; &gt; could <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; with my T-shirt.  On my way back to "Joisey" I stopped off at <br/>
&gt; the <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; NJAA Observatory to collect "Starry Night".  Again alive and <br/>
&gt; well.<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; All in all it was a very successful day today. Arrgh!<br/>
