                    <div id="ygrps-yiv-1716055759">We only found the first box in this series.  When we were putting it back,<br/>
my 6 yo stumbled into a nest of bees/wasps and they took after her big time.<br/>
She got stung at least 7 times that I counted and was extremely hysterical<br/>
so we had to head home.<br/>
<br/>
There was a warning about wasps in the log book, but being the usually<br/>
clueless person I am didn't put 2 and 2 together until my baby was screaming<br/>
and running away in a panic.  I can't remember who planted this series<br/>
(sorry!), but would it be possible to place a warning directly on the clues?<br/>
The nest is in the ground and really isn't visible unless you are looking<br/>
for it.<br/>
<br/>
I'm looking forward to going back - it sure looked like a nice walk!<br/>
