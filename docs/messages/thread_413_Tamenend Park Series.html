Irene, The Brave Little Caterpiller series was a lot of fun.  We did spend a<br/>
few (okay... about a half hour) trying to start from in front of the Farm<br/>
House instead of the office, but once we figured out the mistake we were on<br/>
our way.  We were the first ones to find the series, just as you suspected.<br/>
<br/>
We found #1 and #4-7 a-okay. #2 is definitely missing in action - all we<br/>
found was the burlap wrapped around the end of a stick. :(<br/>
<br/>
I can't say that #3 is missing for sure, we were having a little trouble<br/>
with the clues.  We couldn't find the rock with moss on it, but assumed we<br/>
should look on the path between #2 &amp; #4.  We saw two paths "with a small log<br/>
across it", but couldn't see "a large tree with grey-white bark".  Guess we<br/>
should have brought that tree id book along as my son suggested - we don't<br/>
have any idea what a Birch or Ash tree looks like either. ;)  We did look<br/>
around two trees that had logs at the base, but didn't find anything.<br/>
<br/>
It was a completely successful hunt, though, in the kids eyes.  The story<br/>
was wonderful and the stamps were cute.  Their favorite by far was the<br/>
spider - I just finished reading Charlotte's Web out loud to my 6 yo.  THANK<br/>
YOU!<br/>

<br/>
"The Brave Little Caterpillar" box #2 is gone as in<br/>

get at all. It was there this afternoon for you guys<br/>
and all of the sticks and stuff are in place. I was<br/>

I am going to call the park Director tomorrow to see<br/>
if he has any clue where any of them might be. <br/>

In the meantime I am pulling the clues from the<br/>
website as the series makes no sense without box #7.<br/>
Box #3 is still there but I need to make the clues<br/>
clearer.<br/>
<br/>
Of my 24 plants, Tim's box and box #2 are my first<br/>
ever to go missing. I honestly thought they were<br/>
pretty well hidden but I knew these boxes would be<br/>
tricky. I specifically planted them right off of the<br/>
trail so that the kids could find them easily and the<br/>
park would not complain about off-trail damage. I am<br/>
really surprised box #2 went missing as I thought that<br/>
was a pretty good spot. <br/>
<br/>
Oh well. For now the series is pulled. <br/>

Thank you Elizabeth for all of your helpful feedback.<br/>
I hope your little one is okay again real soon.<br/>

&gt; &gt; &gt; didn't find anything.<br/>

&gt;   Well, I went up to the park after work and "The<br/>
&gt;   Raindears" box is gone. I am so sorry, Tim and<br/>
&gt; girls.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt;   "The Brave Little Caterpillar" box #2 is gone as<br/>
&gt; in<br/>
&gt;   now also box #7 with the log in it! This one I<br/>
&gt; don't<br/>
&gt;   get at all. It was there this afternoon for you<br/>
&gt; guys<br/>
&gt;   and all of the sticks and stuff are in place. I<br/>
&gt; was<br/>
&gt;   shocked that it wasn't there.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt;   I am going to call the park Director tomorrow to<br/>
&gt; see<br/>
&gt;   if he has any clue where any of them might be.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt;   In the meantime I am pulling the clues from the<br/>
&gt;   website as the series makes no sense without box<br/>
&gt; #7.<br/>
&gt;   Box #3 is still there but I need to make the clues<br/>

&gt; &gt; there earlier today. I'm not sure what I'll do<br/>
&gt; about<br/>
&gt; &gt; this series. It was inspired by the stamps I found<br/>
&gt; on<br/>
&gt; &gt; sale at a little craft place in Maryland. If the<br/>
&gt; boxes<br/>
&gt; &gt; go missing do I bother to re-purchase a stamp that<br/>
&gt; &gt; doesn't match the series? Last night I went a<br/>
&gt; bought a<br/>
&gt; &gt; little bee for $3.99!!! The original was just 50�!<br/>
&gt; I<br/>
&gt; &gt; may just let the series shrink as the boxes go<br/>
&gt; &gt; missing. I don't know. <br/>

&gt; &gt; &gt; with my son - we found it and replaced it behind<br/>
&gt; the<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; tree that was behind<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; the spigot.  Does that help?<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; It would break my heart to think we were<br/>

&gt; &gt; &gt;   Well, I went up to the park after work and<br/>
&gt; "The<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;   Raindears" box is gone. I am so sorry, Tim and<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; girls.<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;   "The Brave Little Caterpillar" box #2 is gone<br/>
&gt; as<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; in<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;   now also box #7 with the log in it! This one I<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; don't<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;   get at all. It was there this afternoon for<br/>
&gt; you<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; guys<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;   and all of the sticks and stuff are in place.<br/>
&gt; I<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; was<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;   shocked that it wasn't there.<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;   I am going to call the park Director tomorrow<br/>
&gt; to<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; see<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;   if he has any clue where any of them might be.<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;   In the meantime I am pulling the clues from<br/>
&gt; the<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;   website as the series makes no sense without<br/>
&gt; box<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; #7.<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;   Box #3 is still there but I need to make the<br/>
&gt; clues<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;   clearer.<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;   Of my 24 plants, Tim's box and box #2 are my<br/>
&gt; first<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;   ever to go missing. I honestly thought they<br/>
&gt; were<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;   pretty well hidden but I knew these boxes<br/>
&gt; would be<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;   tricky. I specifically planted them right off<br/>
&gt; of<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; the<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;   trail so that the kids could find them easily<br/>
&gt; and<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; the<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;   park would not complain about off-trail<br/>
&gt; damage. I<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; am<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;   really surprised box #2 went missing as I<br/>
&gt; thought<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; that<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;   was a pretty good spot.<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;   Oh well. For now the series is pulled.<br/>

&gt; &gt; &gt;   Thank you Elizabeth for all of your helpful<br/>

&gt; &gt; &gt;   &gt; Irene, The Brave Little Caterpiller series<br/>
&gt; was a<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; lot<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;   &gt; of fun.  We did spend a<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;   &gt; few (okay... about a half hour) trying to<br/>
&gt; start<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; from<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;   &gt; in front of the Farm<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;   &gt; House instead of the office, but once we<br/>
&gt; figured<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; out<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;   &gt; the mistake we were on<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;   &gt; our way.  We were the first ones to find the<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; series,<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;   &gt; just as you suspected.<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;   &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;   &gt; We found #1 and #4-7 a-okay. #2 is<br/>
&gt; definitely<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;   &gt; missing in action - all we<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;   &gt; found was the burlap wrapped around the end<br/>
&gt; of a<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;   &gt; stick. :(<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;   &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;   &gt; I can't say that #3 is missing for sure, we<br/>
&gt; were<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;   &gt; having a little trouble<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;   &gt; with the clues.  We couldn't find the rock<br/>
&gt; with<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; moss<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;   &gt; on it, but assumed we<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;   &gt; should look on the path between #2 &amp; #4.  We<br/>
&gt; saw<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; two<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;   &gt; paths "with a small log<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;   &gt; across it", but couldn't see "a large tree<br/>
&gt; with<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;   &gt; grey-white bark".  Guess we<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;   &gt; should have brought that tree id book along<br/>
&gt; as<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; my<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;   &gt; son suggested - we don't<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;   &gt; have any idea what a Birch or Ash tree looks<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; like<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;   &gt; either. ;)  We did look<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;   &gt; around two trees that had logs at the base,<br/>
&gt; but<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;   &gt; didn't find anything.<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;   &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;   &gt; It was a completely successful hunt, though,<br/>
&gt; in<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; the<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;   &gt; kids eyes.  The story<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;   &gt; was wonderful and the stamps were cute. <br/>
&gt; Their<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;   &gt; favorite by far was the<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;   &gt; spider - I just finished reading Charlotte's<br/>
&gt; Web<br/>

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; on it, but assumed we<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; should look on the path between #2 &amp; #4.  We saw<br/>
&gt; &gt; two<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; paths "with a small log<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; across it", but couldn't see "a large tree with<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; grey-white bark".  Guess we<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; should have brought that tree id book along as<br/>
&gt; &gt; my<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; son suggested - we don't<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; have any idea what a Birch or Ash tree looks<br/>
&gt; &gt; like<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; either. ;)  We did look<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; around two trees that had logs at the base, but<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; didn't find anything.<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; It was a completely successful hunt, though, in<br/>
&gt; &gt; the<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; kids eyes.  The story<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; was wonderful and the stamps were cute.  Their<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; favorite by far was the<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; spider - I just finished reading Charlotte's Web<br/>
&gt; &gt; out<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; loud to my 6 yo.  THANK<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; YOU!<br/>
