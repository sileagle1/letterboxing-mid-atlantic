Golden's Brainteasers 1, 2 and 3 are alive and well, but we couldn't <br/>
find 4.  I'm pretty sure we were in the right place, but it was cold <br/>
and raining and the four-year-old had had enough.  Besides, a group <br/>
of foreign tourists showed up (why?) so we split.<br/>
We also walked the Noland Trail for the Mariners Museum series.  We <br/>
found 1 (no stamp) and 2 (REALLY confusing clues--I must have done <br/>
something wrong) but couldn't find 3 or 4.  3 we probably walked <br/>
right by but we looked hard for 4--I wonder if it survived the <br/>
hurricane(s)?  Anyway, we're hooked.  Even the four year old, who <br/>
walked about four of the five miles of the Noland trail even without <br/>
her nap, is anxious to do it again!</div>
