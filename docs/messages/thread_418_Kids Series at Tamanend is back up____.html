I replaced box #2 in a slightly different spot. Box #7<br/>
was all safe and sound and very well re-hidden by<br/>
Momma Fishy's brood. It was just a little beyond where<br/>
I had put it and between the darkness and the<br/>
camoflage I couldn't find it last night! Yes, I<br/>
actually couldn't find my own box. Tim's "Raindeers"<br/>
box is most definately gone. I take responsibility for<br/>
not hiding it well enough. Again, I was thinking about<br/>
little kids hunting. Mean people suck. <br/>
<br/>
Remember, folks the kids series are store bought.<br/>
But's Tim's 2 remaining boxes, Dobby and Cat in the<br/>
Hat are very nicely carved by his girls. And it really<br/>
is a beautiful park.<br/>
<br/>
Take a box to plant while you're there if you can but<br/>
I suggest you go well back on trail. There's lot's of<br/>
places in lower traffic areas. Just email Tony the<br/>
clues at <a href="mailto:parknrec@..." rel="nofollow" target="_blank">parknrec@...</a>. That way he'll know<br/>
they're there should anyone on his staff stumble<br/>
across it by accident.<br/>

Again, I can't apoogize enough. I felt at the time I<br/>
had found a good compromise between well hidden and<br/>
easy access for kids. But in retrospect I did not hide<br/>
it well enough. I am glad it will be replaced. It was<br/>
a good stamp and a great example to other kids (heck<br/>
adults to!) who are hesitant to try carving their own<br/>
stamps. <br/>

Don't worry about it.<br/>
It just bugs me that I have lost so many boxes lately.<br/>
I don't think it matters who hid it or even where.<br/>
I have at least 5 now missing that I have to think about whether or not to<br/>
replace.<br/>
I'll get carving this week and try to get them ready.<br/>
