others know where it is too, from figuring the clues out. <br/>
<br/>
I personally would not give away the location, since the allure of it <br/>
is that it's a tough box to crack, although ultimately it's Randy <br/>
Hall's decision. Hell, I'll carve a HH and put it up there, since I <br/>
don't really care if it's one of mine floundering for months in there.<br/>

<br/>
It is much better to figure it out.  After a smidge of a hint of a <br/>
clue, I was able to figure out where Homage and the Mad Hatter H³ <br/>
are.  It was really fun to solve it.  I had tried a few times with <br/>
FdL over the summer and kind of gave up.  I agree with FdL and Natty, <br/>
as some things are best left a secret.<br/>
<br/>
Finding them seems like it would be a average hike, but one I would <br/>
not want to take little gremlins on.  Soooo, I am wondering if <br/>
anyboady wants to meet up and co-conspire.  I amnot sure when I can <br/>
get away to actually do it, but am looking for offers.  Anything is <br/>
contingent upon familial obligations and gatherings, of course!!<br/>
<br/>
There are a couple other boxes nearby that may make it worthwhile.<br/>
