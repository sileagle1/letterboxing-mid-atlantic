                    <div id="ygrps-yiv-655066328">Today, I retrieved "Captain Moore's Insignia" from it's hiding place <br/>
near the Canal at Washinton Crossing, Bucks county, PA. It seems I <br/>
placed the box in an area recently designated "Private Property". <br/>
I'll find a new place for it in a week or so and the clues will be <br/>
posted on this website, as well as the LbNA site.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks to a tip from"Raindear", I put "Victory" in a new box in it's <br/>
same location. Apparently somebody, or something, tried to shred the <br/>
side of the first box.<br/>
