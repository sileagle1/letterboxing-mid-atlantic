<div><font face="Arial" family="SANSSERIF" size="2">***************************************************<br/>I agree with the rest of you, and after really reading Mapsurfer's site, it seems he really likes his boxes to be a puzzle.  I figure it never hurts to ask what everyone else thinks about it.</font></div><font face="Arial" family="SANSSERIF" size="2"></font></div>
<div><font face="Arial" family="SANSSERIF" size="2">I would love to get together to conspire with you Lightnin'.  I don't really know when, but there are a few more boxes up there as well that may take some collaboration to get.
