Not sure what you are planning to conspire on, but I am still in the market<br/>
for such activity.<br/>
Family obligations come first of course.<br/>

Hi All!<br/>
<br/>
It is much better to figure it out.  After a smidge of a hint of a <br/>
clue, I was able to figure out where Homage and the Mad Hatter H³ <br/>
are.  It was really fun to solve it.  I had tried a few times with <br/>
FdL over the summer and kind of gave up.  I agree with FdL and Natty, <br/>
as some things are best left a secret.<br/>
<br/>
Finding them seems like it would be a average hike, but one I would <br/>
not want to take little gremlins on.  Soooo, I am wondering if <br/>
anyboady wants to meet up and co-conspire.  I amnot sure when I can <br/>
get away to actually do it, but am looking for offers.  Anything is <br/>
contingent upon familial obligations and gatherings, of course!!<br/>
<br/>
There are a couple other boxes nearby that may make it worthwhile.<br/>
