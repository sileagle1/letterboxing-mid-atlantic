Got that last letterbox from hanging over my head. NJ Physiography <br/>
104 is safe in its new home and the clues are up. Am I the only one <br/>
who feels this kind of pressure? I'm (in my vanity, I suppose) <br/>
imagining a whole hoard of you with either the 105 or 103 boxes <br/>
done, sitting at home fuming over having to wait a week for the next <br/>
one. Right.<br/>
Got a few more finds from the other end of the state while we were <br/>
there, too.<br/>
