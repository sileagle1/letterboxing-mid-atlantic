<div> </div>
<div>Went down to South Jersey and found the following:</div>
<div>Bayonet Farm </div>
<div>Hartshorn Woods Park- only found 4 out of 6</div>
<div>Rosehill Cemetary (box was wet, logbook very damp- outer bag had been chewed by an animal)  We repaired as best as we could.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>We tried but had no luck in finding the Holmdel Arboretum box (not sure we were looking in the right place).</div>
<div>Also tried The Spy House- this seemed to be missing as we're sure we were in the right place.</div>
<div>In Hartshorn Woods one box appeared to be MIA but the other was probably there but eluding us- we couldn't find the landmark given.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>All in all a great day.  Hope you enjoyed it as well.</div>
