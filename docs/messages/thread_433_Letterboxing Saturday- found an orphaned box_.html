                    <div id="ygrps-yiv-1556985362">Well, I went out and found me some letterboxes today.  I went to Lake <br/>
Anna State Park in Spotsylvania, VA.  Something interesting <br/>
happened.  I found the letterbox I was looking for and I recognized <br/>
that it would be a good place for a geocache, so I started looking <br/>
around.  I left my GPS and all the coordinates at home so I could <br/>
concentrate on boxing.  I didn't find a geocache, but I found another <br/>
letterbox.  If I remember correctly, it was about 2 years old.  I was <br/>
the first person to sign in because the clues aren't posted <br/>
anywhere.  The box is in okay shape.  Unfortunately, the placed <br/>
wrapped it in Duct Tape, probably to keep critters from chewing it.  <br/>
The note in it said that it was a replacement box for the one the <br/>
critters ate.  So, I'm thinking she took the clues down, replaced the <br/>
box, and then never posted the clues again.  The duct tape has done a <br/>
number on the container, which is a tiny gladware container.  The log <br/>
book was damp. I carry snack sized ziploc bags with me, so I did a <br/>
little bit of first aid to it. <br/>
<br/>
Have you ever stumbled upon a letterbox.  This box is less than 50 <br/>
feet from another box, but I know it was there first.  The other <br/>
boxes in the park planted by this boxer have been adopted by Scarab, <br/>
so I'm assuming that she no longer boxes.  I'm going to try and <br/>
contact the placer.  If I don't find her, would it be a no no to post <br/>
the clues for this box and adopt it?<br/>
<br/>
Besides those two, I found 1 other in the park.  I tried to find <br/>
another "over the river and through the woods".  But after walking 2 <br/>
miles I still didn't see a posted sign in the clues, so I'm thinking <br/>
I wasn't in the write place.  I was tired and went home.  I may go <br/>
out tomorrow with my boyfriend, get the other two boxes and caches in <br/>
the park.<br/>
<br/>
I had fun, and I am POOPED.  I walked about 7 miles total.  There was <br/>
a triathalon going on in the park so it was slow getting about.<br/>
<br/>
Lemme know what you think about that box?</div>

you adopted?  I found tombstone, which was in a mess, purple ink <br/>
EVERYWHERE.  I cleaned it out and rebagged everything.  I also found <br/>
the Ant's Tower.  I looked for Over the River and through the woods, <br/>
one of your adopted boxes, but I never found it.  I never found the <br/>
yellow posted sign that read "boundary".  SO I tried to do the clues <br/>
from the wooden bridge.  I think I was on the right trail, it <br/>
went "around the lake".  I didn't really understand the Elvin trail <br/>
clue.  At first, I started out on a "Glendora" trail, but it didn't <br/>
go around the lake, so I went to the railroad one.  I'll go back and <br/>
find it.  Maybe tomorrow.  Probably not though.  I was SOOOO tired by <br/>
time I left.<br/>
<br/>
The name of the box I found was "little redneck riding hood" as far <br/>
as I can tell.  Sound familiar?  It was written on a ziploc bag that <br/>
the letterbox was in.  <br/>

 the box I found was "little redneck riding hood" as far <br/>as I can tell.  Sound familiar?  It was written on a ziploc bag that <br/>the letterbox was in.  <br/><br/>manda<br/><br/>--- In lbma@yahoogroups.com, The Doubtful Guests <br/>&lt;thedoubtfulguests@y...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; I am really excited that you found the Lake Anna boxes.  What <br/>exactly did you find?  <br/>&gt;  <br/>&gt; If you live near there and want to adopt any of the Spotsylvania <br/>boxes that I adopted I would be happy for you to do so.  I only <br/>adopted them so they wouldn't disappear.  I haven't even been able to <br/>get down to look for them.  Too many family obligations.  <br/>&gt;  <br/>&gt; Was there any infomation in the 'mystery' box about who placed it?  <br/>I don't see any reason you shouldn't write up clues for it and post <br/>them with a note that you found and adopted it.  Stumbling across it <br/>is a good story to include.  Are you
 sure it's not a WOM or mystery <br/>box?  I assume you're right because of the duct tape and empty log.  <br/>&gt;  <br/>&gt; I seem to remember hearing that someone planted a box in Lake Anna <br/>and then didn't get the clues posted for a long time and then forgot <br/>where it was.  But this could have been anywhere, really.  <br/>&gt;  <br/>&gt; Scarab<br/>&gt; <br/>&gt; Manda &lt;manda@a...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; Well, I went out and found me some letterboxes today.  I went to <br/>Lake <br/>&gt; Anna State Park in Spotsylvania, VA.  Something interesting <br/>&gt; happened.  I found the letterbox I was looking for and I recognized <br/>&gt; that it would be a good place for a geocache, so I started looking <br/>&gt; around.  I left my GPS and all the coordinates at home so I could <br/>&gt; concentrate on boxing.  I didn't find a geocache, but I found <br/>another <br/>&gt; letterbox.  If I remember correctly, it was about 2 years
 old.  I <br/>was <br/>&gt; the first person to sign in because the clues aren't posted <br/>&gt; anywhere.  The box is in okay shape.  Unfortunately, the placed <br/>&gt; wrapped it in Duct Tape, probably to keep critters from chewing <br/>it.  <br/>&gt; The note in it said that it was a replacement box for the one the <br/>&gt; critters ate.  So, I'm thinking she took the clues down, replaced <br/>the <br/>&gt; box, and then never posted the clues again.  The duct tape has done <br/>a <br/>&gt; number on the container, which is a tiny gladware container.  The <br/>log <br/>&gt; book was damp. I carry snack sized ziploc bags with me, so I did a <br/>&gt; little bit of first aid to it. <br/>&gt; <br/>&gt; Have you ever stumbled upon a letterbox.  This box is less than 50 <br/>&gt; feet from another box, but I know it was there first.  The other <br/>&gt; boxes in the park planted by this boxer have been adopted by <br/>Scarab, <br/>&gt; so I'm assuming that
 she no longer boxes.  I'm going to try and <br/>&gt; contact the placer.  If I don't find her, would it be a no no to <br/>post <br/>&gt; the clues for this box and adopt it?<br/>&gt; <br/>&gt; Besides those two, I found 1 other in the park.  I tried to find <br/>&gt; another "over the river and through the woods".  But after walking <br/>2 <br/>&gt; miles I still didn't see a posted sign in the clues, so I'm <br/>thinking <br/>&gt; I wasn't in the write place.  I was tired and went home.  I may go <br/>&gt; out tomorrow with my boyfriend, get the other two boxes and caches <br/>in <br/>&gt; the park.<br/>&gt; <br/>&gt; I had fun, and I am POOPED.  I walked about 7 miles total.  There <br/>was <br/>&gt; a triathalon going on in the park so it was slow getting about.<br/>&gt; <br/>&gt; Lemme know what you think about that box?<br/>&gt; <br/>&gt; <br/>&gt; Yahoo!

                    <div id="ygrps-yiv-1989601107">For those not familiar with letterbox-basement, that group is <br/>
basically a "message database" of clues that were unclaimed (neither <br/>
the original owner created an account nor did anyone else adopt the <br/>
clue) during the changeover from webmaster-entered clues to box <br/>
owner-entered clues. That process was ongoing for most of 2003 with <br/>
the unclaimed clues finally being purged from the site and into the <br/>
basement in the fall.<br/>
<br/>
My opinion is that any letterbox that wound up in the basement is <br/>
absolutely abandoned. If the owner didn't participate in the <br/>
changeover process themselves, then they are almost certainly out of <br/>
the letterboxing hobby now. There might be an exception out there, <br/>
but I doubt it.<br/>
<br/>
My opinion is that you should either adopt that lEtterbox or clean <br/>
that lItterbox out of the woods.<br/>
