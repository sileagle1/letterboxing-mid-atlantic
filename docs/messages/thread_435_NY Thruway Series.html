<br/>
If you have yet to visit the Western NY region, here's a reason! <br/>
Interstate 90, the New York Thruway, has 8 of the best boxes we've <br/>
ever SEEN between Buffalo and Syracuse! We were so impressed with the <br/>
two we found, we must have giggled like school kids for 10 minutes in <br/>
the car at each one. We can't wait to take a trip further east to get <br/>
the rest. <br/>
<br/>
The Elba Onions are an ingenious group that's responsible for a good <br/>
portion of the boxes in the Western New York area, including a some <br/>
great historic cemetary series', so it's no wonder they're at it <br/>
again giving us a great search while teaching us local history. <br/>
<br/>
Anyway, it's another reason to visit...come on out for pizza, wings <br/>
and a little letterboxing!<br/>

</span></blockquote>Just a note -- you cross-posted the same message to at least 5 or 6 <br/>
different letterboxing discussion lists. Most people consider cross-posting <br/>
a no-no, except in very particular circumstances, and the practice of <br/>
cross-posting can quite possibly irk some recipients, particularly if the <br/>
topic of the message isn't of specific interest to that group. Northern NY <br/>
State is only marginally part of the Mid-Atlantic region, so this message <br/>
probably would have been better off not being posted to our Mid-Atlantic <br/>
group, IMHO. I just don't want you to start getting heat from some of the <br/>
hot-blooded letterboxers out there for cross-posting, which has been known <br/>
to happen. Repeated cross-posting has also gotten people banned from some <br/>
message boards.<br/>
<br/>
Having said that, I was the first finder of three of those boxes over the <br/>
weekend, since I happened to be on a trip to Buffalo from Philly. I found 6 <br/>
of the 8 altogether; 1 of the others had an unclear clue and the other 1 <br/>
may be missing already. They were interesting from the perspective of how <br/>
to retrieve a letterbox in a highly-trafficked area in broad daylight <br/>
without looking suspicious, so I had to variously walk around, talk on my <br/>
cell phone, tie my shoelaces (oops, I was wearing loafers, so I adjusted my <br/>
socks or pretended like I had rocks in one of my shoes) as I knelt by the <br/>
location, wait for people to finish their ice cream or hamburgers and move <br/>
out of the area, etc., all while trying to get a visual bead on the <br/>
letterbox and then find the precise moment to casually reach down or up and <br/>
grab it. The trick was to not look like I was doing anything suspicious or <br/>
that I was looking for something, but as I watched what other people were <br/>
doing at a service plaza on the thruway, it became clear that lots of <br/>
people were stretching their legs, pacing around, hanging out by their <br/>
cars, waiting for friends or family to use the restrooms inside, so nothing <br/>
that I was doing was any different -- or at least appeared that way to <br/>
anybody who happened to be watching. (I also had to cope with the way that <br/>
a couple of women were watching me, which led me to believe that I could <br/>
have also gotten a couple of phone numbers for my little black letterboxing <br/>
log if I'd been so inclined, but fortunately that's not something that most <br/>
letterboxers have to deal with).<br/>
