                    <div id="ygrps-yiv-1295247934">I checked on the condition of both "Liberty" and "Capt.Moore's <br/>
Insignia" this morning (9/26). The "Insignia" was totally soaked from <br/>
the flood along the creek while "Victory's" box was covered with mud. <br/>
Both will be cleaned up, new books added and new ziplock bags used.<br/>
The area is a mess with large trees along the Delaware down and mud <br/>
everywhere! I expect to have them back in place no later than mid Oct.<br/>
Look for the posting.<br/>
