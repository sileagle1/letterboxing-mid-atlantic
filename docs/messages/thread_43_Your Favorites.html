                    <div id="ygrps-yiv-982958875">Hey folks,<br/>
<br/>
I'm just curious, what are some of your favorite boxes?  The ones you <br/>
planted and the ones you found.   <br/>
<br/>
My favorite planted box is my first, Campgaw.  <br/>
My favorite spot that I planted a box is the "In Memory" box.<br/>
My favorite stamp that I did is the Whale's Head Rock.<br/>
My favorite stamp that I found was "Dingman's Falls".  I think that <br/>
it's gone missing since.<br/>
My favorite tough box is Weiss Ecology Center, the first box that I <br/>
ever found.  I think there were only about 8 boxes in New Jersey at <br/>
the time.  It took me close to 6 hours to find it.<br/>
<br/>
I wouldn't of posted this to the main list, as I wanted to know about <br/>
boxes is this area.<br/>

But so far our favorite plants are our Grateful Dead boxes in DE. We love the stamps and love the park that their in. Can't wait ti read everyone else's relies though, especially Silent Doug! How can you possibly pick a favorite out of 300 finds!?<br/><br/><b><i>noreester &lt;SJinNJ@...&gt;</i></b> wrote:

My favorite planted box: The Place  <br/>
My favorite spot that I planted a box: Pasadena<br/>
My favorite stamp that I did: NJ Physiograpy<br/>
My favorite stamp that I found: Maritime Mystery #2<br/>
My favorite tough box: Intangible<br/>
More favorites...<br/>
My favorite place I found a box: Stone Living Room<br/>
Worst adventure planting a box: the MOSQUITOES at Island Beach!!! <br/>
Worse than Jake's Landing; they're five times bigger and land mouth <br/>
first and stick there.<br/>
Funniest adventure finding a box: Finding Splashing in the Devil's <br/>
Bathtub after a month of rain turned the clue's trail into part of a <br/>
nearby river. We had to throw down logs to get across the water to <br/>
the right hummock and then throw the box back across the water.<br/>
