Have you been privy to many, or any, extra box clues in your <br/>
travels? How did you come about them? Did you pass them on?<br/>
<br/>
I've only had one WoM relayed to me, last time I was in RI, and it <br/>
was a nice series. <br/>
<br/>
I remember seeing people holding cuckoo clues at the Washington's <br/>
Crossing gathering but had no idea how they came across them.<br/>

dues yet  :)<br/>
<br/>
But I have encountered bonus boxes. (Since I don't know if it's ok to <br/>
divulge that a box has bonus boxes associated with it, I won't <br/>
mention the box's name). It was a box with a very nice hike, and we <br/>
found two separate bonus box clues written in the logbook - we <br/>
searched and searched, but never found either bonus box. It was hard <br/>
to tell if it was because the original letterbox wasn't found in the <br/>
exact location the clues had led to or if they just weren't there.<br/>
<br/>
I keep thinking about planting a bonus box, though. There is another <br/>
box we visited which had FANTASTIC clues that really made you feel <br/>
like you were part of the story - the hike was absolutely beautiful - <br/>
and with every step our anticipation to get to the box just grew and <br/>
grew, because we couldn't wait to see the box and stamp. As we <br/>
unearthed the box, we agreed that this had been the best letterbox <br/>
ever, so far! With the wonderful integration of the clues to the <br/>
location and story, we felt sure the stamp would really be the icing <br/>
on the cake. When we opened the box, we found a store-bought stamp <br/>
(which would have been totally fine, if it had something to do with <br/>
the theme) that was so incomprehensively NOT related (not one iota) <br/>
to the theme. We were completely dumbfounded trying to figure out <br/>
what the planter had been thinking. So anyway, I keep thinking that I <br/>
need to plant a bonus box there, just to provide a stamp that will go <br/>
with the theme! That letterbox is still one of my favorites so far, <br/>
but that stamp is just some sort of weird Twilight Zone-ish twist in <br/>
the heart! Like the planter had dipped their hand blindfolded into a <br/>
vat of stamps and just grabbed one! Or maybe let their dog pick it <br/>
out! And, please, don't get me wrong - this would be one of the top <br/>
letterboxes I would recommend for someone to find, in spite of the <br/>
stamp.<br/>
<br/>
I wonder what reasons one generally has for planting a bonus box? I <br/>
would guess a great location would be reason number one - but has <br/>
anyone ever planted one in order to redeem the stamp in the original <br/>
box? Gee, I really hope this isn't making me sound terrible to you <br/>
all - I love ALL letterboxes and stamps! Really, I do!!<br/>

<div> </div>
<div>Personally I would like it.  My Christmas Tree Graveyards was my first, and crudest, stamp.  Someone else planted a box nearby that said, "follow the clues to Christmas Tree Graveyards and then do this..."  It was great.  She added a beautiful hand carved stamp and a hand made log that made my "series" more worth visiting.  </div>
<div> </div>
<div>You can always ask them:  "Hey I loved your series, the hike and your clues.  I would really like to carve a stamp to add another box to the series.    What do you think?"  Or some such.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>On the other hand should you find someplace else that's great and start something new?  </div>

Very good Sir Robin, LOL! But it's "air speed<br/>

Very good Sir Robin, LOL! But it's "air speed<br/>
velocity" not average velocity. But that's still<br/>
pretty darn good for this time of morning!<br/>

&gt; &gt; you are) and once I get the correct answers for<br/>

&gt; &gt; character, I email you the clues.<br/>
&gt; &gt; I'll probably only do that for a little while<br/>
&gt; until I<br/>
&gt; &gt; finally post the clues to the webpage, but I<br/>
&gt; wanted to<br/>

&gt; "Gorge of Eternal Peril" scene. The Old Man from scene<br/>
&gt; 24 is the keeper of the Bridge of Death. He asks the<br/>
&gt; Knights three questions "Who would cross the Bridge of<br/>
&gt; Death must answer me these questions three, 'ere the<br/>

&gt; are 4 variables depending on which character I decide<br/>
&gt; you are) and once I get the correct answers for that<br/>
&gt; character, I email you the clues.<br/>
&gt; I'll probably only do that for a little while until I<br/>
&gt; finally post the clues to the webpage, but I wanted to<br/>
&gt; give true Python fans first crack. We're hoping to<br/>
&gt; plant then the end of November. <br/>

&gt; &gt; I have been working on a few bonus boxes of late. I<br/>
&gt; &gt; have had <br/>
&gt; &gt; wonderful responses from the folks on whose works I<br/>
&gt; &gt; have built <br/>
&gt; &gt; upon.  <br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; I would never do anything without asking permission<br/>
&gt; &gt; first and so <br/>
&gt; &gt; far everyone has been enthusiatic.  When I brought<br/>
&gt; &gt; up some <br/>
&gt; &gt; questions about bonus boxes on the main list,<br/>
&gt; &gt; someone <br/>
&gt; &gt; brought up the concept of  "poaching."  I know there<br/>
&gt; &gt; is a great <br/>
&gt; &gt; temptation to drop a box when someone else has led<br/>
&gt; &gt; you into a <br/>
&gt; &gt; great location.  What are the thoughts on poaching?<br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; While I would never wish to limit the wonderful<br/>
&gt; &gt; variety that is <br/>
&gt; &gt; American Letterboxing, I am suspicious of WoMs.  It<br/>
&gt; &gt; seems a <br/>
&gt; &gt; little clique-ish to me.  I do love the constant<br/>
&gt; &gt; development of new <br/>
&gt; &gt; aspects of this game.<br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; Keep going<br/>

&gt; &gt; &gt; Just throwing a topic out for discussion...<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; Have you been privy to many, or any, extra box<br/>
&gt; &gt; clues in your <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; travels? How did you come about them? Did you pass<br/>
&gt; &gt; them <br/>
&gt; &gt; on?<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; I've only had one WoM relayed to me, last time I<br/>
&gt; &gt; was in RI, and <br/>
&gt; &gt; it <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; was a nice series. <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; I remember seeing people holding cuckoo clues at<br/>
&gt; &gt; the <br/>
&gt; &gt; Washington's <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; Crossing gathering but had no idea how they came<br/>
&gt; &gt; across <br/>
&gt; &gt; them.<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; Discuss amongst yourselves :)<br/>

Let me clarify that.  I don't plant boxes with WoM clues - but if you <br/>
got 'em, I'll take 'em.  [BIG SMIRK]<br/>

Well here I am in beautiful New Hampshire, found 3<br/>
very nice boxes. Two in Concord and one in Hopkinton.<br/>
One of the Concord boxes was an urban box, my first,<br/>
and was in a really cool place. Having a great time<br/>
wish you were all here and remember. Your Mother was a<br/>
hamster and your father smelled of elderberries!<br/>
