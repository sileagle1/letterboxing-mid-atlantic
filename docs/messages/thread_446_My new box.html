                    <div id="ygrps-yiv-666240285">Yeah, right! The only box that I've put out. I was trying to sound a <br/>
little misleading up front there. It took a long time to get that <br/>
show on the road. I'll go over to the new boxers board and weep, wail <br/>
and moan about my multiple shopping trips for carving tools and <br/>
materials. <br/>
<br/>
Being extremely forgetful didn't help either. I'd go to the craft <br/>
store for something, (and this place is not close) and not realize <br/>
till I'd gotten home that I forgot the gosh darn flippity wink (thats <br/>
not what I said) ink pad. Or, go to the supermarket and forget the <br/>
freezer bags. <br/>
<br/>
All in all, I'm really lucky to have gotten this box assembled, <br/>
planted and the clues up in 2004.  Some observent individual might <br/>
even notice that the box was planted on Friday the 24th and the clues <br/>
weren't available till today! Geeez.<br/>
<br/>
I did a terrible thing. I made my first box (and who would do this?) <br/>
a mystery box. Remember the thrill of finding your first box, your <br/>
first HH, being first finder??? ...of putting your first box out into <br/>
the big, wet world? I've set myself up for a wait. No one is going <br/>
out at lunch tomorrow for my box. I know people like MapSurfer do <br/>
that. I'm not suggesting that my box is *that* good; he plants boxes <br/>
that no one might ever find. Actually, Letterboxingbee does that. I <br/>
stamped in at one of the boxes Bev put out months ago and found that <br/>
I was only the 4th person to visit. I guess that means that I'll have <br/>
to put out another box soon. Yeah, right!<br/>
<br/>
It's called "Bought the Farm".</div>

Thanks for the box report too. I have no idea why it never occured   <br/>
to me that it could be washed out in the flooding. I'm so glad to <br/>
hear that it lived.<br/>
