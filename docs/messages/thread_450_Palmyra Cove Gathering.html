</span></blockquote>I geocache and I like it alot.  I have more cache finds than boxes <br/>
finds just because its so much more popular. Combined I have over 100 <br/>
finds in 6 months. Geocaches can be put into some pretty rough <br/>
terrained places also because the planter doesn't have to come up <br/>
with a set of clues, and since you have a little machine telling you <br/>
where to go...<br/>
<br/>
I've climbed mountains and walked through swamps to find a cache.  <br/>
The "trade stuff" is usually junk, but the hitchhikers are fun.  I've <br/>
been thinking about making some of my boxes hybrids.<br/>

But I have to say I was at a park today and looking for a place to <br/>

site tonight to see where else they were located-- library, the <br/>
local museum (2), k-mart-- I mean come on  :)<br/>
<br/>
We started doing this to get outside and get my 2 year olds <br/>
endurance up-- so we are picking the easier ones but most of the <br/>
geocache ones for our area seemed to be in drive by locations, not <br/>
enjoying the outdoors.<br/>

letterboxing for me, and it's been a bit of a his/hers thing for us, <br/>
although I'm more active in LB. We found that just about any neat <br/>
place with a letterbox in NJ was bound to have at least one <br/>
geocache, too. But there are geocaches, and then... there are <br/>
geocaches. Some are just "I dare you to find this spot" with no <br/>
consideration of the value of the place in and of itself. Blech.<br/>
The web-based-ness of cache-ing has spun off one thing that we think <br/>
is super-neat: the "locationless" geocache, where the "placer" does <br/>
nothing more than post the parameters for the places, and then <br/>
the "finders" post photos and write-ups of the places that fit the <br/>
bill. Wayne did one asking for original markers on the Mason-Dixon <br/>
line, and the responses could be made into a book! Great photos and <br/>
stories that give the history of each site. And we don't even have <br/>
to leave home!<br/>
And now, a tip from experience: if you are hunting both a geocache <br/>
and a letterbox in the same park as part of one excursion, do the <br/>
geocache first. "Why?" you say, "The gps will lead right from the <br/>
box to the cache, right?" Yeah, but in a direct line, not on the <br/>
route taken by the geocache placer from HIS starting point. So after <br/>
an hour of crawling through the trackless underbrush you may break <br/>
into the clearing and then shake your head reading the other log <br/>
entries about how easy the walk was.<br/>
