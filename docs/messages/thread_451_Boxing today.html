Glad to report that the box is high and dry, as it too is near water. <br/>
I'm really glad that it stopped raining before we got to the box. We <br/>
got all damp and got our shoes wet so we were forced to go to <br/>
Haddonfield and have fancy coffee drinks and fatty pastry.<br/>

<br/>
Yes, that is the proper medical treatment for this<br/>
type of emergency. Or my favorite "forced to have a<br/>
couple of six packs with a couple of hunky guys with<br/>
six pack abs". <br/>
<br/>
That works wonders too.<br/>
