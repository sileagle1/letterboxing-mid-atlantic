The Green Rose Labyrinth box is closed until further notice. I have <br/>
had to bar the labyrinth trail itself from public access due to some <br/>
large dangerous trees that have broken off and are hanging in the <br/>
canopy. I will remove them as soon as possible. <br/>
The Brass Dragon at the MD Ren Faire was washed away by the recent <br/>
rains. I was notified by a boxer that they found it laying by a post <br/>
on a Sunday next to wear it was velcro'ed, apparent having fallen <br/>
from the velcro. As they did not know wear the exact hiding point <br/>
was, they tucked it back next to the post, however the rains came <br/>
before I was able to visit. Sorry Scarab, I really wanted to maintain <br/>
them for ya. I hunted the slope over the rail but no sign. If ya <br/>
would like to re-place it before faire ends ya could mail me a backup <br/>
and I would hide it for ya. <br/>
Hope I see some more folks at the faire when ya come to enjoy the <br/>
park and visit our little "Face in the Trees". <br/>
