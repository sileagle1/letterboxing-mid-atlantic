<br/>
More than a hundred monsters spewed forth from the hellmouth that <br/>
opened it's maw under Mansfield last weekend.  A classic, small, <br/>
quaint, New England area of hills and forests and fine old dwellings <br/>
reduced to fear.  Answering the call, hunters from all over, <br/>
descended upon the normally sleepy town and outnumbered the fiends <br/>
four or five to one.  Night Owl and I were fortunate to accompany a <br/>
team from the south, of MD/VA hunters.  We were led by a <br/>
relentless 'Van Helsing like' hunter of wide renown:  Dead Duck <br/>
Chuck.  <br/>
<br/>
Arriving at dusk on Friday our team forebore any respite from the <br/>
long journey, swallowed their fear, and plunged into the forest.  <br/>
Even the young pixie sprite, Claire de Lune, braved the shadows and <br/>
oncoming dark.  <br/>
<br/>
Such monsters to behold!  Frankenstein by Team Green Dragon, wrapped <br/>
in black velvet and tied in red ribbon.  Werewolves, phantoms, <br/>
vampires.  Strange noises in the dark.  Hoo Hoo,hoo Woo.  "Stop <br/>
that!  You're scaring me."  "I didn't to it."  Twice we were lost in <br/>
the dark in the unfamiliar woods, despairing of our quest.  Finally, <br/>
just before the hour of nine, we found our last quarry near the <br/>
mysterious obelisk by the headless cemetery.  <br/>
<br/>
"Get what rest you can," advises our Van Helsing, Dead Duck <br/>
Chuck, "we hunt again at dawn."  Night Owl burned candle into the <br/>
wee hours mapping out strategy, literally upon a locally obtained <br/>
atlas.  I carved a last minute impression to share with fellow <br/>
hunters at the gather.  <br/>
<br/>
From dawn until into the night, the next day we hunted.  <br/>
<br/>
In the afternoon we paused to exchange hunting art with others of <br/>
our kind, a mad frenzy of four or five hundred fellow hunters.  <br/>
(Strangely we met only few of them on the trails.)  In the <br/>
disorienting crowd I made only some fifty new exchanges, but that <br/>
without even much trying.  Tempus Fugit had the right idea to bring <br/>
camp chairs, park in a quieter corner, and let people come to us.  <br/>
The line to stamp in stretched long for a couple hours.  Food, <br/>
music, bingo, trivia contests, raffles -- the hunters knew how to <br/>
gather.  More than once I searched through the crowd for an <br/>
impression I had seen in someone else's journal.   In the course of <br/>
the afternoon, the other relentless hunters talked me out of my more <br/>
obscure travellers.  <br/>
<br/>
Off again, we hunted and hunted on into the night.  Van Helsing/Dead <br/>
Duck Chuck often plunged ahead to the next hunt while we cleaned up <br/>
the last.  Faithful companion, Tuxie, often had to lead us to him.  <br/>
So determined were we, so driving our Van Helsing, that we left <br/>
Wanda and Pete in our wake as we rushed onwards.  "Great to see you, <br/>
gotta run."  We barely noticed the gorgeous forest scene: towering <br/>
trees, babbling brooks, little waterfalls, little wood bridges, <br/>
leaves beginning to change, colorful fungus, a river of rocks to <br/>
climb, boulders and stone walls, stone walls, stone walls.  <br/>
<br/>
We hunted Universal monsters, TV monsters, Munsters, classical <br/>
monsters, screaming monsters, monsters with bad teeth, with one eye, <br/>
too many legs, cartoons, cookie monsters, science fiction wonders, <br/>
and "The Attack of the 50 Foot Woman".  <br/>
<br/>
Late that night we found ourselves in a quaint old country store, <br/>
with a quaint proprietess, contemplating a treasure chest containing <br/>
a fabulously wrought Gollum.  <br/>
<br/>
In the end, after two nights, a day, and a morning, we had hunted <br/>
down some sixty of the fiends.  We left a lot of impressions.  <br/>
