for boxes 4 miles from destination, and no boxing. Just a nice hike <br/>
in what we thought was a well-known park with the college freshman <br/>
daughter who showed it to us anew from the prospective of her <br/>
geology field trip last week. And yes, it already has a box, which <br/>
we nabbed in September. Balance of time spent at homecoming (my <br/>
25th!) and gabbing late into the night with old friends. Nice trip, <br/>
but way too short.<br/>

beat the rain on Saturday by searching for B &amp; E's boxes in the <br/>
Armentrout Preserve. We found all three, plus a couple of surprizes. <br/>
We loved the pic of B &amp; E - and thoroughly enjoyed their fun <br/>
personalities - hopefully we'll meet them in person on the trail <br/>
someday! Charbon was most entertaining!<br/>
<br/>
While there, we found the poor lost Mikayla HH chasing a hummin' <br/>
bird. Mikayla is now travelling with us, sniffing out the next spot <br/>
to rest, and hoping to find her way back home (someday.) Seems <br/>
appropriate that she spent time with B &amp; E!<br/>
<br/>
While stamping in, we noticed an 8 year-old by the trail name "Mini" <br/>
had stamped into the boxes as well. "Mini" stamps in using a penguin <br/>
stamp. We found the stamp laying on the trail near the last box (W. <br/>
W.'s Halloween Fly By). We'd love to get this personal stamp back <br/>
to "Mini" - if anyone knows how we might reach "Mini", we'll mail it <br/>
back to him/her. Send me a private email if you know "Mini". Thanks!<br/>

                    <div id="ygrps-yiv-1017181510">I went on a box check.<br/>
<br/>
A Garden Box  - Tropical Storm Gaston visited and put the Garden box <br/>
under three feet of water.  The letterbox set sail but was blocked <br/>
from going down stream by the fallen tree that it was under.  It was <br/>
dry and put back in place. <br/>
<br/>
Rebellion - Gaston also visited the Rebellion Box.  The brook it was <br/>
beside rose from three feet deep to 15 feet deep in one afternoon.  <br/>
So the box ended up under about five feet of water.  It was under a <br/>
rock so it stayed put.    I did have to dig it out from teh sand and <br/>
mud that was left behind.  Gaston left it's wet stamp. The park this <br/>
box is at was destroyed so the box has been removed and will be <br/>
replaced when they fix the park.<br/>
<br/>
Belle Isle - Soaking wet, so box is removed for cleaning.  Not sure <br/>
if it was Jeane or Gaston who signed in at this letterbox.<br/>
<br/>
Huguenot Flatwater - Jeane sent floodwaters down the James so this <br/>
box was under water for a short time.  Jeane left her wet stamp so it <br/>
has also been removed so it can dry out. <br/>
<br/>
Robiious Landing - High and Dry. Although part of the path was under <br/>
water.<br/>
<br/>
While I did take possible flooding into account, I did not take a one <br/>
in 2400 year flood (TS Gaston) into account or a river being smart <br/>
enough to find my letterbox.<br/>

B &amp; E (and their parents) went up to Green Lane to look for "Little <br/>
Lady Bug."  We had a great hike, E tried out his new role as "pack <br/>
dog" and did very well (except for the time he walked into the water).<br/>
Alas!  We didn't find "Little Lady Bug."  In fact, we didn't see the <br/>
sign that was a big clue at the end, either.  Is it possible it's no <br/>
longer there?  <br/>
We would have searched for the "Leap Day Series" at the Green Lane <br/>
Nature Preserve, too, but B &amp; E were prohibited!  They were quite <br/>
distressed. Now we will have to sneak back without them.<br/>
To assuage their disappointment, we then went down to Green Lane Park <br/>
and found the Raindears' "Intro to Boxing" series.<br/>
