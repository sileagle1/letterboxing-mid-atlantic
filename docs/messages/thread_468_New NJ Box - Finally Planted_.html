would be planting there. Saddler's was one of the places that I was <br/>
eyeing. It was one of the reasons that I placed my letterbox <br/>
elsewhere. There are too many 'barren' parks in SNJ to put 2 boxes in <br/>
one place.<br/>

very recent discussion of Saddler's Woods there. It's one of only two <br/>
old growth forests in SJ - if I'm remembering correctly - another was <br/>
a small patch in the pine barrens. I live about 2 blocks away - it's <br/>
been an interesting transition, as these woods sat neglected and <br/>
unprotected for many years until development threatened and their age <br/>
and significance was discovered. The conservation group is trying to <br/>
transition use of the area from local dirt bike riders to nature <br/>
walkers and education. They've done a good job so far, but cleanup <br/>
efforts remain very important. It sure is an amazing place to walk <br/>
through - some of the big trees are really quite amazing! They have a <br/>
really nice website at saddlerswoods.com (I especially enjoy the <br/>
Creative Corner with photos, art and poetry about the woods.)<br/>

<br/>
You're right - but then again, I look at all the great series in <br/>
Bucks County and think if we started doing that here, we could really <br/>
draw boxers to the area! We've got some great parks here that could <br/>
support a series. Caite has been planning a fractal series (she's a <br/>
math freak/geek) for Newton Lake Park - of course, field hockey has <br/>
put a serious damper on that effort for right now - even though she <br/>
runs around the lake nearly every day! <br/>
<br/>
But you are right - we need to fill all those SJ barren parks! Let's <br/>
make it a new Bucks Co. (which I regard as a mini-CT!)<br/>
