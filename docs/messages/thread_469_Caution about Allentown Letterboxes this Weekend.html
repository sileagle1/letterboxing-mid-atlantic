<br/>
not much good at haikus, so I've been quiet lately.<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, if you are thinking of coming to Allentown to hunt General <br/>
Trexler's letterbox, Pass-Set-Spike or Allentown Rose Garden, be <br/>
aware that there are serious festivitiews going on in these parks <br/>
this weekend.  It is the General Trexler Sesquicentennial <br/>
celebration.  Sunday will be the more crowded day.  Little Lehigh <br/>
park will be busy as well, for those of you looking into the Perfect <br/>
Circle Letterboxing Guild's "Fish in Outer Space" series or Robin <br/>
Hood's Hat.  Lenape is far enough west to be away from the mayhem.<br/>
<br/>
If you are coming to Allentown, I would encourage boxing on Saturday, <br/>
as Sunday will be "Harry's Day in the Parks"...<br/>
