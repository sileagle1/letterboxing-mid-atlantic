<br/>
Convinced my brother I needed to go to Cape Henlopen Park (Lewes DE) <br/>
Fri evening before we went to dinner and before the $5/car fee starts <br/>
in May.  After I went trudging thru the sand trying to find "Cape <br/>
Henlopen" box my size 8 shoes began to feel like size 5!  Actually, <br/>
I'm not sure we were even in the correct parking lot because we were <br/>
facing the Atlantic Ocean not DE Bay.  My brother thinks I'm crazy.<br/>
<br/>
So we moved on to "Cape Henlopen Tower" but the box journal was <br/>
filled - I will notify planter.  And I had forgotten my stamp pad <br/>
because I was using hand drawn labels until my personal stamp <br/>
arrives.  So I will have to go back and pay my $5 to get my journal <br/>
stamped--or wait til next Apr. At least my brother knows I wasn't <br/>
making it all up, but still thinks I'm crazy.<br/>
