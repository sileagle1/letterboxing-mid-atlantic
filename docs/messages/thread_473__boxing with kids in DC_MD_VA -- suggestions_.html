<br/>
This fall my kids and I have had some time to get in more <br/>
letterboxing.  We've found many new Montgomery County MD boxes to <br/>
add to our logbook and are ready to go further afield and enjoy this <br/>
gorgeous autumn weather.<br/>
<br/>
We're looking for suggestions for boxes in the DC-metro area -- what <br/>
are some of your favorites -- ones that have gotten you into new <br/>
locales or among pretty scenery?  (I know, they're all our <br/>
favorites...)<br/>
<br/>
My kids are pretty hardy walkers, but I'd appreciate a "head's up" <br/>
if the walk is more than 1/2 - 3/4 mile or if the clues are <br/>
particularly challenging.  If you all say it's worth it and a <br/>
favorite box, we'll give it a try, but we'll plan accordingly!<br/>
<br/>
We also planted a box last week -- we love the White's Ferry area <br/>
and put one out there -- hope you'll look it up!<br/>

We went out for finds 6, 7 &amp; 8 today and you beat us to all 3!  So I'm <br/>
not much help there.  My son liked baby viking's fingerprint!  Have you <br/>
been to Damascus Dragon?  We were there a couple of weeks ago and I <br/>
can't remember if I saw you in the logbook.  If not, it has fun clues <br/>
but it is about a half hour walk one way and the last leg is up a very <br/>
steep hill.  I liked Tempus Fugit's remark.  It's a butt buster!<br/>
<br/>
As for our 3 finds today, 2 of them had hitchhikers.  What a surprise!  <br/>
We didn't expect to even find one this early in our boxing endeavors!<br/>
<br/>
Also, for anyone in the Montgomery Co. area, I have added a new logbook <br/>
to Black Hill Shore Box and replaced the broken box and soggy logbook at <br/>
Blair Letterboxing Project.   Then as soon as I got home, I looked at <br/>
the LBNA website and found out that several more boxes had been placed <br/>
in that same park!  They weren't listed a few days before that.  Now we <br/>
have to go back again!  We've been hampered with vehicle problems.  <br/>
Hopefully, everything has been fixed and we will be after all the boxes <br/>
around here!<br/>

<br/>
Black Hill Shore Box<br/>
Blair Letterboxing Project<br/>
The Windmills of Backbone Mountain<br/>
Centennial Park/ Windmills<br/>
Damascus Dragon<br/>
The Magic Mushroom  (found Mad Dawg #1 HH)<br/>
The Sun  (found The Travelin' Terp HH), Moon &amp; Stars  (2 boxes)<br/>
<br/>
They're all in Maryland except the two windmill boxes, they're in WV.  <br/>
One of them was planted by Irene.  The other one was planted nearby in <br/>
the same dinky little park on the same day by someone else.  I would <br/>
tell you how "nearby" but I don't want to give anything away.  I really <br/>
think there is some letterboxing spirit at work here.<br/>
<br/>
We're hoping to go looking for some of your boxes soon!  We're trying to <br/>
decide where to place the hitchhikers.  And my son thinks we should make <br/>
one of our own also.  Since I'm from WV, we might have to make a <br/>
Mountaineer HH so Travelin' Terp will have some friendly competition!<br/>

in Silver Spring: We just did Bloom Where You're Planted (by Moss<br/>
Piglet) - cute little park with an activity for kids (or kids at heart)<br/>
in Beltsville (shameless self promotion) Baron's Dog Walk - only one<br/>
kind of steep hill - four nice stamps of dogs - all still in place a<br/>
month ago <br/>
<br/>

<br/>
</span></blockquote>A little longer (RT 2miles)- College Park - Tornado Alley - all boxes<br/>
repaired and replaced a month ago - Parks people have put together a<br/>
nice set of info boards on what happens after a tornado<br/>

<div>Lake Frank and Lake Needwood in Montogmety County have a couple of good boxes for kids.  Lake Frank Turtle would make a nice autumn hike, mostly on a trail.  We've tried to find the other Lake Frank box (Fungus) a couple of times with no luck. But also a nice walk...down a steepish semi-trail.  </div>
<div> </div>
<div>There's a fun indoor one in the Olney Library.  And another personal favorite in Olney as well. </div>
<div> </div>
<div>We're going to try a couple in Howard County today at Schooley Mill Park. They look fun and the setting looks good for kids.</div>

<div>See ya out there!</div>
