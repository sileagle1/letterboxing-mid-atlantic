Chesapeake Family Magazine, a free monthly for parents and such, <br/>
available at local grocery stores and other locations, just published <br/>
a story on boxing as a cover byline. The writer contacted me from the <br/>
board, just about the time some of the questions about articles and <br/>
their impact on the hobby were coming out. I discussed many of these <br/>
concerns with her and that printing any direct clues or comments on <br/>
actually boxes was not such a good idea. She took these to heart and <br/>
there is even a disclaimer in the article about asking permission. <br/>
She used a wonderful pic of my son finding a box, and allthough I had <br/>
orginally identified the location to her, I asked her not to print it <br/>
and she agreed. Nice little article, just the kind to encourage the <br/>
hobby but not overload it. We ourselves, found letterboxing thru an <br/>
article, and I think they are a good idea within certain parameters. <br/>
So anyone who wants to know what Team Woodwose looks like, well check <br/>
out the Oct. Issue, free in a store near you. <br/>
