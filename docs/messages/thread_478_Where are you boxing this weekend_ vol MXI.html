                    <div id="ygrps-yiv-829828080">I tried to do some maintenance today on my Washington<br/>
Corssing boxes, Cheshire Cat and Abstract Guitar. I<br/>
knew the area had gotten hit hard per Ed's previous<br/>
post but man, did it get hit hard. The access road<br/>
behind the Thompson Neely House is closed. I parked<br/>
elsewhere and Dude and I hiked in. Abstract Guitar is<br/>
totally gone. Oh well, Carmen's first stamp and he<br/>
didn't like it anyway. Cheshire Cat was completely<br/>
ruin and the stamp seperated from the base. We'll<br/>
eventually replant but not until spring.<br/>
<br/>
Then I chased the ever elusive Miss Jane Austen.<br/>
Persuasion, I think it was up the road a piece. Found<br/>
the cemetery, found the rocks, did not find the box.<br/>
But Dude and I had a great time climbing all over the<br/>
rocks and stream and checking out the gravestones. A<br/>
really neat little place that we had all to ourselves.<br/>
Emma we DID find and enjoyed that park very much too!<br/>
<br/>
Tomorrow I am meeting up with Celtic Cat, Wednesday<br/>
Bowler and Jan (can't remember her trail name) and her<br/>
dog Barney to hunt some boxes in Ambler. <br/>
<br/>
My PLB Truckin is home for a visit so I will be<br/>
bringing that to the gathering and Carmen is just<br/>
busting he is so damn happy with his lastest stamp<br/>
that we are making a PLB. I raised my boys on all of<br/>
the classics, Marvel Comics, Monty Python, Mad<br/>
Magazine. Carmen has created a "Mad Fold-In" image<br/>
that is really cool. It's two images, one laid out<br/>
flat, and another when you fold it in. Plus the<br/>
wording chages as well. We're brining it to the<br/>
gathering and then mailing it out. <br/>
<br/>
Been kind of quiet lately, yet another death in the<br/>
family, my sisters husband. This has not been the<br/>
greatest year for my family. We're looking forward to<br/>
2005. Well, take care and see you all next Saturday.<br/>
Good Lord willin' and the creek don't rise, as my Ma<br/>
always said.<br/>
