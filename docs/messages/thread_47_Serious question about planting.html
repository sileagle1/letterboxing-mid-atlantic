As a letterboxer living in Philadelphia, there aren't many places I <br/>
can hide boxes. I have several stamps carved and ready to be planted, <br/>
and I've been thinking for a long time about hiding them in Fairmount <br/>
Park - Philly's largest park at 9,100 acres.<br/>
<br/>
Now obviously not all of those acres are accessible to people or <br/>
letterboxers for that matter. And I wanted to hide my boxes in <br/>
relatively populated areas. The issue is that there have been...not <br/>
exactly a "string", per se, but several serious crimes committed in <br/>
various parts of the Park in the past year. What's bringing this <br/>
topic to the LBMA group is that I read in the news that another body <br/>
was found in an underpopulated area of the Park over the weekend  :-\ <br/>
which makes me question my hiding spots...<br/>
<br/>
My primary concern would be, of course, people's safety, which is why <br/>
I'd hide my boxes in well-populated areas and not let people go off <br/>
the beaten path. I could wait to plant my boxes until this "dies <br/>
down", but crimes are, unfortunately, a way of life - especially in a <br/>
large city. <br/>
<br/>
I guess my question to all of you folks is - should I just skip <br/>
hiding in the Park altogether? Should I just find areas in the 'burbs <br/>
and countryside to hide my boxes? Or should I go ahead with my plan <br/>
to hide them in well-populated areas and ask people to remember <br/>
they're in an urban environment - and hope that people who are not <br/>
comfortable being in a city won't go..?<br/>
<br/>
Any thoughts would be greatly appreciated...<br/>
<br/>

Ask yourself this question... Is this park a special place that is <br/>
worth drawing people to? My guess is, yes. So, I say go ahead and <br/>
plant them. Keep them in the more used areas of the park. Remind <br/>
people that this is an urban park that has different dangers than <br/>
your middle-of-nowhere park. Maybe suggest that these boxes do not be <br/>
sought alone. Or state it in the positive: Use the buddy system! :)<br/>
I hope you are careful when planting them.  Let us know what you end <br/>
up doing. <br/>
(random other thoughts)<br/>
I grew up in the DC area. I know what I need to do to take care of <br/>
myself in the city. I also grew up in scouting, another safety <br/>
focused group. So I tend to be more cautious than the next average <br/>
joe/jane. But there are lots of boxes in Rock Creek Park down here. <br/>
This park always sticks in my head as a bit 'sketchy' b/c of all the <br/>
missing people reported to be seen there last. But at the same time <br/>
is a beautiful park, where lots of folks go to enjoy green space! We <br/>
all take risks when we venture out. And just a little reminder of <br/>
that with your clues, may be enough to weed out those that are not <br/>
city-savvy.<br/>
<br/>
good luck! <br/>

could just put ONE LB there, in a populated area.  Or put a caution <br/>
in your clues, especially if folks should not venture in alone.  <br/>
Concentrating on following clues may make a seeker less aware of <br/>
their surroundings/safety.  Of course it is easier for you to <br/>
maintain a box that is easy to access - so where do you like to go <br/>
that others might find interesting or fun to visit? Not everyone is a <br/>
hiker (with or without hounds) - and near a museum is just as special.<br/>
In the end if you feel safe planting the box on your own, that should <br/>
be your first consideration.<br/>

<p><tt>In my opinion, you should go ahead and plant the boxes. Make sure to include in the clues that the area may not be a good spot to go to alone or at night. Accidents and crime can happen ANYWHERE! Just because a box is in the 'countryside' does not ensure that the area is safe. There are many boxes in urbane areas that may or may not be considered 'safe'. Everyone should use caution whenever and wherever they go, but don't miss out on life because of fear.</tt></p>

<div>You raise some valid concerns and I liked Judy and Sam's comments. It's a tough call. Judy mentioned near a museum. Behind the art museum near the old Water works there is an area that might work for a least one box, not sure though. Also, remember, no where is really 100% safe. We must all be smart no matter where we go or what we are doing. I agree with Sam that the buddy system is the way to go. Before I started letterboxing and was just hiking (with my hounds) I ALWAYS told my family where I was heading and when I expected to be home. And a couple of times I found myself way back on trails with just my 14 year old mutt and wondered if this was the right place to be for a 45 year old, out of shape, can't run, can barely walk woman and a 14 year old dog who probably has the same issues. And this was in suburban parks. Also, two of the parks I frequent, Silver Lake and Playwicki have both had bodies found in them in the last year, and they're both in Bucks County. So it's
 really an issue to be considered anywhere. Just my 2 cents.</div>

                    <div id="ygrps-yiv-1421790240">Besides the safety issue you also have to worry about the box <br/>
lasting in a busy park.  Most letterboxes go unnoticed for a long <br/>
time off the beaten trail in a woodsy park.  Planting boxes in an <br/>
urban park is very dicey.  If the gardeners don't get them the kids <br/>
playing will.  I've seen many boxes that don't last a summer in such <br/>
a place.  Also you want to avoid sensitive historical areas and such.<br/>
<br/>
You will have to look around carefully and ask yourself "Can this <br/>
hiding place be easily seen?  Easily discovered by chance?"  Think <br/>
like a gardener or a curious kid.  This only compounds your problem <br/>
of well hidden but dangerous.  <br/>
<br/>
I like microboxes in urban settings.  You can tie them with a long <br/>
velcro strap to the branch of an evergreen bush.  This keeps them <br/>
out of sight and off the ground from the gardeners.  Their small <br/>
size is also less threatening to the humorless security folks, at <br/>
least I hope it is.  There is a good picture of a microbox in the <br/>
main Yahoo list's photos.  <br/>
<br/>
What I recommend you do not do is to put out several new boxes at <br/>
once before you try out the area.  It would be a shame to plant a <br/>
series you are proud of only to have them disappear quickly.  There <br/>
is a great Lion series here in DC in an urban park.  Two of them <br/>
were poorly located and one is already missing.  I do not expect the <br/>
other to survive unless it is moved to a better location.<br/>
<br/>
With all that in mind it is yet possible to plant boxes in a busy <br/>
urban setting.  Feel free to write and ask more and I'll describe my <br/>
successful urban hides.  Experiment and have fun.<br/>
