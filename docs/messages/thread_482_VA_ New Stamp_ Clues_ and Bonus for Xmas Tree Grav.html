                    <div id="ygrps-yiv-1738070842">October 13, 2004:  I carved a new stamp, slightly changed the <br/>
location, and altered the clues.  That makes it a New Find.  Look <br/>
for the Bonus Clue during October, to lead you to the Halloween <br/>
Graveyard, and a couple more boxes.<br/>
<br/>
It's only 75 cents to drive out to Robert Simon's dream, Reston, a <br/>
planned community of work, home and play, in rolling Northern <br/>
Virginia among preserved woods. These directions will take you <br/>
through a creek valley of tall trees in one of the natural areas of <br/>
Reston, Virginia. <br/>
<br/>
From the Beltway, I-495, take the Dulles Toll Road, route 267, west <br/>
to Hunter Mill Road. Left on Hunter Mill and right on Sunrise Valley <br/>
Drive. Take the third left onto Cross School Road. First Right on <br/>
Midsummer Drive. On your left you will come to Dayflower Court. <br/>
There on the right is a small park. Park. <br/>
<br/>
Walk between the two benches down a steep path and across a gully. <br/>
You'll pass the first Christmas Tree Graveyard. Follow the path down <br/>
into the woods all the way down into woodpecker valley. Keep an ear <br/>
open for Woody Woodpecker's relatives. Yes the big ones with the red <br/>
feather crowns live here. Did you know you can tell which way is <br/>
north in a forest by observing which side the moss grows on trees? <br/>
Be careful there is poison ivy around here. You'll come to a T at <br/>
the path that runs the length of this small valley. Turn right. <br/>
<br/>
The path heads north along the narrow swath cleared of trees for the <br/>
water line. Look for tall dead trees with woodpecker holes. You'll <br/>
pass a tall manhole cover and a muddy spring. You're following a <br/>
creek way off to the side. Along the way, you will also see tall <br/>
tree, split in two and way up high. There are many parallel paths, <br/>
some made by bikers to avoid the mud and the spring.  You will have <br/>
to figure out the way on your own.  Just be sure to follow the <br/>
creek, along the right side, until you come to a bridge.  <br/>
<br/>
(You're not supposed to cross the creek any more due to erosion.  I <br/>
am sure you can figure out a way around.)<br/>
<br/>
At bridge 31 go north, continuing on a dirt path, still following <br/>
along the right side of the creek. Very soon you'll see a 9' tall, <br/>
rotting, tree stump. Walk around it in a U-turn and take a bearing <br/>
of 120 degrees.  Walk that that direction to the root end of a large <br/>
fallen tree and the Christmas Tree Graveyard. <br/>
<br/>
Be sure to bring clues for the "Furry Woodland Creature" letterbox <br/>
too, which is nearby, which, if you're clever, you can do along the <br/>
way.<br/>
<br/>
Afterwards you can either return the way you came or take the paved <br/>
trailed East from bridge 31 to the road and go to the right to your <br/>
car.</div>
