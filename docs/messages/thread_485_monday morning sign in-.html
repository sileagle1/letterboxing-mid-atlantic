We finally got Winfoot's Mountainside box, in the new location. The <br/>
old one had us unsuccessfully up and down the trails, counting <br/>
firepits, crossing streams, etc, etc, last year. Since then I've <br/>
been frowning at the mountain every time I went by on 287, which is <br/>
at least weekly, taking the kids to the gym further down on the same <br/>
mountain.<br/>
Success at last.<br/>
