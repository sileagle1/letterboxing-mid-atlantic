                    <div id="ygrps-yiv-1071566064">Hello (especially to Wordfried! 8-D),<br/>
<br/>
Just posted this on the Big List, but wanted to add the more <br/>
personalized version here...<br/>
<br/>
09 OCT 2004<br/>
"P-U Letterbox":  Well hidden and easy to get to--especially if you <br/>
don't mind heights...If you have to drive on I-81 past Edinburg, it's <br/>
worth the quick stop.  My 7-year-old accompanied me on this one, his <br/>
first.  The whole experience came home for him as he scampered up the <br/>
stairs to grab the box first.  Now he wants to do it, too.<br/>
<br/>
"Seven Bends":  Still there and in good shape.  My son wanted to see <br/>
this one, too.  And it was an excuse to climb the firetower on the <br/>
way.<br/>
<br/>
"Woodstock Tower Seedling":  I've looked for it twice now without <br/>
success.  All of the fallen leaves and my lack of imagination make <br/>
this one a tough one for me.  I can't tell if I was in the right area <br/>
or not.  I sent email to Wordfried, so we'll see.<br/>
<br/>
11 OCT 2004<br/>
"Where the Poison Ivy Leaf Grows":  A little trouble finding the <br/>
correct boxwood, and lots of sticker covered runners.  Box was dry <br/>
and in good shape.  Logbook slightly damp, but OK.<br/>
<br/>
"In the Park--Sports Series #3":  Wow, this one is well-bagged.  Nice <br/>
box, stamp and a good park.  Everything dry and in good shape.<br/>
<br/>
"Clark's Crossing":  Be careful getting this one.  Part of the trail <br/>
that run's by the creek looks like it's been seriously eroded during <br/>
last rash of big storms to come through.  One mis-step and it's a 3 <br/>
foot drop straight into 3+ feet of water...Parking lot for the park, <br/>
as of this evening, it completely torn up as new curbs and street are <br/>
going in.  Lot's of "Do Not Enter" signs...;-).  It's a quick scamper <br/>
though to the park behind the construction though.  The box is in <br/>
decent shape, dry, but logbook is a touch damp.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks,<br/>
