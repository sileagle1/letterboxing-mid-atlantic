funeral and wake. It was actually really great. My<br/>
brother-in-law Dan was the worlds biggest Deadhead. My<br/>
son Bob played Ripple at the graveside and we all sang<br/>
along. Pretty cool...<br/>

Anyway, Dude and I had a wonderful day yesterday<br/>
boxing with Celtic Cat and Wednesday Bowler, and<br/>
Janila and her 4 legged buddy Barney. After a not so<br/>
promising start, we found all 4 boxes there. We think<br/>
the picnic tables have been moved since the boxes were<br/>
placed and started out totally on the wrong side of<br/>
things, but we finally go on the right trails. A fun<br/>
day with some great folks. A personal note about<br/>
Wednesday Bowler, she had eye surgery today to correct<br/>
a detached retina caused by diabetes. She has been on<br/>
my mind all day and I hope all went well. Now she has<br/>
to stay face down for a month! I would go out of my<br/>
mind. So let's think good thoughts and I think<br/>
Marybeth, Celtic Cat, is going to try and make the<br/>
gathering on Saturday. I'll pick up a big get well<br/>
card for us all to sign that she can read when she<br/>
gets her eyesight back. See you guys on Saturday. I am<br/>
picking up Miss Moon from NYC at the train station so<br/>
that she can join in the fun too.<br/>

I figure I'll get there at the crack of dawn to allow<br/>
myself plenty of time to mis-read the clues, get lost,<br/>
pass out on trail, wake up and actually find a box or<br/>
two and report for duty at 6:30 PM. <br/>

&gt; Hey Nate,<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I called Beth and signed up to volunteer at Graehme<br/>
&gt; Park (I know I spelled that wrong!) on Saturday<br/>
&gt; night,<br/>
&gt; the 30th. Now gimme the clues!<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; ***************************************************<br/>
&gt; Can't wait, huh.  Glad you are volunteering.  I have<br/>
&gt; the boxes all made up <br/>
&gt; and ready to go, and will be planting them this<br/>
&gt; Sunday.  I will send you the <br/>
&gt; clues as soon as they are made up (by Monday).<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I was hoping to get them planted before now, I've<br/>
&gt; had the boxes ready for <br/>
&gt; weeks, I just have not really had the chance to<br/>
&gt; plant.<br/>
