<br/>
<br/>
I am so excited for Saturday.  I hope the weather will hold out for <br/>
us.  Keep your fingers crossed.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Just a few notes:<br/>
<br/>
About the carving class, I have received interest from about 12 <br/>
people so far.  This will be a small informal class that will take <br/>
place right after lunch (1pm) in the class room.  It won't last <br/>
longer than 1 hour so it won't conflict with your hunting <br/>
times.  :)    <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
For those that have already expressed interest and I have already <br/>
spoken with:<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Just a reminder to:<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
**  Please bring your own carving tools<br/>
**  I will supply the carving material to practice on for the class, <br/>
but feel free to bring your own <br/>
**  Please bring a black &amp; white picture that you want to carve, I <br/>
will have generic images to choose from if you wish<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
If you are interested in this class and have NOT spoken with me yet <br/>
please let me know so I know how much carving material to bring.  <br/>
Thank you.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
The lunchmeat tray has been ordered.  There should be plenty of food <br/>
there for people who still have not rsvp'd me or should decide at the <br/>
last minute to join us.  <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Thanks to Doug for the following instructions:<br/>
<br/>
"For all you letterboxers attending the gathering from PA, here are <br/>
some driving directions:  After passing through the toll booths on <br/>
the Tacony-Palmyra Bridge (there's no toll for NJ-bound vehicles), <br/>
head to the left lane. At the first light, turn left, and follow the <br/>
small brown signs for the Palmyra Cove Nature Center. You'll <br/>
eventually go back west past the toll booths and then under the <br/>
highway to reach the nature center."<br/>
<br/>
If your from the Jersey side:  take 73 North.  Just before the bridge <br/>
there is a Gas/Mini Store/Donut shop on your right.  RIGHT after the <br/>
store make a right.  Watch for the brown signs for Palmyra Cove.  Go <br/>
through one intersection and at the next intersection (the apartment<br/>
complex) make a left.  Your going to go past the "toll house" and you <br/>
will be driving right along side the toll booths.  You will be going <br/>
under the bridge and straight into the Palmyra Cove parking lot.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
This looks to be shaping up to be a mini "MMM".  Ha ha, just kidding, <br/>
right now the count is close to 40 people.  This should be a lot of <br/>
fun.  Can't wait to see you all again and meet all the newbies too.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Feel free to bring any HH's that you have or plan to release.  <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I'll keep the update page up til the day of the gathering is case <br/>
there are any more rsvp's or updates.  Otherwise see you all on <br/>
Saturday.<br/>
<br/>
