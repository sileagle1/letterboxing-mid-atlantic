<br/>
I am not sure how many parking spots Palmyra Cove's parking lot has,<br/>
but when you arrive if there happens to be no parking spots left<br/>
please come into the building (opens 10am) and ask the desk to have<br/>
the overflow parking lot, that is directly under the bridge, opened.  <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Then if the overflow lot happens to get filled there is extra parking<br/>
on Market Street and Temple Blvd but you will have to walk a short<br/>
distance back to the park.  It's very easy and you don't have to drive<br/>
back onto Route 73.  Go out the same road you come into the park on<br/>
and there will be parking on your right (Market Street) near the "toll<br/>
house".  OR continue "straight" through the intersection at the Korman<br/>
suites, park on Temple Blvd.  Do not enter or park in the apartment<br/>
complex.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Hope this helps.  <br/>
<br/>

I stayed up really late last night making up the "Parking Lot Blues"<br/>
box. You can pick it up at the toll booth. ;p Yeah, right. Don't get <br/>
run over! <br/>
