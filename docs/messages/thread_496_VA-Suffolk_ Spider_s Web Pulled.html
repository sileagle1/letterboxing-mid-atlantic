park, I pulled Spider's Web a few weeks ago. Bat Cave, the second box <br/>
in that series was missing. I have asked the letterboxing.org <br/>
webmasters to pull that clue. The owners have not answered two emails <br/>
on the subject. If these boxes were on your to do list, scratch them <br/>
off. I'll probably add the clues to the basement to preserve them.<br/>
<br/>
More details of the problems:<br/>
<br/>
ALL of the man-made objects in step #1 were removed by the park <br/>
before last year's storm, making the unmarked trailhead impossible to <br/>
find without prior local knowledge. This information was per a log by <br/>
the park ranger, who was the only person to find Spider's Web in the <br/>
last two years.<br/>
<br/>
The small drainage where the letterbox was is now a swamp. The two <br/>
biggest trees in the area fell. The lack of canopy allowed the <br/>
previously clear streambed to fill with briars. The fallen trees also <br/>
dammed up the drainage, making what had been a fairly dry area, very <br/>
wet and unpleasant.<br/>
<br/>
The log book is just now finally dry after several weeks. It was that <br/>
bad. It was actually sealed well, but it was 80% submersed in mud for <br/>
at least eleven months.<br/>
<br/>
Unless the owners reappear and object, I'm going to recycle that <br/>
stamp into a new placement in a different park in a few weeks. Not <br/>
many people found it originally in 2002 and there are plenty of new <br/>
letterboxers in the region who might like the stamp. I don't think <br/>
there is a decent spot in Sleepy Hole to plant anything now. If <br/>
anyone feels otherwise and plants in Sleepy Hole, I'm sure I'll enjoy <br/>
trying to find it.<br/>
<br/>
Happy Trails,<br/>
