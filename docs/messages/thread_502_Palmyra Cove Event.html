<p><font size="2">I really enjoyed myself too.</font>
<br/><font size="2">Great Job, Bev!</font>
</p>
<p><font size="2">I found pretty much every box that was placed.</font>
<br/><font size="2">All 5 of Bev's boxes (including mine!).</font>
<br/><font size="2">All 6 of the pirate boxes (including Joisey Tomato and Snail Mail).</font>
<br/><font size="2">I got Doug's beach box and the trash box.</font>
<br/><font size="2">I even found the mystery "what exit" box.</font>
<br/><font size="2">Missed Natty Bumpo's however.</font>
<br/><font size="2">With all that hiking around, I still managed to get a dozen or more exchanges.</font>
<br/><font size="2">I may have missed a few of you though, so I hope we get another chance at Plantapalooza.</font>
</p>
<p><font size="2">I felt guilty when I got home so I swung a pick in my new garden area for an hour and a half to try to make amends.</font>
<br/><font size="2">Thank God it started to lightning so I could come in!</font>
</p>
<p><font size="2">See you all soon.</font>

NJ Carole came from further North).  Bev (aka Tib-bee!), we owe you <br/>
our supreme gratitude.  We had a wodnerful  time, met some wonderful <br/>
new peoples and saw some old friends.  In case you were wondering why <br/>
there were so many of NJ's finest there, therer was a police station <br/>
right by the park.  I'd have to say it was the safest gathering yet!<br/>
<br/>
Exchanges can be exhausting, especially during a feeding frenzy!  <br/>
Imagine the monster mash.<br/>

I'm only disappointed it had to end and we had to head home.<br/>

And Jan, it wasn't hard to be nice to your daughter because she's <br/>

<div><span class="ygrps-yiv-705445513265113211-17102004"><font face="Arial" size="2">I'd like to thank 
everybody at yesterday's gathering for making me feel welcome, and for a 
wonderful time.  When I started letterboxing in January, the anonymity 
of letterboxing was one of my favorite aspects of it.  I thought it was 
great to just log in, and let nobody know who I was or where I was from.  I 
thought it was like a secret treasure hunt.  I would refuse to email 
anybody to tell them I found their box, assuming they should check on it to find 
out.  I wouldn't even leave comments in boxes.  I thought that was 
"too personal."</font></span></div><span class="ygrps-yiv-705445513265113211-17102004">
<div><font face="Arial" size="2"></font><font face="Arial" size="2"></font><br/><font face="Arial" size="2">Then I planted my first box, and discovered how much fun it 
was to hear from people.  I started to see another side of 
letterboxing.</font></div>

<div><span class="ygrps-yiv-705445513265113211-17102004"><font face="Arial" size="2">Then Silent Doug 
invited me to join this mailing list in August, and I started to discover how 
interesting you all are.  </font></span></div>

<div><span class="ygrps-yiv-705445513265113211-17102004"><font face="Arial" size="2">It was with some 
hesitation that I decided to attend the Palmyra Cove Gathering.  I wasn't 
sure what I was getting into...I wasn't sure if I'd get along with you all, if 
I'd feel like an outsider.  But I had an absolute BLAST.  From the 
moment Team Lightnin' Bug invited me to join them in their search for the Red 
Hat boxes, I was glad I went.  The day was SO much fun.  There was 
such a sincere camaraderie, and such a sense of wanting to just have a good 
time.  I am very glad I met everyone who attended yesterday.

If your going today and still have time to read this.  Box # 4 had to<br/>
be pulled for not being in a real "secure" spot.  I hope to get up<br/>
there before next weekend and hide it again and then post the clues. <br/>
Sorry 'bout this.  I didn't want the "landscappers" to find it and<br/>
trash it.  And of course box # 5 (the mystery box) is not there any<br/>
longer either.  :(  Maybe I will plant that one also somewhere else in<br/>
the park, too.<br/>

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I would also like to give a big thanks to letterboxingbee. The <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; gathering was great! Very well organized and a great locating.  <br/>
&gt; &gt; It <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; was so good to put faces with everyone's stamps and getting a <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; chance <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; to box with a lot of them. Also seeing Wanda and Pete there was <br/>
&gt; a <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; big <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; surprise too. I can't wait to make it back to that park to <br/>
&gt; finish <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; the <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; rest of the boxes. <br/>

<br/>
<br/>
Gee, thank you everyone for the wonderfull time we had (Me &amp; my<br/>
husband Rob).  Everyone was sooooo nice and it was great trying to<br/>
speak with each one of you.  Nice to meet some "event newbies", some<br/>
newbie letterboxers, and some veteran letterboxers I have already met.<br/>
 Wanda &amp; Pete, thanks for making the trip down again.  I know Wanda<br/>
wasn't feeling too well.  I'm glad you found your stamps again. <br/>
Thanks to the people who took the carving class.  I hope you all enjoy<br/>
your new stamp.  And thanks for the first impression of them all  :)<br/>
<br/>
I haven't even counted how many exchanges I got yesterday (:O)  Got<br/>
home last night and was just sooo beat!!  Gee, I wonder why.<br/>
<br/>
A  B I G  T H A N K  Y O U  to everyone who came yesterday.  It was, I<br/>
have to say, my favorite gathering.  Hopefully next year, it will be<br/>
even bigger and better.  We'll have to see about maybe holding it at<br/>
the same place.  As Silent Doug suggested, maybe we can pay the park<br/>
to have someone stay later to keep the classroom open longer.  &lt;Very<br/>
interesting&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Well, I'm off to go count my stamps from yesterday.  Do I get to count<br/>
the stamps on the event board twice (Ha ha ha) only kidding.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Thanks again everyone, I had a GREAT time with you all.<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; I'd like to thank everybody at yesterday's gathering<br/>
&gt; for making me feel<br/>
&gt; welcome, and for a wonderful time.  When I started<br/>
&gt; letterboxing in January,<br/>
&gt; the anonymity of letterboxing was one of my favorite<br/>
&gt; aspects of it.  I<br/>
&gt; thought it was great to just log in, and let nobody<br/>
&gt; know who I was or where<br/>
&gt; I was from.  I thought it was like a secret treasure<br/>
&gt; hunt.  I would refuse<br/>
&gt; to email anybody to tell them I found their box,<br/>
&gt; assuming they should check<br/>
&gt; on it to find out.  I wouldn't even leave comments<br/>
&gt; in boxes.  I thought that<br/>
&gt; was "too personal."<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Then I planted my first box, and discovered how much<br/>
&gt; fun it was to hear from<br/>
&gt; people.  I started to see another side of<br/>
&gt; letterboxing.<br/>
&gt;  <br/>
&gt; Then Silent Doug invited me to join this mailing<br/>
&gt; list in August, and I<br/>
&gt; started to discover how interesting you all are.  <br/>
&gt;  <br/>
&gt; It was with some hesitation that I decided to attend<br/>
&gt; the Palmyra Cove<br/>
&gt; Gathering.  I wasn't sure what I was getting<br/>
&gt; into...I wasn't sure if I'd get<br/>
&gt; along with you all, if I'd feel like an outsider. <br/>
&gt; But I had an absolute<br/>
&gt; BLAST.  From the moment Team Lightnin' Bug invited<br/>
&gt; me to join them in their<br/>
&gt; search for the Red Hat boxes, I was glad I went. <br/>
&gt; The day was SO much fun.<br/>
&gt; There was such a sincere camaraderie, and such a<br/>
&gt; sense of wanting to just<br/>
&gt; have a good time.  I am very glad I met everyone who<br/>
&gt; attended yesterday.  <br/>
&gt;  <br/>
&gt; Thanks so much, Bev, for hosting.  And thanks for<br/>
&gt; the truly helpful carving<br/>
&gt; tips (and the free material!!), and for setting up<br/>
&gt; such a great day!<br/>
&gt;  <br/>
&gt; I've found a new side of letterboxing once again,<br/>
&gt; and I look forward to<br/>
&gt; seeing you all again sometime soon!<br/>
&gt;  <br/>
&gt; Peace,<br/>

&gt; stamp"<br/>
