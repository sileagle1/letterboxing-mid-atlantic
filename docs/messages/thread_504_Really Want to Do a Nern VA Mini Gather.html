I'm thinking it would be fun to find a place where you can have a <br/>
big fire. Lake Fairfax has a place like that, but no shelter.  Also <br/>
there are no stamps there yet.  But there could be.  :-)  It's just <br/>
calling for stamps.  <br/>
<br/>
Reston has a rentable shelter.  Fountainhead has more trails.  <br/>
<br/>
I am thinking about Saturday, October 30th.  Which was once <br/>
mentioned before.  <br/>
<br/>
By the way, what do you tell the park your event is?  Hmmm.  <br/>
<br/>
Any ideas out there?  <br/>

<br/>
That park should be great for an event. They treat my orienteering club very<br/>
well for our annual visits. The geocachers had a big event there in June.<br/>
The last time I counted, there were 7 letterboxes and 17 geocaches in the<br/>
park, so the park is OK with our hobbies. They can't "not know" about them<br/>
when there are that many. It's a big park, so there should be room to hide a<br/>
few more letterboxes. To my knowledge, no letterboxes nor geocaches have<br/>
been plundered at Fountainhead, knock on wood.<br/>
<br/>
The park website with shelter rental info and such is at nvrpa.org. The big<br/>
problem with Fountainhead is that they lock the gates for the winter<br/>
starting November 13. After that, you can park on the entrance road and walk<br/>
in. That won't affect a 10/30 event, but those of us who miss it might<br/>
choose to wait until Spring to get the ones you plant for the event. If you<br/>
plant any on the MTB Trail, make sure that you are very alert when walking<br/>
that trail. The bikers ride very fast and don't look for hikers, since there<br/>
are plenty of hiker-only trails. Make sure that all your spots are good ones<br/>
well off the trail, as all the trails are very busy.<br/>
<br/>
I doubt I could make such an event, but it would be a cool thing to offer.<br/>
Good luck if you try it.<br/>
