only way to live after 40! Bev and Rob you did a great<br/>
job! I know how much work these things take and thanks<br/>
so much for planning, organizing and hosting this<br/>
event. And all of those great boxes! Thanks to<br/>
everyone else who placed boxes for the event. I helped<br/>
plant the Red Hat boxes so didn't think there would be<br/>
much for me to hunt, boy was I wrong. Doug and<br/>
Jennifer went way "out of the box" with their clean up<br/>
idea. Great thinking.<br/>
<br/>
Just got in from boxing with Judy all day. We found a<br/>
bunch of great boxes, in spite of having to drive all<br/>
over Jersey making no left turns! We managed to find a<br/>
couple of way cool dinsaurs, a wolf paw print and a<br/>
neat little mouse hiding in a nature center in<br/>
Rancocas, a beauiful Tree of Life and the Inner<br/>
Coastal Plain of NJ, which I guess means I have to<br/>
find the rest of NJ. If only it wasn't so dang hard to<br/>
drive in! Beautiful day, great parks, stamps and<br/>
trails. Thanks all you NJ boxers!<br/>
