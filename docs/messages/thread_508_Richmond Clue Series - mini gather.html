#2 and #3 in Dorey Park were both missing. I was planning to leave a<br/>
hitchhiker for you all to find, but there was nothing to leave the HH in. I<br/>
had found the whole Dorey Park series right after they were placed, and the<br/>
spots were easy to find again, so unfortunately I'm confident they're gone.<br/>
I was carpooling with a friend who wanted to stop in York River on the way<br/>
home (plus I was tired, long O-course) so I didn't have a chance to get to<br/>
#1, #4, nor #5.<br/>
<br/>
Sorry for the news. I hope you have a fun event. I wish I could make it.<br/>

I am going to try to replace these boxes.<br/>
<br/>
I did not participate in placing these boxes, but I found all of them <br/>
soon after they were placed.  There was a large group involved in <br/>
creating this series but the main person who I believe coordinated <br/>
this series seemed to become inactive soon after this series was <br/>
placed.  She has not been active finding or planting letterboxes, nor <br/>
responding to e-mails.<br/>

                    <div id="ygrps-yiv-1163456326">I suspect the mini-gathering is going to find out the hard way about <br/>
the other 22 boxes. Hopefully, these will be the only two casualties.<br/>
<br/>
I know that #3 (four attempts overall to find, very tough landmarks), <br/>
and #7 in Poor Farm were in place in late August. I had a DNF then on <br/>
#6 (more landmark problems). The hiding spot for #2 looked OK <br/>
visually from the trail with a big stack of sticks in the hole, but I <br/>
didn't stop to inspect it. I didn't pass 1,4,5 (found last winter) on <br/>
the August hike and I haven't tried 8,9,10 yet.<br/>
<br/>
Good luck to the gathering. I wish I could join you.<br/>
