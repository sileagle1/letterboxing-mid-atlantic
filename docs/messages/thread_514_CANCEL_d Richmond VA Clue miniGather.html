Sat Oct 23. (Besides I'm still nursing a tooth extraction - and the <br/>

But I'll be retired on Apr 1 2005 and will seek these boxes then and <br/>
make a point of replacing (with permission) any that have gone <br/>

the game pieces could be kept in tact!<br/>

Except for some boxing in BC Canada the first week of Nov, I hope to <br/>
air out my hiking boots until next spring and get some new Stencil <br/>
Blades in my stocking so I can create a supply of stamps for <br/>
planting, HH, and PLB'g in my retirement.<br/>

All y'all have a great weekend.<br/>
