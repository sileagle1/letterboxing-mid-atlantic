                    <div id="ygrps-yiv-1528946517">Hello- Leafcutters and Lotus spent the entire weekend letterboxing-- <br/>
I am exhausted but rewarded :)  Dad and I did some box managment-  be <br/>
warned the John Fries Rebellion box is hard to find now that the <br/>
leaves have fallen down-- I will be revamping the clues soon.  <br/>
<br/>
So over the weekend we found:<br/>
<br/>
Jumping Logs- creative stamp<br/>
W.W. Hallowe'en Fly By- Just in time!<br/>
Terrible Tigers Tiny Treasures- Found one of our own HH's here.<br/>
Bolts n Holes- nice little park and stamps.<br/>
Ben Franklin-Scientist-- missing the last time we tried, now it's <br/>
returned and great.<br/>
A Quaker Yarn-- The is an "oldie" but a goodie box-- lots of fun.<br/>
Body Parts-- Wow!  I never knew that the Wissahickon Park was so <br/>
beautiful<br/>
The Pennypacker series- three cute boxes.<br/>
The Lost Cat Series-- it was so much fun &amp; so close to home! and <br/>
indigo vulture- we love your new personal stamp.  The third box-- <br/>
gave us a scare, a squirrel had decided to live in the tree- and well <br/>
we searched around the one end and out pops this angry squirrel <br/>
running right at us-- I nearly fell into the water! <br/>
Cabin By the Lake-- fun walk, but no stamp-- so a question- do you <br/>
count this in your PFX count??  I am not sure what to do-- we stamped <br/>
their log book, but there was no stamp for us to stamp ours- what to <br/>
do?<br/>
<br/>
We also released two hitch hikers:<br/>
Who gives a hoot HH<br/>
Fighting Owls HH <br/>
<br/>
So we tried to pack in as much letterboxing as possible-- I think we <br/>
succeeded.  <br/>

Oh good! Glad the rehider put it in the right spot, even though he<br/>
didn't actually know where the spot was... :)<br/>
