<div>Today, I fulfilled a longburning ambition and climbed the highest mountain in my state, Maryland.  Backbone Mountain, only 3,360 feet above sea level, and I didn't have to climb much of that on the trail, but it was still an achievement.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Anyway, at the peak there's a marker and a mailbox containing a notebook for people to sign their names and add comments, and a stack of certificates you could take and fill in to prove you were there.  Backbone Mountain isn't all that tall, but it's also the back of beyond as far as Maryland is concerned (in the extreme southwestern corner of the state; you actually have to start your climb in West Virginia and finish it in Maryland), so it's not frequently climbed.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Anyway, I thought it would be a perfect place for a letterbox (next time I climb); also, from some stuff I've seen online, it seems there's a group of people who make a hobby of climbing to the highest points of every state in the union.  Anybody ever encounter them or hear of them?</div></html></div>

<div>I believe they are called the Highpointers Club.  There is a website at <a href="http://www.highpointersclub.org/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">www.highpointersclub.org</a> though I could not connect to it right now.  Lots on Google though.  </div>

club. One guy fianally conquered Mt. Ranier and is<br/>
showing us slides at our monthly meeting. He has 48<br/>
peaks now. I had a box planted on Backbone Mountain in<br/>
WV near the windmills. I just got an MIA report which<br/>
surpirsed the heck out of me as it's not an area that<br/>
gets many visitors. I am hoping to get down there in<br/>
the spring to confirm. <br/>
