time am not able to move him along and he needs to visit as many <br/>
boxers and boxes in as many states as possible before election day.  <br/>
Sen. Kerry has already visited VA, PA, DE, MD, DC, IN, OH.  <br/>
<br/>
If you have plans to visit a letterbox somewhere other then the <br/>
states that have already been visited please contact me off-list so I <br/>
can send Sen. Kerry to you to plant before election day.<br/>

in your county as they each count as a 'vote', not to mention <br/>
inviting all the local boxers over to your house Sat AM for a 'stamp-<br/>
in'.  <br/>

I already did my part when I ushered him out of a park in Vienna VA <br/>
and got him 12? votes in 24 hrs.<br/>
