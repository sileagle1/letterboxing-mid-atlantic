                    <div id="ygrps-yiv-727529394">The Secret Service Agent at the metal detector would not allow <br/>
me to take my Leatherman into the John Kerry Rally on the Ben <br/>
Franklin Parkway.  For those who are unfamiliar with the $70 <br/>
Leatherman Wave, it is the ultimate pocket multi-tool containing, <br/>
scissors, pliers, standard &amp; phillips screwdrivers, can opener, <br/>
file, and yes, a knife.<br/>
After a 20 minute hike from the car and a half-hour wait in the <br/>
metal detector line, my choice, if I wanted to see the rally, was <br/>
throw it away or take it back to the car.  The Agent offered me <br/>
another option.<br/>
"Some guys just find a place to put it out there until later."<br/>
I got out of line and walked outside the Police cordon.  Twenty <br/>
yards away was a 15' x 15' grassy patch with a few scrawny <br/>
shrubs.  I watched for a few minutes as a parade of men walked <br/>
by the patch and, not-too-subtly dropped their pocket knives and <br/>
nail clippers into the bushes.  I also noted that others were <br/>
watching this parade.  My precious Leatherman would not be <br/>
added to this Swiss Army gold mine.<br/>
Next to the patch was a 6 foot wall that separated the sidewalk <br/>
from a parking lot.  The top of the wall was a long-neglected <br/>
planter where flats of annuals were once placed.<br/>
I hopped up on the wall and watched the crowds file through the <br/>
metal detectors.  And guess what - there was just enough space <br/>
in the gap for... a Leatherman!<br/>
I hid the tool and returned to the metal detector.<br/>
After speeches by Bill Clinton, John Kerry and (what seemed <br/>
like) every Democrat in the free world, I returned to retrieve my <br/>
Leatherman.  Unfortunately for many others, the Swiss Army <br/>
cache had been raided.<br/>
Choosing a good hiding place is a crucial skill in Letterboxing  - <br/>
and life.  Letterboxing saved my Leatherman.<br/>

rarely let me pass through to the gate with my apparently lethal <br/>
plastic key chain. I would excuse myself, go into the Ladies and hide <br/>
it on a small ledge over the mirror. It was always there when I <br/>
returned to retrieve it. So much for airport security.<br/>
