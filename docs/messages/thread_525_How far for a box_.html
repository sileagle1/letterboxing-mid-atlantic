Not a bad drive in nice weather. It's a 5 mile loop. However, the <br/>

I suppose that some people would schedule a box series like this for <br/>
the summer so that they could drive. Others might consider it a nice <br/>
little hike.<br/>
<br/>
How many of you would consider walking 5 miles for a box series?  How <br/>
far have you walked/hiked for a box? As an aside, how long have you <br/>
spent looking for a box that you knew 'was around there somewhere'?<br/>
<br/>
For me it was 3 hours. I walked up and down different roads and <br/>
trails and toward the end, near the box, discovered that I didn't <br/>
have my compass for the directions and paces. I'd been walking for <br/>
well over 2 hours and refused to leave till I had the goods. I found <br/>
the box. I also lost my cell phone in the woods that day. But I got <br/>
the box! <br/>

                    <div id="ygrps-yiv-823087068">Hi Gillian,<br/>
My very first letterbox was on a four and a half mile hike - a little <br/>
over two miles to get there and then the same two plus miles back.  <br/>
There was only one box.  It was along a path that I walk all the time <br/>
but prior to that I hadn't known about letterboxing.  Anyway, it <br/>
takes me about one hour and 10 minutes to walk over four miles.<br/>
<br/>
Then a few weeks ago I was searching for the second and third box in <br/>
the Nolde Forest series and I walked for over three hours before <br/>
finding the third box.  I had to come back another day to find the <br/>
second one.<br/>
<br/>
I think the point I am trying to make is that I will walk whatever it <br/>
takes to find my little treasures.  A five mile walk for a series of <br/>
boxes sounds perfectly ok to me!<br/>

Canada. . . is that far enough?<br/>
I understand the MMM was estimated at 30 miles for the 130+ boxes, so <br/>
I probably did 20 miles for the 95 I got in 3.5 days<br/>
<br/>
But in one day, for clue(series), it is not so much the distance as <br/>
the terrain.  One Mile in pine paved VA vs rocky CT and level vs <br/>
exhausting makes a big difference.  So although mile/box/mile/box is <br/>
one approach I'd prefer 30min/box/30min/box (which is still about <br/>
mile=30min of moderate terrain.)<br/>

<div><font color="#000080" face="Eras Demi ITC">You really need to hit the Nolan 
Trail series in Newport News, VA (Mariner's Museum).  It's pretty much 
exactly what you describe, except for that one really hard clue that doesn't 
make any sense and then turns out not to mean anything anyway! (at least not 
that we could tell...)  But don't they all have one of those?</font></div>

  series?  How <br/>far have you walked/hiked for a box? As an aside, how 
  long have you <br/>spent looking for a box that you knew 'was around there 
  somewhere'?<br/><br/>For me it was 3 hours. I walked up and down different roads 
  and <br/>trails and toward the end, near the box, discovered that I didn't 
  <br/>have my compass for the directions and paces. I'd been walking for 
  <br/>well over 2 hours and refused to leave till I had the goods. I found 
  <br/>the box. I also lost my cell phone in the woods that day. But I got 
  <br/>the box! <br/><br/>Gillian<br/></tt></blockquote><br/></span></blockquote></html>

</span></blockquote>Oh, good, it's not just me. One would think that after three summers <br/>
of hiking after boxes with the full intention of increasing the <br/>
whole cardio-vascular bit, one would see some increase of stamina, <br/>
but nooooo. And the worst, stupidest part? I have the hardest time <br/>
when going on maintainance of &gt;&gt;my own boxes&lt;&lt;. When planting my <br/>
last series, I really thought I would die on the spot and distant <br/>
future finders would have the added thrill of a skeleton by the edge <br/>
of the Hudson River. Checked the topo map on returning home. <br/>
Elevation change of about 600 ft. from clifftop to riverbank.<br/>
(another tip to those going after Palisades Platitudes - <br/>
the "boulders" are as big as refrigerators, and crawling with <br/>
millipedes a half-foot long, which always crawl right to where you <br/>
wanted to put your hand just then to keep from falling. tell me <br/>
again how much fun this hobby is?)<br/>
But I have to say, I really appreciate having a box at the end of a <br/>
long hike to keep me going, otherwise I'd take five steps into the <br/>
woods, say, "Very nice. Very pretty. Let's go home." Now I can <br/>
say,"gasp.... pant.... must.... gasp... get.... pant... box....."<br/>

one letterbox. It was a box along a river in California and you were<br/>
supposed to take a boat to it! But he decided to hike it. <br/>
<br/>
If I am going to do 5 miles or more, I prefer it to be a series. When<br/>
I find a lone box on a long hike like that, I usually take along a box<br/>
to hide on the same trail. This makes it more enjoyable for future box<br/>
hunters. Now they have 2 letterboxes on the long trail. :-)<br/>
<br/>
There is one box in the Seattle area called Poo Poo Point. It was only<br/>
about 4 miles, but it was up hill all the way. I planted the Catnap<br/>
letterbox at about the halfway mark. <br/>
