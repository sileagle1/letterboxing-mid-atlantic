the ferry, crowds getting off, venders all over the place. The one <br/>

hope all is cool in the NW Bronx.  It seems like there is the <br/>
potential for many a box up there.<br/>

Jan - we also enjoyed meeting you out by the Hickory Dickory Dock and <br/>
will hopefully see you on the trails soon.  Our regret is that we did <br/>
not have a chance to say hello to your daughter with the feeding <br/>

&gt; Hi Jan,<br/>
&gt; I remember you and your daughter, and the doggie &lt;s&gt;. Look forward <br/>
&gt; to getting to know you. That was my first gathering and I was <br/>
&gt; overwhelmed by the stamping frenzy, as someone called it. I <br/>
probably <br/>
&gt; had that deer in the headlights look. <br/>

&gt; &gt; Hello Miss Moon,<br/>
&gt; &gt; We met briefly at the Palmyra Cove gathering also.  I was there <br/>
&gt; with <br/>
&gt; &gt; my daughter and her guide dog so I didn't get the chance to be <br/>
&gt; really <br/>
&gt; &gt; social - my daughter tends to be the outgoing one in this pair.  <br/>
I <br/>
&gt; am <br/>
&gt; &gt; a new member of the Red Hat Boxers also and look forward to <br/>
&gt; getting <br/>
&gt; &gt; to chat with you soon.<br/>

&gt; &gt; Welcome,<br/>

&gt; I wondered about NYC urban boxes this summer when I went there for <br/>
&gt; the day. No boxes where I was going. When I got there, I <br/>
understood. <br/>
&gt; I knew that there wouldn't be any at Statue of Liberty or Ellis <br/>
&gt; Island. I did wonder about Battery Park. I don't see how. Lines for <br/>
&gt; the ferry, crowds getting off, venders all over the place. The one <br/>
&gt; place that might take a box, by the veterans memorials and grassy <br/>
&gt; area, was under construction. Those urban box placements seem tough.<br/>

you <br/>
&gt; &gt; believe I actually checked out Grand Central Station yesterday? I <br/>
&gt; &gt; can say the location because there was :::NO PLACE:::, no nook, <br/>
no <br/>
&gt; &gt; cranny, phones built into the wall. A total bust. I may be aiming <br/>
&gt; &gt; too high. lol Checking out another place tomorrow after work. I <br/>
&gt; will <br/>
&gt; &gt; probably be having foot surgery before or around the end of the <br/>

<div>Hi, thanks.....up here where I live there are lots of places, but I want visitors to the city to look for the boxes and I don't think most of them will come all the way up here, even though it is a beautiful area that shows NYC is not just tall buildings with lots of congestion and no green. I was thinking recently that I might do a couple up here, but my main interest is Manhattan. </div>

<div>The one I put in Central Park is missing. I may or may not replace it. If you saw the other notes, you know why I am interested mainly in Manhattan. There are places on Staten Island I know of. I have another one in Manhattan and just placed another one. If there's one in Brooklyn it's not listed on the lbna site unless it's that hitchiker placed by someone named Highlander and among the permanently missing apparently. We just don't have enough local boxers to put one someplace like Pelham Park. It might get one or two stamps and then just sit there. I want people from other places to hunt for them and enjoy seeing spots in Manhattan they might not otherwise ever see. All the posts I've seen about urban boxes have all been people who want to look for boxes while in the city for another reason and they ask about Manhattan. Plus I like the challenge!! Thanks for the suggestions! </div>
