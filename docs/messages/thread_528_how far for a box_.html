                    <div id="ygrps-yiv-73861621"><div>I know for us, 2 miles is about the limit- its not the distance its that it takes us so long to decipher the clues and agree on where to go.  </div>
<div>I like it when the placer tells us either how long a hike it will be or at least time (then we multiply by 3 to find "our" time).  We've tried many boxes with no indication of time, but its nice to have an idea.  Sometimes we thought the clues sounded complicated and yet the hike was short- other times it was just the opposite.</div>
<div>One box we ruled out before we started- there was no mention of time and the clues kept saying "eventually you'll see this", "eventually you'll see that".  To us it seemed like it would be hours and hours.  Maybe not, but we never tried it.</div>
<div>I also like when the clues tell you how to get back to the place you parked.  Is it a loop or do you have to back track?</div>
<div>Other than that we don't want too much (do we?).</div>
<div>Enjoy.</div>

mile expedition would be tops and it would have to be a series to <br/>
keep his interest (hey, he's a 10 yr old).  However, with Troopers <br/>
like Eagle Bob or the Hairy Leggers, a 9 mile rocky hike with climbs <br/>
is not out of the question, though shortcuts can reduce that distance.<br/>
