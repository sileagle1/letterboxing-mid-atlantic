<br/>
My letterboxing database is almost complete. Before it is released I <br/>
would like to solicit some volunteers to beta test the platform <br/>
(probably within the next month).<br/>
<br/>
Some of the functionality is listed below:<br/>
PFX count (of course!) with the "PFXHE" nomenclature<br/>
PFX Log Book<br/>
Maintenance Log Book (this will include any boxes you adopted)<br/>
Hitchhiker Log Book<br/>
Event Log Book<br/>
Contact Database<br/>
Statistic Page<br/>
Export to MS Excel<br/>
Import from MS Excel (currently in development)<br/>
<br/>
The PFX Log book can be sorted by ascending/descending order of any <br/>
field you choose (date, placer, Box name, Location, etc.)<br/>
<br/>
The Maintenance module will keep track of all the maintenance done <br/>
(or needs to be done) on each box planted and/or adopted. Currently I <br/>
am working on a sort by "county" feature that will print out a list <br/>
of boxes planted in a specific area. I think it will help you <br/>
organize your maintenance weekends by locale.<br/>
<br/>
The Hitchhiker module will keep track of all your hitchhiker travels <br/>
for each box.<br/>
<br/>
The Events module simply lists all your events attended (nothing <br/>
fancy here).<br/>
<br/>
The Contact module will allow you to build a list of fellow boxers <br/>
detailing their trail name (sorry, no multiple personalities <br/>
allowed!) mailing address, phone, email, and a list of their boxes.<br/>
<br/>
The statistic module will give you a breakdown on your success rate <br/>
according to your attempts vs. number of finds. Also being developed <br/>
is a breakdown of the types of boxes (postal, virtual, and personal <br/>
travelers collected). <br/>
<br/>
The big question is: what am I missing and what would other users <br/>
want have in a functional database????<br/>
<br/>
Please contact me if you would like to be added to the distribution <br/>
list.<br/>
<br/>
thanks, Hexacat</div>
