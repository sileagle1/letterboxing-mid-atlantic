<div>They are tough. I checked out Battery Park. I found a possible place away from the construction....I'm still not sure about it. It seems like it would be easy because all the people are looking at the scenery and taking pictures of each other and really not paying any attention to what you do. I went there with a couple of boxes, one to be placed as a magnet box and one velcro but I just felt too self conscious. I felt like everyone would see me place it, or the old guy with fishing pole and nothing to look at would be looking straight at me when I did it and come get it when I left.  hah</div>
<div> </div>
<div>I :::have::: placed two already.........one is missing and I have to check it out. I know no one saw me place it and I don't see how anyone could have seen it. The other one is still there and I placed one this afternoon. I have to do the clues. The place is great. To place them in places that I think are interesting and cool, *and* won't be found is a challenge. I have been doing some research and think I might have another couple of good places. There are I think, four other boxes here, placed by other people, but two of them are in places that visitors to the city might not want to take the time to go to, or not have the time, in my humble opinion. </div>

<div>Ain't that the truth. The last time I was there I noticed the people who sell all that junk were sitting there with the stuff in the huge bags they use to transport it, unopened. They were still selling, wanting you to come over so they could show you what they have. The cops must have cracked down. They used to have it all out of the bags. </div>
<div>If the construction is EVER finished, I'll be interested to see what they've done. I thought the park was fine before. </div>
