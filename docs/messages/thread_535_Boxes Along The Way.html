                    <div id="ygrps-yiv-750864753">When I went through CT a few weeks ago, 84 was a mess in the Waterbury area<br/>
for some construction that looked to be settling in for a long project. I<br/>
don't think there is any fast way through CT, especially on a Friday<br/>
afternoon. You didn't mention a specific town that you were aiming for<br/>
anyway (or does "MG" refer to a letterbox gathering that I haven't paid<br/>
attention to).<br/>
<br/>
If 84 does work for you, Tarywile Park #1 in Danbury CT might be manageable.<br/>
The whole series of four is a hefty bit of hiking, but the first box is real<br/>
close to parking. I recall it would be about 10 minutes from exit to<br/>
parking, 15 minutes to the letterbox and back, and 10 minutes back to the<br/>
exit. The stamp is good and the viewpoint just beyond the placement is good<br/>
too. Those reading along with more time and energy on a future trip should<br/>
consider the whole series; it's a fantastic park and hike.<br/>
<br/>
Have a safe trip.<br/>

&gt; Being that I-95 is none stop traffic you do have other options.  You<br/>
&gt; can take 81 to 84 and that goes straight through CT.  And then just<br/>
&gt; take 84 into Mansfield and you can do some monsters since there are<br/>
&gt; only a few days left for them.  Just a thought.<br/>
