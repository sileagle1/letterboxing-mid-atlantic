&gt; <br/>
&gt; Thank you to everyone who kindly took the time to<br/>
&gt; answer my late request.  I appreciate it and<br/>
&gt; appreciate the kind offer of Lightning Bug to meet<br/>
&gt; up<br/>
&gt; to do an exchange!  Unfortunately, I won't be able<br/>
&gt; to<br/>
&gt; meet up as I will be traveling Friday and my return<br/>
&gt; trip (either Sun. or Mon.)will depend solely upon<br/>
&gt; how<br/>
&gt; I'm feeling.  Perhaps some other time- it sounds<br/>
&gt; lovely!<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; To the one person who saw fit to email me in a less<br/>
&gt; than kind manner about my request, I really don't<br/>
&gt; owe<br/>
&gt; an explanation but I will give one.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; As of last evening I thought I'd have to cancel my<br/>
&gt; trip because my health has taken a turn for the<br/>
&gt; worse<br/>
&gt; lately.  I was afraid to travel, especially alone,<br/>
&gt; and<br/>
&gt; felt this might be too much for me. I realized that<br/>
&gt; I<br/>
&gt; didn't want to live in fear of what might happen if<br/>
&gt; I<br/>
&gt; got ill or give up letterboxing, so I made the<br/>
&gt; decision to go for it and made the last minute<br/>
&gt; request<br/>
&gt; to the list.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Since you feel the need to know, I usually heavily<br/>
&gt; investigate the boxes I search for-both because of<br/>
&gt; my<br/>
&gt; limitations and because I like challenges.  This<br/>
&gt; time,<br/>
&gt; I just did not have time to do so with last minute<br/>
&gt; preparations to complete.  My bad, I know.  But, for<br/>
&gt; someone with multiple mystery boxes under my belt<br/>
&gt; from<br/>
&gt; what I would consider the best boxers/planters out<br/>
&gt; there your comments seemed a bit harsh and frankly,<br/>
&gt; mean, since you don't know me or my situation.  I<br/>
&gt; won't allow you to rain on my parade, sorry.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; As for all the other kind souls out there- please<br/>
&gt; send<br/>
&gt; me your good wishes tomorrow morning/afternoon for a<br/>
&gt; safe, uneventful trip.  For those going to the MG, I<br/>
&gt; look forward to meeting you or seeing you again, as<br/>
&gt; the case may be.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Thanks again!<br/>
&gt; Amy<br/>
