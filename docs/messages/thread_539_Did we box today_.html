that some of you have a life, or, at least another life aside from <br/>
letterboxing. How scandalous.<br/>
<br/>
On Friday, my 14 year old went to a garage band concert. Mom sat all <br/>
night on the edge of her seat awaiting the call for a ride home, <br/>
which would indicate that he had, indeed, survived the experience.<br/>
<br/>
Last night we both attended a large, well planned, well thought out <br/>
multi-generational Halloween party. About 50 people between the ages <br/>
of five and seventy attended. There was a scavenger hunt!<br/>
<br/>
Today I went letterboxing.  Finally, a valid excuse for this post. I <br/>
picked up the Five Bridges of Batsto box. A beautiful day, a very <br/>
nice trail.<br/>
<br/>
Finding the trail was a real head basher. I walked to and fro through <br/>
Batsto Historic Village looking for the yellow/orange trail head. I <br/>
asked others for directions to no avail. Finally I spotted a forest <br/>
ranger near the visitors' center who enlightened me. It was all the <br/>
way over on the other side of the property. I must have <br/>
looked like I was going to cry because he offered me a ride. I took <br/>
it.<br/>
<br/>
Off in the other direction. I hunted Batona Trail Surprise. I was to <br/>
walk a third of a mile and pace in five directions. I think that I <br/>
walked much further, and on the way back stopped at every fallen log <br/>
across the trail and paced the compass points. Not today. The sun had <br/>
fallen behind the trees and I hurried home so that I could fulfill <br/>
the expectation of littler hunters seeking treasure at my door.<br/>
