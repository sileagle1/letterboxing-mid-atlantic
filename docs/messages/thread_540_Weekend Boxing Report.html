get some boxing done.<br/>
<br/>
Friday night I threw a surpise 50th Birthday Party for<br/>
Mr. Irene. He was completely shocked and thrilled. It<br/>
earned me major brownie points, not that I need them.<br/>
I am after all..me!<br/>
<br/>
Saturday evening I reported for duty at Graeme Park to<br/>
volunteer with their Ghostly Gathering. First I found<br/>
all of Cyclonics GG boxes but ran out of daylight<br/>
before I found Jennifer's box so will have to go back.<br/>
It was my first time there and I really enjoyed the<br/>
place. Plus I got to hear Cyclonic screaming at the<br/>
hapless tourists and scare the bejesus out of them all<br/>
night. That got over around 11:00.<br/>
<br/>
Sunday Dude and I met up with Janila and Barney, Team<br/>
Little Dog, to plant some boxes in Tyler Park and try<br/>
again to find both of Muk-Luk's Schofield Ford Covered<br/>
Bridge boxes. We found box#2 easily enough but the<br/>
first box eluded us. I think we were pretty darn close<br/>
but no luck. <br/>
<br/>
Now back to work, boo!!!!<br/>

Hike right past the South Mountain Series.  As Tom did not accompany <br/>
me when I planted them back in August, I said things like "the Spring <br/>
Peeper is begind that tree" and "The Mountain Laurel si right <br/>
there".  Tom, of course, knows where the Alien Spaceship and the H³ <br/>
are.  I'd have liked to check the boxes, but we were on a mission to <br/>
finish the hike.<br/>
<br/>
Sunday, we had Church in the AM and then the Allentown Halloweed <br/>
Parade in the afternoon.  We were on the boob tube for our 15 seconds <br/>
of fame yet again!  ;-)  We assembled the U2/Doves box for P'ooza to <br/>
ship to Irene at lunch today.<br/>
<br/>
I am totally stoked for a mystery adventure next weekend!<br/>

<div>That's a tiny find.  </div>
<div> </div>
<div>Since there are 10 times more geocaches out there than letterboxes, and they get confused when they find ours, it can be a good idea to check out what geocaches are in an area where you are planting so they aren't close together.  </div>

letterboxes; it might have been on the front of the log.  If you're <br/>
curious enough, try a site called Buxley's Geocaching Waypoints. The <br/>
geocaches are represented by red dots on a map.  Select country, <br/>
state, region. At that point, if you click on a clear area, no dots, <br/>
it will zoom further.<br/>

&gt; Nope, the journal clearly indicated it was a geocache and directed <br/>
us to www.geocache.com.  It just wasn't what we'd expected, and there <br/>
weren't any other boxes anywhere in the vicinity; even the mystery <br/>
boxes locally are clearly not there.  Hmmm.  Krash went online to see <br/>
if geocache.com could help, but of course there aren't any clues and <br/>
we don't have GPS!<br/>

&gt; Or it could have been a letterbox micro box that was<br/>
&gt; missing it's stamp. Did you check the website to see<br/>
&gt; if htere were any boxes ro possible mystery boxes<br/>
&gt; there?<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I agree, sounds kinda small for a geo-cache.<br/>

                    <div id="ygrps-yiv-1480034892">A trend in geocaching is to go to "microcaches". The thought is that <br/>
some places are too busy to hide a full sized cache, or it can't be <br/>
camoflauged adequately, or maybe the hider just wants to make it <br/>
harder. The pencil is just for the log.<br/>
<br/>
If you'd like (and haven't already looked this up yourself), post <br/>
some info on the park (name, town, road intersection), and I'll see <br/>
what's nearby among caches.<br/>
