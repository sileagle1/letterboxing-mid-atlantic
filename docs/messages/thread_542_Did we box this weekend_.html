"Shiver Me Timbers" should have been there. it was last found around <br/>
mid Oct. "Coat of Arms" has been reported missing (on two occasions). <br/>
I will be heading down to Lewes for Thanksgiving and will check on <br/>
them.<br/>

out a few times and come home without a stamp that I wanted.  And a <br/>
week or two later someone would report to the list that they had <br/>
found the box in good shape and right where it was supposed to be. <br/>
What the heck, it happens.<br/>
