<br/>
I've been so busy this week, but I wanted to be sure to check in and <br/>
let everyone know what a fun event it was last weekend at <br/>
Plantapalooza. Gwenllian and I really enjoyed seeing everyone again <br/>
and meeting new people. Tyler State Park is really lovely! We were <br/>
excited to find a great spot for our Steely Dan box. We can't wait to <br/>
go back and hunt down all the other great boxes. If you look for <br/>
Steely Dan this weekend, you'll be getting pretty basic directions to <br/>
the box. I'm hoping to come up with more creative clues by next week <br/>
sometime to improve the box experience and inject some Steely Dan <br/>
coolness to the whole hunt!<br/>
<br/>
I especially loved meeting up for dinner at Isaac Newton's - what a <br/>
great idea that was! If you are heading out to hunt these boxes - do <br/>
not forget to plan your apres hunt meal at Isaac Newton's! While you <br/>
are there, look for Specific Gravity, planted by Mizscarlet in the <br/>
back of the parking lot.<br/>
<br/>
Irene, thanks a ton for the excellent idea of Battle of the Bands, <br/>
and for all your work planting the boxes that were sent to you!<br/>
<br/>
By the way, this is a belated announcement that I have planted a <br/>
limited edition bonus box at Saddler's Legacy - it will be available <br/>
until Thanksgiving. So, if you're headed to Saddler's Legacy, you can <br/>
get two for the price of one! Directions are in the logbook.<br/>
