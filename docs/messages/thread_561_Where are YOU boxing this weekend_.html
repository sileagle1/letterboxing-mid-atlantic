If the weather clears up some, I'm going to try to get three new <br/>
boxes near home. Someone other than me has caught on that Palisades <br/>
Interstate Park is a great place to plant. (Heads up, bergeners! <br/>
they're listed as manhattan!) That makes 9 if we include the mystery <br/>
boxes. (whoah- did I drop a hint?? whoops)<br/>
My Tenafly box has worked its way to #2 on my "to check" list and <br/>
it's right along the way, so that "needs done" as the MidWesterners <br/>
say.<br/>
And I want to scout out a new park for a possible plant. They made <br/>
the garbage on the site into art instead of hauling it out. This I <br/>
have got to see.<br/>
And for brain-work, I'm sorting out the ins and outs of #1 on my "to <br/>
check" list. Has ANYONE seen my Physiography cuckoo clue? I think it <br/>
either got trashed with 105, or someone moved it out of the series.<br/>
So that's probably a near future replant.<br/>

first two are cool quick scores.  Have fun.<br/>

&gt; though, her unborn baby seems to have suffered no<br/>
&gt; injuries but the<br/>
&gt; pregnancy does present complications to the surgery.<br/>
&gt;  Anyway, looks as<br/>
&gt; though letterboxing will be taking a back seat for a<br/>
&gt; little while<br/>
&gt; unless I have time to search for the handful of<br/>
&gt; boxes that are in<br/>
&gt; Chester County when I am visiting her.  On the other<br/>
&gt; hand, it looks<br/>
&gt; like a great time to practice carving and maybe<br/>
&gt; stock up on boxes to<br/>
&gt; plant when I can get back outside.<br/>

&gt; &gt; Maryland tomorrow.<br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; I think there are about 10 there now.<br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; I haven't been out boxing in a bit.<br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; I have a number of stamps carved and series planned,<br/>
&gt; &gt; but have been <br/>
&gt; &gt; busy with this and that.  Once I hit F200 (My goal<br/>
&gt; &gt; for the end of my <br/>
&gt; &gt; 2nd year of boxing), I just kinda hit a wall.<br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; So, if I'm good and finish a photo album project<br/>
&gt; &gt; tonight, I can go <br/>
&gt; &gt; boxing tomorrow!<br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; Poison Ivy is Baaaaack!<br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; Look out.<br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; Box Like Nobody's Lookin!<br/>

Lock Ridge is definitely gonzo.<br/>
Looked twice.<br/>
No mistake where it should have been.<br/>
"Just Flyin' Through in Allentown is also missing, so don't bother.<br/>

Rich,<br/>
You wanna replace Lock Ridge or me?<br/>
How bout I do that one and you think about Flyin Through?<br/>
<br/>
I think I managed to shortcut Kalmbach by reading the clues, comparing<br/>
to the map and cheating.<br/>

If you dig around enough, you can find the plaque at Reimert Memorial<br/>

&gt; could come up with the correct location.  So I headed back down and <br/>
copied <br/>
&gt; down the clue for the other box to figure out later, and decided to <br/>
get something <br/>
&gt; to eat and call it a day.  I will try again in a few weeks, and <br/>
maybe have <br/>
&gt; some better luck, but I did come home with three new finds, and a <br/>
new idea.<br/>

<br/>
Checking in from Western Kentucky before a meeting.  Either way is <br/>
fine, though I won't be able to do anything until mid-December at the <br/>
earliest.  The Apple Dumpling Gang has repsonded that they are aware <br/>
that Flying Through is missing, but have not said anything as to <br/>
wanting it replaced.<br/>
<br/>
Yep, map in hand ought to save time at Kalmbach.  It is good to see <br/>
the Philly suburbanites make the trip across the foreboding South <br/>
Mountain to explore the verdant Lehigh Valley!<br/>

&gt; You wanna replace Lock Ridge or me?<br/>

&gt; <br/>
&gt; Good Job.  Lock Ridge has been confirmed missing by Raindear, the <br/>
&gt; Jedi Master and myself.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; When I get back in town, I'll need to check on Reimert.  You need <br/>
to <br/>
&gt; take the right hand split of the white trail.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; It was also good to hear about Rodale being OK.  Indigo Vulture had <br/>
&gt; reported on that one being in a swamped area.  It also seems like <br/>
&gt; they fixed the bridge he described as being out at Kalmbach.<br/>

&gt; &gt; So, anyways, you folks have already heard about the Hairy Leggers <br/>
&gt; adventures <br/>
&gt; &gt; at Blue Marsh, where we snagged not only the two stamps from <br/>
Stamp <br/>
&gt; Collection <br/>
&gt; &gt; that are there, but also were the first finders on Like Chasing <br/>
&gt; Rainbows, <br/>
&gt; &gt; after it has been sitting there for a year and a half.  Not a bad <br/>
&gt; day, too bad my <br/>
&gt; &gt; Sunday did not go as well.<br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; I slept a little later then I had wanted to on Sunday (usually I <br/>
am <br/>
&gt; working), <br/>
&gt; &gt; and didn't get up to the Lehigh Valley until almost noon.  This <br/>
was <br/>
&gt; not <br/>
&gt; &gt; totally a bad thing, since it was raining in the morning.  Of <br/>
&gt; course the rain was a <br/>
&gt; &gt; bad thing, because everything was very wet that afternoon.<br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; First up was Da Pokemon Code.  First finder, a very easy box once <br/>
&gt; you figure <br/>
&gt; &gt; out the clue.<br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; Next I set out to find the Rodale Fitness Park.  This is where <br/>
&gt; thing got a <br/>
&gt; &gt; little, OK, a lot wet.  I got to the boardwalk in the clues when <br/>
I <br/>
&gt; found that <br/>
&gt; &gt; the stream running beneath it had actually flooded over and torn <br/>
a <br/>
&gt; three foot <br/>
&gt; &gt; section of it clear out.  I would have jumped this section (OK, I <br/>
&gt; am not real <br/>
&gt; &gt; athletic, but I am not that bad), but the wet boardwalk was as <br/>
&gt; slick as ice, so <br/>
&gt; &gt; I worked my way though the woods, getting even wetter, back to <br/>
the <br/>
&gt; front of <br/>
&gt; &gt; the park, and finally worked my way to the other side of the <br/>
trail, <br/>
&gt; finding the <br/>
&gt; &gt; box which had somehow been saved from the deluge.<br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; Next up was Lock Ridge.  After slogging though yet more water <br/>
(did <br/>
&gt; I mention <br/>
&gt; &gt; it rained), I was disappointed to find no box.<br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; Just down the road, I headed into Kalmbach Park, and easily found <br/>
&gt; the box <br/>
&gt; &gt; hidden there, and didn't get too wet either.<br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; My next, and as it would turn out, final stop, was the Reimert <br/>
Bird <br/>
&gt; Haven.  I <br/>
&gt; &gt; hiked up, and up, and up the hill on the trail, but could not <br/>
seem <br/>
&gt; to find <br/>
&gt; &gt; the Wildlands box.  I kicked around for about an hour, but I just <br/>
&gt; don't think I <br/>
&gt; &gt; could come up with the correct location.  So I headed back down <br/>
and <br/>
&gt; copied <br/>
&gt; &gt; down the clue for the other box to figure out later, and decided <br/>
to <br/>
&gt; get something <br/>
&gt; &gt; to eat and call it a day.  I will try again in a few weeks, and <br/>
&gt; maybe have <br/>
&gt; &gt; some better luck, but I did come home with three new finds, and a <br/>
&gt; new idea.<br/>
