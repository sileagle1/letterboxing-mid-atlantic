Say a letterboxer plants a box and later comes down with irreversible<br/>
amnesia. Hence, they cannot remember planting the box or anything<br/>
about letterboxing. Oh, and in the incident, lose their logbook.<br/>
<br/>
A couple months later, they read a Time article or catch something on<br/>
CNN and realize, "Hey that's a cool hobby". They hop on LBNA, then<br/>
locate and find a letterbox really close to where they live.<br/>
<br/>
As it turns out, they find the same letterbox that they planted...<br/>
<br/>
Does this count as a find?<br/>
<br/>
I had hoped to stir up the main list a bit, but there were few <br/>
nibbles.<br/>

the box, it might be the letterbox type, clue or location which draw <br/>
the amnesiac to search for this prise, never realizing that the <br/>
things which cause them to seek the box are the thing(s) which may <br/>
have prompted them to plant such a box in the first place. If a <br/>
person repeatedly, accidently, happens upon the box which they <br/>
themselves have planted (Oh my. What's this?) it is still indeed a <br/>
valid find. If that person has a short term memory loss and hour to <br/>
hour or day to day has no recollection of finding the letterbox a <br/>
second, third, fourth time (we must at this point assume that the <br/>
person in question carries papers or index cards on which to stamp <br/>
and not a book, as said person might recognize a duplicate stamp) <br/>
then yes, that counts as a find. This is not my opinion. This is one <br/>
of the laws of the universe. I didn't write the laws, I only obey <br/>
them.<br/>
