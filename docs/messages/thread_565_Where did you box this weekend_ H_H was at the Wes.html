Western NY gathering I am back home in good ol' PA.<br/>
Friday after my daily grind I jumped a couple of<br/>
trains up to NYC and crashed out at Miss Moon's.<br/>
Saturday way-too-early she and I drove up through some<br/>
beautiful country and arrived at the gathering about<br/>
3:00PM. We met some great folks! It was wonderful to<br/>
put some faces to some of the names I've seen on the<br/>
various talk lists. Lemme tell you LBMA-ers, this was<br/>
an OUTDOOR gathering. These hardy folks had been out<br/>
in some serious cold since about 10:00 AM, exchanging<br/>
and boxing all day long. Sprite posted last night that<br/>
she couldn't get the smile off her face, that's cause<br/>
it's frozen in place! Anyway, great time, great<br/>
people, beautiful day. Several of us went out to<br/>
dinner which just extended the fun even more. Sunday<br/>
AM Miss Moon and I found a box right near our motel<br/>
then boogied about a hour north to Niagra Falls. Both<br/>
of us had never been there before so it was a real<br/>
treat. We walked around in Canada for awhile and then<br/>
found the Elba Onions "Goat Island" box before sadly<br/>
heading south again. But, thanks to the Northwoods<br/>
Adventure Team we rocked out to a live String Cheese<br/>
Incident show taped at the Fillmore, thanks SO MUCH<br/>
for the music guys! What a great way to spend a sunny<br/>
November day driving through your beautiful state. <br/>
<br/>
I really enjoyed meeting everyone, their friendliness<br/>
and hospitality made the whirlwind trip a blast.<br/>
Thanks to Sprite and the Highlander and all who helped<br/>
put the gathering together. Also, special thanks to<br/>
Sprite who ran clues over to our motel room so we<br/>
could box on Sunday. And lastly, thanks to my<br/>
travelling partner, Miss Moon. It was fun travling<br/>
with someone other than Dude the Wonder Dog. Dude's<br/>
great but he's not enough of a conversationalist to<br/>
sustain a 7 hour drive. Thanks again!<br/>
<br/>
I don't keep close track on my progress because a. I<br/>
am too lazy to count b. Only have 10 fingers and ten<br/>
toes and am easily confused by numbers over 20 c. Am<br/>
not particularly competitive. That being said during<br/>
our 7 hour drive home I did some counting and it seems<br/>
that I am at P27, F94, X97, HH10, PLB's 4. This<br/>
weekend Mr.Irene and I will be in Dewey Beach DE and<br/>
will be hunting Mz Scarlet's boxes so I am pretty sure<br/>
I'll pass F100. I've only been boxing since the end of<br/>
January of this year so I am pretty pleased with my<br/>
progress, especially since when I first started I<br/>
hunted twice as many as I found! <br/>
<br/>
Thanks to all who make this hobby so much fun. Carmen,<br/>
Deb, Dude, Jasmine, Cody and I are having way too much<br/>
fun!<br/>
