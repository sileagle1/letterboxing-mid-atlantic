Originally, I was planning on having Noxers do the judging.  But as<br/>
most of them will miss <br/>
the nuance of the delightfully turned phrase, I may need to come up<br/>
with another plan.<br/>
Most of them just stop and giggle like 12 year-old boys when they<br/>
read about Poison Ivy's <br/>
"P-ness."<br/>
Speaking of Poison Ivy, I may just present a Lifetime Achievement<br/>
Haiku-er of the <br/>
Millenium Award originally planned for Michael Jackson.  We have had<br/>
American Poet <br/>
Laureates with less breadth and depth to their work.  Bravo P I<br/>
