recently i posted an Access Database on this newsgroup; also cross <br/>
posting the file to "Letterbox USA". to date i have received a lot of <br/>
feedback from the national group but have not heard anything from the <br/>
Mid-Atlantic group. of course my allegiance is to the Lbma and was <br/>
wondering if any of my homeboys and sista's are using it.<br/>

Worked a gazillion hours last 3 weeks on a big honkin'<br/>
project, went to a gathering this past w/e and have a<br/>
romantic getaway planned w/Mr. Irene this coming<br/>
weekend. But I liked what I saw alot! I think any<br/>
input you got from your beta testers should be good<br/>
enough to move ahead with. I will probably wait until<br/>
things slow down a little to start entering my data.<br/>
But great job and thanks so much for sharing it with<br/>
your homies....<br/>
