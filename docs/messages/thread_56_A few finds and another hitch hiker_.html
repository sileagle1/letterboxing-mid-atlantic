<div><font face="Arial" family="SANSSERIF" size="2">Did a little hiking the past two days and am happy to report I have found three boxes and a hitch hiker to boot!</font></div>
<div><font face="Arial" family="SANSSERIF" size="2"></font> </div>
<div><font face="Arial" family="SANSSERIF" size="2">First, on Friday, I found the first two parts of the Stamp Collection outside of Reading, PA.  They were easy to find, but very long, hard hikes for me.  It is good though, I need to get back in shape ;)  Both boxes were in fine condition, and this was their first visit since November (The Raindears).</font></div>
<div><font face="Arial" family="SANSSERIF" size="2"></font> </div>
<div><font face="Arial" family="SANSSERIF" size="2">With the second box I found the HH Sputnik.  Neat stamp, but it was in pretty bad shape, and the log was toasted.  I am going to hold on to it for a bit and replace the logbook, clean up the stamp, and give it a new container before sending it on its way.</font></div>
<div><font face="Arial" family="SANSSERIF" size="2"></font> </div>
<div><font face="Arial" family="SANSSERIF" size="2">Finally, I found My Alma Mater - DVC with easy.  Interestingly, security at the college knows about the box and just about every guard there has logged into it using its own stamp, as well as one of the directors there.  Pretty funny.<br/><br/>Cyclonic<br/>Nathan Brown<br/>***************************************************<br/> "Oh good, my dog found the chainsaw!"<br/>P1 F20+3HH</font></div></html></div>
