be contacting the placers with specifics. We hit our<br/>
100th box on Miz Scarlet's Red Mill Pond and almost<br/>
had the cops called on us! It was in a development but<br/>
in a really cool place. We parked and found the<br/>

a resident walked up to the window and asked us if we<br/>
needed help. We said no, we were reading our maps<br/>
before we headed home. Which really made no sense<br/>
because it was deep into this development, not<br/>
anywhere where you would pull in to read a map. But it<br/>
was the best we could come up with. Well, he must have<br/>
called the guy who owned the house next door to the<br/>
lot where the box was because as I got out of the van<br/>

okay'ed us bringing the box home and mailing to her.<br/>
It was that or explain ourselves to the cops which I<br/>
am sure were the next people we'd see! <br/>

Congrats on F100!<br/>
You are much better at this sport than you give yourself credit for.<br/>
To reach 100 in &lt; 12 months is quite an achievement, especially if you<br/>
don't live in CN.<br/>
<br/>
I managed a get away weekend with my wife to Charlottesville, VA.<br/>
Planted one box on Skyline Drive.<br/>
Shenandoah National Park is a real beauty of a park.<br/>
But man did we hit fog!<br/>
Clues will be posted soon.<br/>
<br/>
Managed after some effort to find the only box in Charlottesville:<br/>
Vietnam Memorial.  <br/>
Saw Monticello and several other local sites.  Ate some great food.<br/>
Drove 675 miles.<br/>
Nice weekend.<br/>
<br/>
Jan,<br/>
Hope all is well at your home.<br/>

&gt;  We hit our<br/>
&gt; &gt; 100th box on Miz Scarlet's Red Mill Pond and<br/>
&gt; almost<br/>
&gt; &gt; had the cops called on us! It was in a development<br/>
&gt; &gt; but<br/>
&gt; &gt; in a really cool place. We parked and found the<br/>
&gt; &gt; box,took it back to our van and were stamping in<br/>
&gt; &gt; when<br/>
&gt; &gt; a resident walked up to the window and asked us if<br/>
&gt; &gt; we<br/>
&gt; &gt; needed help. We said no, we were reading our maps<br/>
&gt; &gt; before we headed home. Which really made no sense<br/>
&gt; &gt; because it was deep into this development, not<br/>
&gt; &gt; anywhere where you would pull in to read a map.<br/>
&gt; But<br/>
&gt; &gt; it<br/>
&gt; &gt; was the best we could come up with. Well, he must<br/>
&gt; &gt; have<br/>
&gt; &gt; called the guy who owned the house next door to<br/>
&gt; the<br/>
&gt; &gt; lot where the box was because as I got out of the<br/>
&gt; &gt; van<br/>
&gt; &gt; to re-hide, I noticed the homeowner standing in<br/>
&gt; the<br/>
&gt; &gt; driveway watching me. So I called Miz Scarlet and<br/>
&gt; &gt; she<br/>
&gt; &gt; okay'ed us bringing the box home and mailing to<br/>
&gt; her.<br/>
&gt; &gt; It was that or explain ourselves to the cops which<br/>
&gt; I<br/>
&gt; &gt; am sure were the next people we'd see! <br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; Anyway, great time. Glad Jan's daughter is going<br/>
&gt; to<br/>
&gt; &gt; be<br/>
&gt; &gt; okay. <br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; Oh, saw National Treasure, really liked it. Harris<br/>
&gt; &gt; LOVED it. Take care all,<br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>

HnH,<br/>
Congrats on F100!<br/>
You are much better at this sport than you give yourself credit for.<br/>
To reach 100 in &lt; 12 months is quite an achievement, especially if you<br/>
don't live in CN.<br/>
<br/>
I managed a get away weekend with my wife to Charlottesville, VA.<br/>
Planted one box on Skyline Drive.<br/>
Shenandoah National Park is a real beauty of a park.<br/>
But man did we hit fog!<br/>
Clues will be posted soon.<br/>
<br/>
Managed after some effort to find the only box in Charlottesville:<br/>
Vietnam Memorial.  <br/>
Saw Monticello and several other local sites.  Ate some great food.<br/>
Drove 675 miles.<br/>
Nice weekend.<br/>
<br/>
Jan,<br/>
Hope all is well at your home.<br/>

Well, who'da thunk it? Hikers and Hounds found 100<br/>
boxes in a little more than 10 months. The fact that<br/>
we have probably hunted 200 means nothing! Nah, we've<br/>
really only not found 6, so not too shabby. Dude the<br/>
Wonder Dog is not talking to me but I promised him<br/>
some boxing over Thanksgiving weekend.  Mr. Irene and<br/>
I had a WONDERFUL time at the Delaware beaches. We've<br/>
been going there since we met 9 years ago (he used to<br/>
live in Greenville, DE) but never really visited Lewes<br/>
beofre. What an absolutely charming little town. We<br/>
found boxes hidden by Mix Scarlet, Hexacat, Firefly,<br/>
Jessica and Daphnesfam. They were all great and I'll<br/>
be contacting the placers with specifics. We hit our<br/>
100th box on Miz Scarlet's Red Mill Pond and almost<br/>
had the cops called on us! It was in a development but<br/>
in a really cool place. We parked and found the<br/>
box,took it back to our van and were stamping in when<br/>
a resident walked up to the window and asked us if we<br/>
needed help. We said no, we were reading our maps<br/>
before we headed home. Which really made no sense<br/>
because it was deep into this development, not<br/>
anywhere where you would pull in to read a map. But it<br/>
was the best we could come up with. Well, he must have<br/>
called the guy who owned the house next door to the<br/>
lot where the box was because as I got out of the van<br/>
to re-hide, I noticed the homeowner standing in the<br/>
driveway watching me. So I called Miz Scarlet and she<br/>
okay'ed us bringing the box home and mailing to her.<br/>
It was that or explain ourselves to the cops which I<br/>
am sure were the next people we'd see! <br/>
<br/>
Anyway, great time. Glad Jan's daughter is going to be<br/>
okay. <br/>
<br/>
Oh, saw National Treasure, really liked it. Harris<br/>
LOVED it. Take care all,<br/>
<br/>

The one my 8 year old daughter found pretty much by herself?<br/>
I don't know, either the box moved due to an earthquake or the clues<br/>
became obsolete with the passage of time.<br/>
<br/>
It was a bit of a hike, but not that hard to find.<br/>
Something must have changed.<br/>

Next time you are in Newtown, let me know.<br/>
I'll lead an expedition to recover this now infamous treasure.<br/>

&gt; <br/>
&gt; It was a bit of a hike, but not that hard to find.<br/>

We've<br/>&gt; been going there since we met 9 years ago (he used<br/>&gt; 
to<br/>&gt; live in Greenville, DE) but never really visited<br/>&gt; 
Lewes<br/>&gt; beofre. What an absolutely charming little town. We<br/>&gt; found 
boxes hidden by Mix Scarlet, Hexacat, Firefly,<br/>&gt; Jessica and Daphnesfam. 
They were all great and I'll<br/>&gt; be contacting the placers with specifics. 
We hit our<br/>&gt; 100th box on Miz Scarlet's Red Mill Pond and almost<br/>&gt; 
had the cops called on us! It was in a development<br/>&gt; but<br/>&gt; in a 
really cool place. We parked and found the<br/>&gt; box,took it back to our van 
and were stamping in<br/>&gt; when<br/>&gt; a resident walked up to the window and 
asked us if<br/>&gt; we<br/>&gt; needed help. We said no, we were reading our 
maps<br/>&gt; before we headed home. Which really made no sense<br/>&gt; because 
it was deep into this development, not<br/>&gt; anywhere where you would pull in 
to read a map. But<br/>&gt; it<br/>&gt; was the best we could come up with. Well, 
he must<br/>&gt; have<br/>&gt; called the guy who owned the house next door to 
the<br/>&gt; lot where the box was because as I got out of the<br/>&gt; 
van<br/>&gt; to re-hide, I noticed the homeowner standing in the<br/>&gt; driveway 
watching me. So I called Miz Scarlet and<br/>&gt; she<br/>&gt; okay'ed us bringing 
the box home and mailing to her.<br/>&gt; It was that or explain ourselves to the 
cops which I<br/>&gt; am sure were the next people we'd see! <br/>&gt; <br/>&gt; 
Anyway, great time. Glad Jan's daughter is going to<br/>&gt; be<br/>&gt; okay. 
<br/>&gt; <br/>&gt; Oh, saw National Treasure, really liked it. Harris<br/>&gt; 
LOVED it. Take care all,<br/>&gt; <br/>&gt; Irene - H&amp;H<br/>&gt; <br/>&gt;

But I was thinking that a mini gathering in Tyler State Park might make<br/>
sense.  There is a really great fire ring down by the water that we<br/>
might be able to get access to.<br/>
We could branch out from there to seek the BoB boxes.<br/>
<br/>
I'm trying to get a group of my Adventure Guides together this weekend<br/>
to go fossil hunting at Swatara park (near Lebanon, PA).  I have 4<br/>
stamps carved in honor of this spot.  They've been I my trunk for<br/>
months.<br/>
Anyway, if I pull that event off, I doubt I can make another trip to<br/>
Newtown this same weekend.<br/>
<br/>
Anybody have any info on renting that fire pit at Tyler Park?<br/>

Please let me know when this expedition takes place too.  After two<br/>
laborious attempts to find it, once with Irene and once alone, I think<br/>
I deserve a break too!<br/>

&gt; Well if you, Cuclonic and Ryan couldn't find it I<br/>
&gt; doubt if I will. but I'll probably give it another go<br/>
&gt; or two...<br/>
