So, I want to finish two series I am working on, Ben<br/>

the Battle of the Band boxes. And then there's that<br/>
darn Schofiled Ford Covered Bridge which continues to<br/>
taunt me. PLUS, Hungry Termites are moving on and I<br/>
hear that box totally rocks. So, 2 days, how do I<br/>
prioritize? Dude the Wonder Dog and I will have a chat<br/>
and come up with a game plan for Saturday and Sunday.<br/>
But I'm thinking at least one day will be spent at<br/>
Tyler. Tim, which day works better for you, If you do<br/>
