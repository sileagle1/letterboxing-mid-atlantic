It's probably my favorite of M. Night's, that and<br/>
Signs. Having raised 3 boys (two of my own and one<br/>
step son) I was surrounded by comic books. I knew all<br/>
the characters and was/is a huge X-Men fan. I loved<br/>
the themes in Unbreakable and thought it was so well<br/>
done. Every movie doesn't have to have an explosion<br/>
every 10 minutes or move at breakneck speed. So was I<br/>
right, is that Franklin Feild there across from U of P<br/>
hospital? Hey, what did you do on the film? I was<br/>
working at 18th &amp; Market when they were making it and<br/>
did go to a couple of location shoots and got to watch<br/>
Samuel Jackson walking down a street. My brief brush<br/>
with fame! That and the time I was training for Pfizer<br/>
on a project in Century City, Los Angeles and the<br/>
post-awards ball for the Emmys was in our hotel. Got<br/>
to meet a lot of Celebs then. So give details, what<br/>
did you did and how did it come about?<br/>

&gt; &gt; &gt; Good.  That gives me some time to get it down<br/>

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Aren't you sweet!  Actually, we just found out<br/>
&gt; a<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; few hours ago that<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; the surgery won't be until Monday now.  We<br/>
&gt; were<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; hoping to have it done<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; over the holidays while everyone was off work<br/>
&gt; but<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; the swelling is<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; still too bad to think about surgery.  So it<br/>
&gt; looks<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; as though I will be<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; going down Monday after work to visit her and<br/>
&gt; to<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; reassure myself that<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; my baby is ok and possibly again Tuesday after<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; work and hopefully she<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; will come home on Wednesday.<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; On the positive side, I should have some free<br/>
&gt; time<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; to letterbox closer<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; to home this weekend!<br/>
