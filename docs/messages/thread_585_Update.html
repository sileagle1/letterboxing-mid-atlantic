Warcat's Holiday series it was off to do some repair work on our boxes.  <br/>
<br/>
Boy Scout Area Waterfalls - The clues have been updated to avoid some<br/>
confusion that there has been and the missing stamp has been replaced<br/>
<br/>
Gabriella's Flag - The missing stamp has been replaced<br/>
<br/>
In addition we added ink pads to both boxes.<br/>
<br/>
Happy Hunting<br/>

May Day Lillies<br/>

<br/>
P.S. We also planted a new letterbox today...stay tuned for the clues<br/>
in the near future...just think...ICE CREAM</div>
