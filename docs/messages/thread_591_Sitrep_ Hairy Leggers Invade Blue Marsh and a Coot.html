<br/>
The Hairy Legged Boxers are happy to report on our boxing mischief at <br/>
Blue Marsh Lake....<br/>
<br/>
Found:  NW and NE of the "Stamp Collection" Series.  NW was in good <br/>
shape, NE had been gotten to by a beast of some sort.  The box was <br/>
wrecked, soaked and chewed upon.  We need to email ShredMTB.<br/>
<br/>
We also found "Like Chasing Rainbows", a box that eluded us in our <br/>
last adventure.  Some nerdology helped here.  Finally, we revisited <br/>
the scene of "Mobius Strip" to see if any new finds have occurred.<br/>
<br/>
Hidden was Mothra and Little Alien's Older Brother, which will be <br/>
normal boxes, in an area laden with mystery.<br/>
<br/>
Cooties also showed their ugly faces by some Killer Peas first <br/>
infesting Jan from Reading and then being transferred to Cichlid Guy <br/>
by our intrepid 10 yr old.  I was also violated by receiving a slug <br/>
like cootie myself.<br/>
<br/>
Our intrepid travelers included Cyclonic, Jan from reading, Cichlid <br/>
Guy (for the Mobius) and Thomas and Lightnin' Bug of Team Lightnin' <br/>
Bug.<br/>
<br/>
Happy Trails,<br/>
<br/>

pretty proud of Tom, who did the 6+ mile jaunt with only complaints <br/>
on uphills.<br/>
<br/>
We were stoked and displaying our hairy legs about being the only <br/>
finders of Like Chasing Rainbows, a box that took multiple visits to <br/>
finally suss.  Nathan celebrated by planying a HH from our favorite <br/>
hostel raider!<br/>
<br/>
ShredMTB is to be commended on a challenging bunch of published <br/>
boxes, and he has responded to our report of NW of the Stamp <br/>
Collection series being badly damaged.<br/>
<br/>
Plus there are 2 new boxes in the 'hood for those who like normal <br/>
clues.<br/>
