Guess who gets an all expenses paid week in Calvert City, Kentucky?  <br/>
(Hint - It's chemical plant heaven near Paducah).<br/>
<br/>
Your friendly neighborhood luminescent insect.  I leave for Nashville <br/>
tomorrow, so I hope to snag a few boxes there and along the way, <br/>
weather permitting.  There is actually an indoor box in Guthrie, KY.<br/>
<br/>
Western KY has a grand total of 3 boxes, surely more will be there <br/>
once I've carved and planted.  There is a wonderful area called Land <br/>
between the Lakes nearby (my hotel will overlook one of these lakes) <br/>
and I am looking forward to boxing a smidge during my downtime.<br/>
<br/>
I will be returning to eastern PA on Dec 7th, hopefully a little <br/>
higher in my PFX count....<br/>

<br/>
I know I've been quiet lately, so I thought I'd give you an update. Two <br/>
weeks ago, Jennifer and I took a 6-day trip to Seattle, where we were the <br/>
surprise guests at a "mystery guest gathering" and were also able to go <br/>
letterboxing with Ryan, Amanda from Seattle and Funhog. Jennifer found 60 <br/>
or so boxes on the trip; I found a few less since I had a conference to <br/>
attend, but still was able to pass F600 on the trip. It was a fun trip, and <br/>
the weather was mostly cooperative (i.e., the rain was never too severe to <br/>
interfere with our boxing).<br/>
<br/>
Once we got back from WA, I had to turn around and fly up to Boston and <br/>
back, and then I began my Thanksgiving travels. And both of us have been <br/>
battling the flu off and on for what seems like weeks, which has slowed us <br/>
down a bit, too.<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, I'm otherwise engaged on the date of the road rally in January <br/>
(just like I was for Plantapalooza) -- sorry!<br/>
<br/>
I also saw National Treasure, and it was really a lot of fun -- I highly <br/>
recommend it. (The movie does play fast and loose with historical "facts," <br/>
but I did just discover by accident one really big discrepancy regarding <br/>
the scene at Independence Hall that would have made that particular <br/>
sequence impossible -- anyone care to guess what it is? Without giving away <br/>
too much to anyone who hasn't already seen it, of course!)<br/>
<br/>
Hope you all had a good Thanksgiving!<br/>

I saw it too.  <br/>
Good show, but my wife and I agreed, not quite as good as Indiana Jones.<br/>
<br/>
The whole idea of the shadow from the Independence Hall seemed a bit of<br/>
a     stretch to me.  Doesn't matter what day of the year it was?<br/>
Of course, the Liberty Bell has moved since the filming too, right?<br/>
<br/>
Welcome back, by the way.<br/>

<div>We in Washington, DC enjoy watching Hollywood play fast and loose with the geography.  Was that a Baltimore subway train going by or San Fran or a set?  They don't let you film in the DC Metro so you seldom see the distinctive DC Metro cars in the movies.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>I am now waiting to hear a new letterboxer say, "Learned about it from the National Treasuire website."</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Naturally I am trying to figure out a couple of boxes to make to go along with the movie.  So many stamp ideas, so little time.  </div>

Yes, where the shadow falls at a specific time will differ from season to <br/>
season and day to day, but there's a more important architectural problem <br/>
that also gets in the way....<br/>

<div>We in Washington, DC enjoy watching Hollywood play fast and loose with the geography.  Was that a Baltimore subway train going by or San Fran or a set?  They don't let you film in the DC Metro so you seldom see the distinctive DC Metro cars in the movies.</div>

<div>I am now waiting to hear a new letterboxer say, "Learned about it from the National Treasuire website."</div>

<div>Naturally I am trying to figure out a couple of boxes to make to go along with the movie.  So many stamp ideas, so little time.  </div>
