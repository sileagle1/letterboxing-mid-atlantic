<br/>
I just joined this group this morning, (thank you Irene from H &amp; H).  <br/>
I live in Philadelphia and travel alot.  I read about letterboxing <br/>
yesterday in a post on the South Jersey Ghosttowns message board, and <br/>
was so intrigued I ran out and made my stamp last night.  I am going <br/>
out today to find my first letterbox which is not too far from home <br/>
for me.  <br/>
<br/>
I am looking forward to combining my love of travel and photography <br/>
with letterboxing.</div>

</span></blockquote>Yep, and they have letterboxes, too.<br/>
The quick history - the sandy soil and the acidic water from the <br/>
pine needles somehow combine to get iron, and it settles to the <br/>
bottom of the bogs; thus, "bog iron." Refining the iron, using <br/>
charcoal from the pine trees and shells from the nearby bay/sea was <br/>
a big industry from colonial time through mid 1800's all over South <br/>
Jersey. Then hard coal and purer iron were found in PA, the bog iron <br/>
couldn't compete and poof! no industry. Glass and paper worked for a <br/>
while, but just for a while. People left, fires went through (they <br/>
always do) and now there's nothing but cellar holes where there were <br/>
full-blown towns complete with gas lit streets.<br/>
Great boxing territory.<br/>

all for being such a welcoming group.  The board is very active, and <br/>
everyone seems to be quite enthusiastic about the hobby.  Someone <br/>
asked if my trail name was my address, actually my trail name is <br/>
somecomic, close but not the same as the address.<br/>
<br/>
yes there are ghost towns in NJ, NJ is filled with wonderful reasons <br/>
to go out and explore.<br/>
<br/>
OK, the hunt...   I went after the 3 boxes in the Pennypack park <br/>
series by Joseph.  I could not find the first 2 and was more than a <br/>
little discouraged as I am an immediate gratification kind of guy...  <br/>
I was able to find the third one one, and wow... What a neat feeling <br/>
of excitement and being connected to others when I saw the other <br/>
stamps in his book.  This is an enjoyable hike if you haven't taken <br/>
it yet.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for welcoming me, hope to meet some of you sometime.<br/>
