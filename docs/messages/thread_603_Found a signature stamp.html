                    <div id="ygrps-yiv-72319964">While boxing at Nockamixon Lake on November 27th I found someone's <br/>
signature stamp in the first of the LoTR Series- Minas Tirith box.  <br/>
The stamp is of animal tracks, carved on an eraser that was bought at <br/>
A.C Moore.  It looks like it was stamped in hot pink, and the owner <br/>
stamped into Minas Tirith and the Cabin by the Lake boxes in early <br/>
November.  Unfortunatly the owner did not sign a trail name.  <br/>
<br/>
If anybody knows who this stamp belongs to please e-mail me off list, <br/>
so we can make arrangements to get this stamp back to the proper <br/>
person.<br/>
