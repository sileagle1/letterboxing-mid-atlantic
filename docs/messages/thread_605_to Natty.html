                    <div id="ygrps-yiv-296807427">First, I want to say I don't ask for clues.  I'm not a hiker.  I like finding boxes.  So if I get a <br/>
clue on a box, it kinda ruins it for me.  I'm one of those weird people who throw out the <br/>
crossword puzzle if someone else chimes in with 11 Down.<br/>
<br/>
So I was not asking Mapsurfer for help on his box. Don't want it.  Can't use it. On the other <br/>
hand, I believe I have pretty much determined that the box is MIA.  And I think we should <br/>
all police our MIA boxes if we can.<br/>
<br/>
Hey, I don't want to make this an indictment of the guy.  For all I know he could be out <br/>
Orienteering Outer Mongolia and away from email.  I am also sure that many people have <br/>
real lives.  Although I can't understand why.<br/>
<br/>
In a weird way, I thought maybe a little public discussion might encourage him to <br/>
comment.  I mean, I know where he lives and I just don't want to find myself sitting in his <br/>
driveway at 2am.  I thought that part of my life was over.  10 or 11 restraining orders and <br/>
you kinda get the message, if you know what I mean.<br/>

Ugh...<br/><br/>I would, on rare occassion in the early days, get a<br/>nice little email in response to emailing him that I<br/>had found some elusive treasure he knew I was looking<br/>for.  I think, though, at this point, the emails have<br/>become too much and that's cool, too.<br/><br/>In short- don't ask for clues, you won't get any, and<br/>so you won't be disappointed. <br/><br/>In a way, I like that, because when I've finally found<br/>'that' box boy is it ultra sweet!  There's nothing<br/>more fullfilling in this game than to hear people say<br/>something's missing and you know you are possibly the<br/>only one, or one of very few, who have found it.  <br/><br/>Happy Boxing!</font></blockquote></span></blockquote></div>
