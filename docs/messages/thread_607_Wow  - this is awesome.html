I have read her occasional posts and she doesn't seem at all the person who enjoys or encourages personal attacks. In fact, I have seen her actually apologize on the big list for her husbands behavior. So Brian, Kevin, Linseed Oil and whatever other ID's you use, you're in the wrong place. This board is full of fun loving, mature adults who support each others efforts, allow any question to be asked and answered, encourage differing opinions and enjoy some playful kidding without malice. Just the kind of place you would hate and not at all the place you describe below. In fact, I don't think any of the boards who would encourage or tolerate your sort of behavior. Why don't you creat your own talk list under your own ID and see if anyone else joins? Might be an educational experience for you.</div>
