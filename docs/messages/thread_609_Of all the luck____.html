                    <div id="ygrps-yiv-677764417">Sounds like our life.  I've tried 5 different times to look for this one <br/>
box.  I'm only in that part of Maryland once a month to attend a <br/>
knitting group.   Sept. and Oct.:  car in garage and missed meeting, <br/>
Nov.: too rainy, Dec.:  too cold and windy.  Yesterday my son had an dr. <br/>
appt. at Children's in DC.  We were near this box again.  Too rainy.  <br/>
Last year he had an appt. at Children's every 3 weeks but we weren't <br/>
boxing then.  I know you can box in the rain but I don't want to take a <br/>
chance on any log books getting damp.<br/>
<br/>
But we redeemed ourselves today.  The weather was really nice so we went <br/>
to a park with 6 boxes.  Found them all.  My son finally decided to help <br/>
do the stamping in his log book.  So that went quicker.  This was our <br/>
largest one day find.  That brings us up to 22 finds!!<br/>
