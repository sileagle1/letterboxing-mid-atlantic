I mis-understood your post and reacted out of that misunderstanding. In retrospect I believe your post was a reaction to message #3107 in which I did state that Kevin Onassis was Brian. Honestly, that was divulged on the main list months ago after the Kevin Onassis post as a supposed newbie keeping the stamps he found. Someone said to those of us who believed the post was real "relax, it's only Brian of TGD having some fun". And yes, I did say some other unkind things in my post. I had no idea you folks were lurkers on this list. That being said, I am not the only one on this list who are upset or angered or appalled by some of the things that happen on the main list and we often discuss them here. Just a heads up. </div>

<div>But I was incredibly rude this morning and do sincerely apologize. Now that we know you are here, welcome. This list is pretty heavy with newbie's from the PA, NJ, DE, NY, VE, DC and other Mid-Atlantic states, so we re-hash a lot of the issues that get us flamed on the main list. We are fortunate to have many expereinced boxers here as well to help us out whenever we need it. It's a good list, full of really great folks. Again, I want to apologize for my behavior. This is not at all how things are done here. Welcome.</div>
