<br/>
We currently have a tie for first, a 3-way tie for second and a 7 way tie for 3rd.<br/>
<br/>
I am waiting on a tie breaker and will announce ASAP.<br/>
<br/>
I am happy to say you have brought great joy to your fellow letterboxers.  All judges have <br/>
expressed how tough the voting was and how much they enjoyed being asked to judge.  <br/>
Unless I hear strong objection, I will also announce the winners on the Big Board.  If only <br/>
to rub it in their face that we are having a fun, creative time while they become further <br/>
mired in *ick-tweaking.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks to everyone who participated.<br/>
<br/>
