<br/>
Some southern boxes to report before I come back home.  I was able to <br/>
Find "Land Between the Lakes" in Western KY, and "Wacinton - <br/>
Chickasaw Indian Tree" in Paducah, KY.  Wacinton would have to rate <br/>
as one of the BEST stamps that I have seen.  I can't wait to show <br/>
y'all!!<br/>
<br/>
Planted the "Kentucky Dam" Letterbox near Gilbertsville, KY.  It's a <br/>
drive by.<br/>
<br/>
Take care,<br/>

St. Louis is about 170 miles from Paducah (Wacinton).  KY Dam is <br/>
another 20-25 miles and Land Between the lakes another 20-25.  Heck, <br/>
you could keep going and hit Nashville in a few hours.  Needless to <br/>
say, things are a bit more spread out in the Heartland.  Your can get <br/>
a one-way rental drop off!<br/>
<br/>
Happy trails,<br/>
