<div>The first of the Goose Creek boxes is MIA.  The 2nd is a rather nice stamp,  You can closer to it by looking at the map and finding the bridge.  </div>
<div> </div>
<div>The 2nd Froggy box, Eyes, may be MIA and 1 and 2 were both tricky to find even when it wasn't.  Nice stamps though.  </div>
<div> </div>
<div>I don't remember any other MIA boxes in that area, at least none that aren't listed as such.  Rich just recently restored his fun boxes in the area so that's a plus.  </div>

<div>Not far from there, in Great Falls, I just planted a new series on Evil Women.  (Plug, plug.)  </div>
<div> </div>
<div>Happy hunting out there,</div>
