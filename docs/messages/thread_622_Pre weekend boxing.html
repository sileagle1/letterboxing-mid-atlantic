appearance.  They are going to the beauty parlor today so they will <br/>
really be glamorous for Christmas. <br/>
<br/>
There are only two B&amp;E boxes in Armentrout now (WW was there but she <br/>
flew off after Hallowe'en).  About two miles down the road in the <br/>
Four Mills Nature Preserve (at 12 Morris Road) B&amp;E placed three <br/>
boxes - this weekend they will be going down to check on them. <br/>
<br/>
Irene, perhaps you and your crew were misled by the conversation <br/>
between B&amp;E at the beginning of their clues.  (We told them not to be <br/>
so tricky!)<br/>

&gt; &gt; No.  It's bad when you wake up during a hurricane and <br/>
think, "Maybe <br/>
&gt; I can squeeze one in <br/>
&gt; &gt; when the eye passes over."<br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; I tried it this summer during Hurricane Charley on the Outer <br/>
Banks.<br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; I don't recommend it.<br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; What's a little rain?  Go for it!<br/>

<div><font face="Arial" family="SANSSERIF" size="2">I have been doing some pre-weekend boxing as well, since the weekend will be taken up by coaster riding :-)</font></div>
<div><font face="Arial" family="SANSSERIF" size="2"></font> </div>
<div><font face="Arial" family="SANSSERIF" size="2">I was in downtown DC today, but I am getting ahead of myself.  I was up by 6 today (that is sleeping in for me), and found the three Suburban Saturday boxes.  Someone beat me to them, but that is OK.  All were in fine shape, though the previous finder did not hide them well, and the third box was clear out in the open, easily seen from the trail.</font></div>
<div><font face="Arial" family="SANSSERIF" size="2"></font> </div>
<div><font face="Arial" family="SANSSERIF" size="2">I hopped on the Metro and headed into town.  The first stop there was Roosevelt Island, where I found Ted E Bear in fine condition.  What a neat spot too, it is a memorial kinda hidden away, but very fitting for Teddy Roosevelt, being in the middle of nature like it is.</font></div>
<div><font face="Arial" family="SANSSERIF" size="2"></font> </div>
<div><font face="Arial" family="SANSSERIF" size="2">I walked across to the Mall (yeah, I had to make a hike out of these urban boxes), and found Orion the Hunter right where it was meant to be.  It is now in need of yet another log, I filled up the last little space left in it.</font></div>
<div><font face="Arial" family="SANSSERIF" size="2"></font> </div>
<div><font face="Arial" family="SANSSERIF" size="2">But, I did strike out on one as well.  After doing touristy things on the Mall all day, I went in search of Cornucopia, with no luck.  The bush it was supposed to be in were nearly bear of leaves, so I suspect it was muggled.</font></div>
<div><font face="Arial" family="SANSSERIF" size="2"></font> </div>
<div><font face="Arial" family="SANSSERIF" size="2">Well, off to TN tomorrow, can't wait.  On Monday I hope to find some of the boxes in the Great Falls area.  Hope everyone has a good weekend.</font></div>

Series #' 4 &amp; 7. Attempted Baldo but I think it is MIA. Teapot was <br/>
wedding dress hunting with one of our daughters so I was free for the <br/>
day, after a 3 hour trip into the city during rush hour. Also spent <br/>
time taking pictures of The Little Red Lighthouse under the GW Bridge. <br/>
A goodwalk and some great spots for a box.<br/>
