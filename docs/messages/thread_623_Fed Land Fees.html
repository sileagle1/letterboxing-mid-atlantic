<div>Just an FYI. I received this info from my caving club, sent it on to Silent Doug who confirmed it's validity and provided the links below. It appears to be a done deal, signed on Monday the 6th. There seems to be some sort of grassroots effort to repeal or revise the bill but for more info you should contact your local legislature. Personally, I don't have a problem paying if the money goes to preserve and protect our lands, although it's quite a lot of money, IMHO. If it's really used that way and not mis-directed. But the fine is just outrageous. My goal here is not to encourage you to fight this bill, but to inform you so that you can plan accordingly as it seems if we want to use federal land, we will have to cough up the fee for the pass. I am neither advocating nor denouncing here, just informing Please see below.</div>

What if I take a car other than my work car (like Harris's van), do I need a sticker for each car? Can I carry some sort of membership card on me? As a family we can cough up $85 and just share a membership. But for us to have to purchase a tag for each car is not an option. And Carmen, Harris and I all spend time on National Park lands. If the three of us are there at once, do we EACH need a membership? I have lot's of questions too...<br/><br/><b><i>fleurdelislb &lt;fleurdelislb@...&gt;</i></b> wrote:

<div>Hey folks,</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Just an FYI. I received this info from my caving club, sent it on to Silent 
Doug who confirmed it's validity and provided the links below. It appears to be 
a done deal, signed on Monday the 6th. There seems to be some sort of grassroots 
effort to repeal or revise the bill but for more info you should contact your 
local legislature. Personally, I don't have a problem paying if the money goes 
to preserve and protect our lands, although it's quite a lot of money, IMHO. If 
it's really used that way and not mis-directed. But the fine is just outrageous. 
My goal here is not to encourage you to fight this bill, but to inform you so 
that you can plan accordingly as it seems if we want to use federal land, we 
will have to cough up the fee for the pass. I am neither advocating 
nor denouncing here, just informing Please see below.</div>
<div> </div>
<div><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">"A rider has recently been added to an 
Omnibus Appropriations bill for<br/>the FY2005 federal budget which will enact a 
fee system for *ANY*<br/>federal land (BLM, National Forest, National Park, 
etc).  Users would<br/>have to purchase an "America the Beautiful" pass at a 
cost of at least<br/>$85 annually.  Possibly more.  This applies to 
hikers, campers,<br/>fishermen, hunters, anyone using federal land as a 
recreational venue. <br/>This does not apply to mining,  forestry, and 
ranching.  Not purchasing<br/>such a pass would result in fines of $5000 
and/or 6 months in jail. <br/>Drivers, owners, and occupants of vehicles not 
displaying a pass will be<br/>presumed guilty of failure to pay and can all be 
charged, without<br/>obligation by the government to prove their guilt.  
This is far in<br/>excess of other such fines including: damaging fragile wetland 
with an<br/>ATV bears a fine of $75."  <br/> <br/>This bill was 
championed by Congressman Ralph Regula of Ohio and several<br/>other Republican 
legislators from eastern states (states notably lacking<br/>in vast tracts of 
federal land) and is universally opposed by western<br/>legislators.  The 
relevant bill numbers are HR 3283 and S 1108.  For<br/>legal wonks, here's 
the text of the bill itself:<br/>   </font><a href="http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/z?c108:HR3283" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><font color="#003399" face="Times New Roman" size="3">http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/z?c108:HR3283</font></a><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">:<br/></font></div>

 Ok so let me get this straight - if I wanted to go take a stroll in<br/>
 Valley Forge park, I'd have to pay $85?!<br/>
<br/>
 That's ridiculous.<br/>

Naw, just enter the park wearing a flannel shirt and carrying a <br/>
chainsaw.<br/>
