<br/>
So, any boxing plans this weekend?<br/>
<br/>
I will be introducing my parents to this hobby on Saturday from like <br/>
12:30 to 3 or so by taking them to Nickamixon to find Featherhead <br/>
(the box formerly known as Hungry Termites) and the couple that the <br/>
high school kids planted that Leafcutter made stamps for.  Tom, of <br/>
course, will be helping Oma and Opa suss out the clues.    Will be in <br/>
the Sterner Road hiking zone.<br/>
<br/>
I've got to carve them a stamp, as they have chosen a name.<br/>

<div>Okay, here are my non-plans as I have promised my family to control my urges until after Christmas as we have way too much to get done at home. Tomorrow morning I am taking a walk for my health in a local park. I work hard all week, over 50 hours, and build up a lot of stress and tension. Add on top of that the stress of preparing for the holidays and well...a walk is certainly in order! Plus, Dude the Wonder Dog needs his exercise. Yes, it happens to be in a park where I have two more letterboxes to find to complete two series, but I just can't help that!</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Sunday AM Mr. Irene and I will be waking up probably hung over in Delaware. We have our annual Commander Cody Caving Club Christmas party, and BOY, do they party. So we always arrange to crash out at a friends. We will be waking up in need of food and gallons of coffee. So we will head to a nearby diner, probably 1st State Diner on Route 896 in Newark. If it happens that a couple of local boxers drop in for exchanges, well, what a surprise! And if one of them asks Mr. Irene and I if we would like to join them I can't be rude! My goodness, the boxes are right there after all! It's not like we had this pre-planned or anything for cryin' out loud!</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Man, I can't wait for the holidays to be over so that I can get back out there and box! </div>
<div> </div>
<div>Have fun y'all!</div>
