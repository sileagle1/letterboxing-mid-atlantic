Germany) and Team J+R of Baltimore, Maryland to slog through the mud <br/>
at Lake Nockamixon to find Featherhead, Cabin by the Lake and <br/>
Halloween Scare.  I was introducing my parents to Letterboxing and we <br/>
had the pleasure of meeting up with some very nice people (J+R) and <br/>
have a nice, if occaisionally wet and muddy, afternoon.<br/>
<br/>
Tom even planted a slug shaped cootie on Team J+R, the one that the <br/>
Cichlid Guy violated us with a couple weeks back.<br/>
