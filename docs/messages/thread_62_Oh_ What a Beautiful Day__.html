<div> </div>
<div>Was today gorgeous or what? After the rain last night and the grey this morning I thought for sure the weather man had it wrong. </div>
<div> </div>
<div>I went to Neshaminy State Park to exchange with Cyclonic and TomCat who were participating in the huge Civil War Re-enactment there. Cyclonic said they were with the 71st PA, dressed as confederates. I should have asked for clarification!! After walking over 1 mile for more than a hour, from camp to camp I thought, Man! not only am I unable to find letterbox<u>es</u>, I can't find letterbox<u>ers</u> either!! They weren't in the Northern Camps, and the Southerners accused me of being a northern spy as I walked through their encampments asking about the 71st Pa. One gentlemen suggested they had all been killed in battle! Finally a genteel southern belle took pity on this crankee yankee and showed me a map of the camp sites and I found them! So in middle of a Civil War style encampment, I exchanged images with two guys dressed in confederate garb, How cool is that!</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Then I hiked out to the river to check on the Treasure Hunt boxes and to find the volunteers who were picking up trash. I ran into a park guard who offered to give me a $450 fine if I didn't immediately put my faithful companion, Dude the Wonder dog, on a leash. Yikes! As much as he hates it, and really doesn't need it, I leashed him up immediately and asked the guard where the Great PA Clean Up folks were. He said they did that yesterday! I told him the date was today but he said they decided to hold it on a Friday. Seriously worried about the turn my luck had taken I ran, leash in hand, to the beach. Box #1 was peeking out of it's hiding place, evidently hadn't been re-hidden very well, and there were a bunch of kids playing right at that very tree. So I decided to hope for the best and return later. Box #2, also visible was still there. As I opened it to check the log (Thanks guys for all the cool images and comments!!) I saw one salutation that caught my
 breath. It was dated 4/34/04 PA DNRC, and signed the Penna. Dept. of Natural Resources &amp; Conservation!!  The box had been found and not very well re-hidden but was not removed or destroyed! I pleasantly surprised and thoroughly relieved. I checked the third and finally the 1st box and all was well, but they were completely exposed. I meant to bring camo to use when I re-hid them but forgot. Will have to do that another day.</div>

<div>Sorry to be so wordy but I felt like sharing. So....how was YOUR day??</div>

that the DNRC let the box stay - great news!<br/>
<br/>
We biked 24 miles today on the Perkiomen Trail to get our final PT <br/>
box, Sunrise. We found a hitchhiker, and along the way let another <br/>
one go :) It truly was a beautiful day! Even got a bit of color on my <br/>
face and shoulders...<br/>
<br/>
Needless to say, I am SORE, but I want to go out and box some more <br/>
tomorrow! Perhaps to Terra-Cotta Tangram.. I've wanted to get over <br/>
there for some time.<br/>

every little tiny incline left me panting. I think I'll stick to my <br/>

<div>Man oh Man,</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Was today gorgeous or what? After the rain last night and the grey this morning I thought for sure the weather man had it wrong. </div>
<div> </div>
<div>I went to Neshaminy State Park to exchange with Cyclonic and TomCat who were participating in the huge Civil War Re-enactment there. Cyclonic said they were with the 71st PA, dressed as confederates. I should have asked for clarification!! After walking over 1 mile for more than a hour, from camp to camp I thought, Man! not only am I unable to find letterbox<u>es</u>, I can't find letterbox<u>ers</u> either!! They weren't in the Northern Camps, and the Southerners accused me of being a northern spy as I walked through their encampments asking about the 71st Pa. One gentlemen suggested they had all been killed in battle! Finally a genteel southern belle took pity on this crankee yankee and showed me a map of the camp sites and I found them! So in middle of a Civil War style encampment, I exchanged images with two guys dressed in confederate garb, How cool is that!</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Then I hiked out to the river to check on the Treasure Hunt boxes and to find the volunteers who were picking up trash. I ran into a park guard who offered to give me a $450 fine if I didn't immediately put my faithful companion, Dude the Wonder dog, on a leash. Yikes! As much as he hates it, and really doesn't need it, I leashed him up immediately and asked the guard where the Great PA Clean Up folks were. He said they did that yesterday! I told him the date was today but he said they decided to hold it on a Friday. Seriously worried about the turn my luck had taken I ran, leash in hand, to the beach. Box #1 was peeking out of it's hiding place, evidently hadn't been re-hidden very well, and there were a bunch of kids playing right at that very tree. So I decided to hope for the best and return later. Box #2, also visible was still there. As I opened it to check the log (Thanks guys for all the cool images and comments!!) I saw one salutation that caught my breath. It was dated 4/34/04 PA DNRC, and signed the Penna. Dept. of Natural Resources &amp; Conservation!!  The box had been found and not very well re-hidden but was not removed or destroyed! I pleasantly surprised and thoroughly relieved. I checked the third and finally the 1st box and all was well, but they were completely exposed. I meant to bring camo to use when I re-hid them but forgot. Will have to do that another day.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Sorry to be so wordy but I felt like sharing. So....how was YOUR day??</div>
