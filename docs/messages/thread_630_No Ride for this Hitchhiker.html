box.  There were two separate hitchhikers in two separate bags with 2 
separate logs.  Both were left by the person who placed this particular 
box.  I was all set to take one and move it along to another box, 
 when I opened the third bag marked Hitchhiker hostel.  There were 
instructions in that bag to only take a hitchhiker if you leave another one, as 
well as it's own permanent hostel stamp.  This hostel was in a BIG 
bag.  Here is where the confusion set in...  Were those instructions 
only for hitchhikers in the Hostel bag, or for all hitchhikers in the 
entire box?  I decided to err on the side of caution being a newbie 
and leave them all.  I did stamp all the hitchhikers in my log book and 
intend on counting them as finds (if that is correct).  I did not stamp the 
hitchhiker logs as I felt by leaving them, I hadn't really passed them along and 
therefore did not qualify to stamp in to them.  </font></span></div>

<div>Back in early Nov. we were checking on our Wonders of Nature boxes (NJ) and 
found a hitchhiker.  We left it there.  It was in its own box- a 
rather large one (band-aid box size).  It was sealed in the outer plastic 
bag with our box. In other words, very obvious. Today we checked on 
our boxes again and the hitchhiker was still there!  Two different 
people had signed into our logbook since then but did not take the 
hitchhiker.  We checked the logbook of the hitchhiker and found that they 
had not signed into it either.  The boxers' signature stamps were not 
familiar so perhaps they are new, but I would have at least thought they would 
have stamped into the hitchhiker's logbook even if they didn't know they were 
supposed to take it.  Has anyone else had this happen?  Maybe we 
should have moved the hitchhiker on ourselves, but since we won't be boxing 
until the 23rd, we decided to leave it for now.</div>
