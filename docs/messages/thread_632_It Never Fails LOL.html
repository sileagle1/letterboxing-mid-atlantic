<div><font size="2">Ok, so this afternoon I go to check on my box in lower Manhattan. Walk toward the area and it looks like there is NO ONE around..................cool...............ok......I walk closer and see that there are two teenage girls sitting RIGHT there, a few feet from where the box is............not a freaking soul anywhere else even close. LOLOL So I begin a fake call on my cell phone, the wheels in my brain whirring..............damn, damn.............it NEVER fails............what to do...........what to do........AH HA..................I begin fake conversation about lost keys, sort of strolling a bit..................then I say to them.....................uh......you haven't seen any keys around here have you.....................totally disinterested teenage girl response.........................no................back to teenage age girl dribble..............I keep up the fake conversation about where did you have them last.....yadda, yadda, yadda.............and manage to look down to where the box is......................ok.....it's there...................damn.............I can't get it and check it out............crap.............I leave, finishing fake conversation..........when I get a safe distance away, I look back to make sure they are not taking any interest in THE SPOT................and of :::::::::::::::::course:::::::::::::::::::: they are now wandering away into the distance. Crap. Well, at least I know it's still there. It's cold, it's windy, and I :::ain't::: walking back over there. LOL</font></div>
