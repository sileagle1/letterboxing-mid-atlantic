you can contact Wes Garrison and ask for the clue to be moved to <br/>
your "account". Then you can do any editing, and the Contact the <br/>
Placer button will go to your email.<br/>
If it's on a personal website, I can't see what one could do.<br/>
BTW, there's a whole gob of NJ clues that got transferred over to <br/>
Hello Kitty's account from T&amp;E's when Elyse quit boxing, and Kitty <br/>
really only wanted one of them. Great clues and places, but not <br/>
always a box there.<br/>

<div> </div>
<div>If the website no longer works you might  be able to find it in the Way Back machine.  A site that archives old web pages.  I have found letterbox clues there even though their website no longer worked.  In that case you could just copy the text and paste it into the adopted box listing using a regular LbNA listing instead of the link.  Disconnect the broken link of course.  <br/></div>
