*waves to Hikers and Hounds* Hi you two! Hope to see you down this <br/>
way this summer. Although I have news...<br/>
Sam I am has a new job ! *happy dances* As of mid May I will no <br/>
longer be at Hemlock Overlook. Although I plan on replanting my <br/>
series there. *smirk* I will now be working at a camp near Leesburg. <br/>
(hmmm wonder what I will be doing on my time off, with so many boxes <br/>
near by????)  And maybe planting a few too. :) We shall see.<br/>

trying to find the Dead Authors -- it's the walking bit that <br/>
surprises me. <br/>
<br/>
After seeing up close and inky the wonderful stamps and all the ones <br/>
Sam has 'booked' I decided to move on with carving my personal <br/>
stamp . . .cancel the custom logo one . . . and spend the $25 on gas <br/>
for my CT trip next month.  So no more Avery labels, and a few less <br/>
leaves on the vine.  But just so you don't think I have changed my <br/>
ID, it does say 'sewsowbizzy' even tho the zz looks like gg.<br/>
