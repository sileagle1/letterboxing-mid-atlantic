                    <div id="ygrps-yiv-140720053">Silent Doug and I made a stop in New Hope to do maintenance on <br/>
Persuasion (thanks Irene), which wasn't as quick as it should have <br/>
been because I couldn't remember exactly where I hid the box - d'oh!  <br/>
We sat down to eat our lunch and plan our attack on the Battle of the <br/>
Bands, when it promptly started to rain.  No worries, we have rain <br/>
gear!<br/>
<br/>
So off we went to the Schofield Covered Bridge parking lot.  I was to <br/>
follow clues for VNV Nation while Silent Doug did Radiohead.  I read <br/>
stone bridge as "covered bridge", so we promptly missed that one.  <br/>
Found Radiohead with only minor inability to follow directions.<br/>
<br/>
On to Police, the clues of which I just loved, particularly "every <br/>
breath you take".  Silent Doug and I had a minor disagreement about <br/>
the meaning of the word "south", which involved us taking one of the <br/>
mudiest trails I have ever seen.  Crossing a small stream, I promptly <br/>
sunk in mud up to my knee, no lie.  Waterproof boots really only work <br/>
when you keep the water below the top of your boot.  After realizing <br/>
we were on the wrong track, I realized why Silent Doug thought it was <br/>
funny when I sunk up to my knee when he experienced the same fate, <br/>
though for him it was only mid-calf.  Anyway, for those of you who <br/>
haven't found this box yet, do so; it's got a wonderful hiding spot!!<br/>
<br/>
These boxes were followed by Across the Irish Sea and the Beatles, <br/>
both with no problems.  Then back to find VNV Nation, with a stop for <br/>
a non-battle of the bands box, the Hop Devil.  <br/>
<br/>
Since it was only 4:30 at this point - there's still like 30 minutes <br/>
of dusk, right? - and we weren't completely frozen, we drove off to <br/>
find a few more boxes.  Found NIN and the Grateful Dead with no <br/>
problem, but by the time we got to Frank Zappa, it was so dark we <br/>
couldn't tell which trees were dead and which were alive, so no luck <br/>
there.<br/>
<br/>
All in all, not a bad afternoon; we found 10 boxes, plus one <br/>
hitchhiker, and it only took about 15 minutes to regain sensation in <br/>
my toes with the car heater turned on high.<br/>
<br/>
Once again, a big shout out is due to Carvin' Carmen - nice work!!<br/>
<br/>
Silent Doug and I had selected bands for the battle, but never did <br/>
our share (we suck); does it count for anything that I still have it <br/>
on my to-do list??<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for the hunt!<br/>

You know, I have yet to hunt any of the BOB boxes so will keep your handy tips nearby.

<div>You two should have gone to Isacc Newtown's afterwards to warm up and grab the bonus box hidden there by Miz Scarlet. Next trip I guess.</div>

to look for them.  <br/>
<br/>
The parks did receive a lot of damage.  <br/>
<br/>
The Garden box spot was under three feet of water during Tropical <br/>
Storm Gaston (Aug 31).  The box got free but a fallen tree kept it <br/>
from going down stream.  The Rebellion box was under 6-7 feet of <br/>
water but stayed in place.  I had to dig it out.  <br/>
<br/>
The city cleared most of the park along with the piles of old rock <br/>
and cement where the box was originially hidden.  The new spot is <br/>
still close enough so that I didn't have to change the directions.<br/>
<br/>
I will check on it to make sure it is still there.<br/>

 funny when I sunk up to my knee when he experienced the same <br/>fate, <br/>&gt; &gt; though for him it was only mid-calf.  Anyway, for those of you <br/>who <br/>&gt; &gt; haven't found this box yet, do so; it's got a wonderful hiding <br/>spot!!<br/>&gt; <br/>&gt; <br/>&gt; <br/>&gt; <br/>&gt; <br/>&gt; Yahoo!

<div>I was in NJ this weekend (Fri &amp; Sat) and I had great hopes for letterboxing.  We were staying in Avalon and I headed down to Cape May Point looking for a Walk with the birds.  I forgot my bug spray and the bugs were really bad, then I got flustered and keep looking over my left shoulder instead of my right shoulder.  Once I got back to the car I realized my mistake and that I had actually looked at the stump and it didn't register, don't I feel like an idiot.  Then I went looking for MW Box #1.  I kept following signs for Higsbees beach but I never found the beach.  At this point, I'm totally disguised.  On the way back to Avalon, I stopped to find Hotrod in the Village.  Finally I was successful!!  As I was getting ready to leave the area, I realized that I had lost my cell phone.  Luckily, it was next to this letterbox and not in the swamp at Cape May Point.  At this point I figured I was short on time, and I better
 quit while I was still sane.  The letterboxing wasn't as successful as I had hoped but it was a wonderful day and I thoroughly enjoyed the trails at Cape May Point and Cold Springs area.  My husband wonders why I love doing this, but I'm looking forward to going back and trying again!</div>

<div>I finally got a day to letterbox, so I headed out to Bombay Hook for the 
  Pierre's Vinyl Cut series.  I stopped in the vistor's center to see if 
  the Parson's Point trail was opened and it was.  No eaglets this 
  year.  The lady warned me that there were reports of flies.  I 
  thought I was ready because I had brought my 25% deet spray.  When I hit 
  the first trail, I got about 30 feet before I could not take the flies, so I 
  got back to my car, put on a long sleeve shirt and resprayed myself.  I 
  have never seen so may flies they kept getting between my eyes and glasses but 
  I kept on.  I found 2 of 3 of the boxes and really enjoyed the tower 
  on Bear Swamp trail.  The breeze kept the flies away.  It was a good 
  thing that there has been so much discussion about tick removal, as I was 
  covered in deer ticks.  So much for Deet working.  I may have to be 
  a cold weather letterboxer, because I really hate ticks.&amp; nbsp; But it was 
  fun to get out and box. And towards sunset my husband and I went back out and 
  there was so much wildlife, it was amazing.  That's what I love about 
  letterboxing, there's always an adventure.</div>

When I <br/>&gt; hit the first trail, I got about 30 feet before I could not take <br/>the <br/>&gt; flies, so I got back to my car, put on a long sleeve shirt and <br/>&gt; resprayed myself. I have never seen so may flies they kept getting <br/>&gt; between my eyes and glasses but I kept on. I found 2 of 3 of the <br/>&gt; boxes and really enjoyed the tower on Bear Swamp trail. The breeze <br/>&gt; kept the flies away. It was a good thing that there has been so <br/>much <br/>&gt; discussion about tick removal, as I was covered in deer ticks. So <br/>&gt; much for Deet working. I may have to be a cold weather letterboxer, <br/>&gt;
 because I really hate ticks.&amp; nbsp; But it was fun to get out and <br/>&gt; box. And towards sunset my husband and I went back out and there <br/>was <br/>&gt; so much wildlife, it was amazing. That's what I love about <br/>&gt; letterboxing, there's always an adventure.<br/>&gt; &gt; <br/>&gt; &gt; <br/>&gt; &gt; JuneMcAllister &lt;nfmoon@&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; &gt; I think there's an ointment for that too. <br/>&gt; &gt; <br/>&gt; &gt; mm<br/>&gt; &gt; <br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; [Original Message]<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; From: brendan_hickey13 &lt;brendan_hickey@ &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; To: &lt;<a href="mailto:lbma%40yahoogroups.com" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">lbma@yahoogroups. com</a>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; Date: 6/8/2007 2:27:19 PM<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; Subject: [lbma] Re: Apple Dumpling Gang boxes<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; Sounds like a drinking game...<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; --- In <a href="mailto:lbma%40yahoogroups.com" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">lbma@yahoogroups. com</a>, "JuneMcAllister" &lt;nfmoon@&gt;
