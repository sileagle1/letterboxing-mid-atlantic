clear boxing day for everyone to go boxing.  <br/>
<br/>
So here is a definition of letterboxing off of the internet:<br/>
<br/>
The day after Christmas Day is known as Boxing Day, after the<br/>
tradition of opening the alms boxes placed in churches<br/>
over the Christmas season. The contents were distributed amongst the<br/>
poor of the parish.<br/>
<br/>
December 26 is also known<br/>
as the Feast of St Stephen. It is often a day of outdoor sports and<br/>
horse racing and hunting [for letterboxes].<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
So is anyone else going out boxing in our of this event?</div>

The contents were distributed amongst the<br/>&gt; poor of the parish.<br/>&gt; <br/>&gt; December 26 is also known<br/>&gt; as the Feast of St Stephen. It is often a day of outdoor sports and<br/>&gt; horse racing and hunting [for letterboxes].<br/>&gt; <br/>&gt; <br/>&gt; <br/>&gt; <br/>&gt; So is anyone else going out boxing in our of this event?<br/>&gt; <br/>&gt; <br/>&gt; <br/>&gt; <br/>&gt; <br/>&gt; <br/>&gt; ---------------------------------<br/>&gt; Do you Yahoo!?<br/>&gt;

<div>I tried boxing in the snow once.  Besides the problem of finding something covered by snow, I realized I wasn't being very discrete with my footprints all over the place.  I was looking for one hidden in a log and after 20 minutes of circling realized the log was a little one, under the snow.  </div>
