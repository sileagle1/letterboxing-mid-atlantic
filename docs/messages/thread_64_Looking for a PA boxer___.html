but not necessary, who would be interested in speaking with a <br/>
reporter for a letterboxing news story.<br/>
<br/>
I was recently contacted by a woman from the Sunday News (this is <br/>
apparently a PA newspaper) after she located my clues for the <br/>
Bridges of Lancaster box.  She was not aware that am not from the <br/>
area.  She is interested in doing a LB story, but would prefer to <br/>
speak with somebody in the PA area.  I told her I would try to find <br/>
somebody who may be interested.<br/>
<br/>
If you would be interested in speaking with her, please e-mail me <br/>
offlist and I will forward her message to you so that you can make <br/>
contact with her.<br/>
