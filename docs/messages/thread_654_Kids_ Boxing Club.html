<br/>
Some of the kids from my elementary schools (I travel) have really <br/>
started to get involved in letterboxing, in and out of school. It <br/>
started with my personal traveler, which I hid a few different times <br/>
in the building and let them find during their free time. Then they <br/>
started wanting to see our logbook and hear stories about where the <br/>
Highlander and I had been over the weekends. Now they're taking their <br/>
own recess time to MAKE stamps and scope Atlas Quest, so I'm looking <br/>
forward to seeing where they end up placing their boxes. <br/>
<br/>
It's basically only 1-5 kids at each building, but it's starting to <br/>
look like an unofficial club (even though most of them don't even <br/>
know each other). So, I'm unofficially planning a small box hunt for <br/>
them at the park where 19 boxes from the WNY Gathering were<br/>
(unofficially means I'll tell kids where we'll be and anyone who <br/>
shows up and stays with a parent or guardian wiil be there...that way <br/>
I don't get in trouble for planning a "school function"). <br/>
<br/>
Anyway, I'm really loving the enthusiasm, so I might make a kids <br/>
boxing Yahoo group, if I can. If you know any kids who want to post, <br/>
let me know so I know if this is really worth doing or not.<br/>

yet, but boy, will he laugh at me) Highlander</div>
