The Road Rally is On!<br/>
<br/>
The tentative plan is for January 22 or 23.<br/>
All the boxes will be planted by Jan 20.<br/>
<br/>
It is my goal to run the Rally on the 22 with a weather hold on the <br/>
23.  Because of the <br/>
nature of this event, it is incredibly weather/condition <br/>
contingent.  If necessary, we can <br/>
push it off as far as Spring.<br/>
<br/>
If you interested in carving a stamp for the rally, please contact <br/>
me off-list at <br/>
nattybumppolbna at aol dot com<br/>
If you volunteer, please be sure you can get the stamp done and to <br/>
me by Jan 15<br/>
<br/>
To allow everyone to participate in the rally I will be doing all <br/>
the planting for the event.  <br/>
After the event, you are welcome to replant the stamp elsewhere or <br/>
claim my placement <br/>
and distribute your own clue.  I will waive any claim on the P.<br/>
<br/>
I hope to begin team sign-ups right after Christmas.  I would <br/>
suggest forming teams for <br/>
the rally.  Each vehicle must be separated by enough time to keep <br/>
teams from bunching <br/>
up at box sites. And with many teams in the game this could go on <br/>
all day.<br/>
<br/>
Any suggestions or volunteers for the gathering portion of the day <br/>
are most welcome.<br/>
<br/>
Actually any suggestions at all are welcome.<br/>
