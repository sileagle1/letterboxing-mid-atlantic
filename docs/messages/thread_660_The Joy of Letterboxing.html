<div>Mostly a lurker on the list, but wanted to share my unabashed joy at having finally started this sport 6 months ago.  I've managed to rope many of my family into it as well.</div>

<div>This list has been a great source of entertainment, and I greatly appreciate it.  It's great to just share in something fun.  Letterboxing, and by extension the letterboxing community, has added to my life.</div>

My time outside with my dogs and new friends has been a huge positive impact on my life. While I know my husband wishes I spent a little more time puttering around the house, okay ANY time puttering around the house, he also tells me often how much he enjoys seeing me so happy. Thanks for such a great year folks. You guys are the best. I look forward to meeting many more of you in '05.</div>
