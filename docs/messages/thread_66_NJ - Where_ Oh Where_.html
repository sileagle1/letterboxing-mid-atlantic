after the three Where? Oh Where? NJ mystery boxes today. What a <br/>
great set of clues!<br/>
Box 1 was wet. Box 2 was dry. Box 3 was missing. Really missing, as <br/>
in we found a tattered baggie, then a soggy ink pad, and finally a <br/>
labeled lid, but no bottom, book, or stamp anywhere. We threw out <br/>
what we found as they'd just become litter at that point. I'd heard <br/>
of scattered boxes, but this is the first time we've encountered one.<br/>
If any PCLG people are reading (where DID the "contact us" link go <br/>
on the website?) I hope you can change clue/replace stamp/whatever.<br/>
Bummer. This was a three part stamp, and we can't fill in the hole.<br/>
