&gt;<br/>
&gt;"I got a rock."  Wait, no that was Good Ol' Charlie Brown at Halloween! <br/>
&gt;Anyway, Mr. Irene got me the backpack with the stool thingy attached. Which <br/>
&gt;was posted on the big list awhile ago and then I saw it on Highly Sung and <br/>
&gt;HAD to have it! Hey, where the heck has Highly Sung and the Cahilly's been <br/>
&gt;lately? Okay, back on topic, so anyway this thing is really cool and came <br/>
&gt;in pretty handy yesterday on trail. So far it's holding up but we'll see as <br/>
&gt;I am at the very top end of the weight limit. Still haven't lost those last <br/>
&gt;few extra pounds from my last pregnancy....21 years ago! LOL! I think <br/>
&gt;Mizscarlet got one as well. Alan Marx got his son some boxing stuff too but <br/>
&gt;he can elaborate. Speaking of Alan, his trail name is somecomic. Well Mr. <br/>
&gt;Irene and I went to see his act and he is SOME COMIC! Really great. My <br/>
&gt;husband doesn't care for stand up and he laughed his butt off.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Anyway, whadja get in the way of cool LB stuff? Just being my usual nosey <br/>
&gt;self.<br/>
