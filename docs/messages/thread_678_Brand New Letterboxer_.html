<br/>
I've missed you all so much! I spent a little time this morning<br/>
catching up with the news on the list. Happy holidays to everyone, I<br/>
envy all your recent letterboxing exploits! But we'll be getting back<br/>
into the swing of things real soon!<br/>
<br/>
Our new little letterboxer, Carley Jackson Ebbenga, was born on<br/>
Thursday, December 23 and came home on Christmas Day! She is<br/>
beautiful! We haven't finalized her trail name, but we'd better hurry,<br/>
as we are heading up to Palmyra Cove this afternoon for a very short<br/>
letterboxing excursion (I've missed it so much!)Somehow, we missed<br/>
Mizscarlet's Snail Mail box in October. Irene, if successful, that<br/>
will make Carley's first letterbox at 9 days old! How would that rate<br/>
with your caving club? <br/>
<br/>
We can't wait to see you all at the Road Rally! Although the baby<br/>
might be a handicap for us!<br/>
<br/>
Regarding the discussion on Letterboxing holiday gifts, I was the<br/>
lucky recipient and giver of letterboxing goodies: I gave my<br/>
sister-in-law (from TX) a treasure hunt themed stocking, and included<br/>
a carved personal stamp for her (a depiction of her beloved black lab,<br/>
Bailey), compass, stamp pad, log book, clue sheets to boxes near her,<br/>
and a HH in her honor to plant. (Along with some other fun items that<br/>
went with a treasure hunt theme, just in case she wasn't into it. She<br/>
did come with us to find Oh, Be My Friend in July and loved it.)<br/>
<br/>
My father-in-law gave me the greatest stocking - all outdoor themed! A<br/>
box from LL Bean that included hiking sticks, really nice binoculars,<br/>
a cool nalgene bottle and a GPS unit!! Another SIL gave me a hiking<br/>
book and Smartwool socks (love 'em!)<br/>
<br/>
Welp, a beautiful warm breeze is calling me - I can't wait to get out<br/>
of the house, even for a tiny drive-by! <br/>

way).  What a wonderful Christmas gift.<br/>
<br/>
I look forward to meeting her and seeing you again at the Road Rally.<br/>
 She may actually be a benefit and not a handicap as she distracts all<br/>
of us grandmother types and makes it hard to focus on boxing clues.<br/>

little Carley to the letterboxing gang! Her trail name will be "Lilee"<br/>
-   and her stamp is in the works. Big sister, Gwenllian, is<br/>
absolutely loving finally having a sibling after 14 long years of<br/>
wishing for one!<br/>
<br/>
We did make it out for a TINY letterboxing outing on New Year's Day -<br/>
we found MizScarlet's Snail Mail Box in Palmyra Cove - all in great<br/>
shape, and we left a little something for the next boxer, too. I was<br/>
so happy to get out of the house and the weather was perfect. Carley,<br/>
of course, slept through the entire outing, but we signed her in anyway! <br/>
<br/>
Jan, congrats to you on your F100! Sheesh, I don't know how you all do<br/>
it! Maybe, now that I'm actually mobile again, our count will increase!<br/>
<br/>
Congrats to Silent Doug and Jennifer on your recent move to CT! We'll<br/>
miss you both down here, though!<br/>
