                    <div id="ygrps-yiv-1521698945">Happy New year everyone!  I hope that 2005 is as beautiful and calm <br/>
as the weather was on the trails in the SE PA area this weekend for <br/>
all!  <br/>
<br/>
I ran out of sunlight today so I am anxiously waiting for the arrival <br/>
of spring so that hunts can continue until 8 or 9:00.  <br/>
<br/>
Winky has carved her first stamp, so she went with me this weekend.  <br/>
We grabbed Natty Bumpo and Walker's "America's First Super Highway" <br/>
westbound box yesterday, her first find!<br/>
<br/>
We spent New Years eve in Altoona PA, YIPPEE! and woke early to drive <br/>
to Lancaster PA area this morning by 11:30.  We had a great day.  <br/>
Weather was INCREDIBLE for january 1 and I told Winkie, I bet there <br/>
are a ton of boxers out today.  While there we found "Leap Frog" by <br/>
Thumbs up.  A great hunt with a neat clue.  Awesome hike, hilly <br/>
wooded, neat location.  From there we headed out for Thumbs <br/>
Up's "Underground Railroad" series.  If you haven't gone after this <br/>
one yet, GO!  A great series with a wonderful history lesson about <br/>
people that need to be remembered.  I thought this was a great series <br/>
because of the history, the location and the relevance of the hand <br/>
carved stamps.  Very moving!<br/>
<br/>
OK, now the best part of the day.  I gave my Brother in law a LB kit <br/>
for Christmas and today he went out with my sister for the first <br/>
time.  He called me three times throughout the day to tell me what a <br/>
great time he was having and that my sisiter was climbing over rocks <br/>
and getting messy.  He was so excited and fired up about Letterboxing <br/>
and I thought  "oh oh, another addict is born".  They ended up <br/>
finding four and now his wife, my sister is planning her first <br/>
stamp.  How cool it was to hear him discovering the joy we all find <br/>
when out on the trail.<br/>
<br/>
So, after today, my count stands at 35f 1HHp.<br/>
<br/>
Happy New Year all.<br/>
<br/>
Be good, box well.<br/>

<div>I was "The Mad Hatter" of the Red Hat Boxers when we found Underground 
Railroad. One of my favorite series too! I was so impressed with all of the 
research that went into creating such a thoughtful, moving and informative hunt. 
Yesterday as the Hiker in Hikers &amp; Hounds, I went out with my faithful trail 
Buddy Dude, and Cyclonic, Lightnin' Bug and Jan &amp; Barney, Team Little Dog. 
We found a Mapsurfer box which was very cool. And we almost didn't find it. 
Several of us looked in the exact same spot, finally Lightnin Bug moved enough
