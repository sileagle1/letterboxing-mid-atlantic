                    <div id="ygrps-yiv-1340874609">Another beautiful New Years Day.  Last year (2004) I was out in a <br/>
sweatshirt when the little vikings and I planted our Froggy Hollow <br/>
box.  New Years Day 2005 didn't even require a sweatshirt!  We <br/>
didn't plant a box, but checked on the White's Ferry box -- and were <br/>
pleased to see a few visitors since last check.  Hopped on the ferry <br/>
and visited the boxed at Balls Bluff on the Virginia side.<br/>
<br/>
Got so motivated by that excursion that the littlest viking and I <br/>
went out boxing today in Black Hills Park -- and came home to find <br/>
the postings about a regional gathering at the park -- great idea!  <br/>
It's beautiful -- it was so nice to get on the paths and to <br/>
different areas of the park today.<br/>
