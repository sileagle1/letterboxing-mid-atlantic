Saturday, January 29, 2005<br/>
11:00am to 3:00pm or whenever<br/>
Pentagon City Mall Food Court<br/>
Arlington, VA<br/>
<br/>
Close to Metro, food, and shopping. With good parking (cheap).<br/>
Obviously this isn't a "boxing" gather but a meet, greet, and<br/>
exchange. There is one box there, though, and there are drive bys<br/>
close by. I especially hope to meet new local boxers.<br/>
<br/>
I come early and grab a bunch of tables in the back. We exchange,<br/>
eat, and talk box. Some carving techniques might be shown. Rumor<br/>
has it there may be a mystery dinner. Who knows.<br/>
<br/>
Last year 30 people showed up, and 6 event stamps. (Just one event<br/>
stamp? Pshaw) A couple of people are sending me traveling event <br/>
stamps  There may be a new traveling event stamp introduced.<br/>
Some came to the dinner and not the gather and vice versa.<br/>

You gots to realize, he likes the carving.<br/>
