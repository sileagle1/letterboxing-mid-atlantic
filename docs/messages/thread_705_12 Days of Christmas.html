<p><tt>Gee that series really got a lot of attention!  I hope MizScarlet will let us know how many letterboxers stamped into her log book.  And remember, she has to add one for Warcat 76 who were so frozen and so busy doing exchanges that we forgot to stamp the log!  (How dumb!)</tt></p>

gone, so don't look for it. As of my last check the<br/>
series is still intact. As of my last last count 26<br/>
teams (including Warcat) have stamped in.  It's been a<br/>
tough series to maintain and will be pulled after the<br/>
17th, I will pull the boxes on the AM of the 18th.<br/>
