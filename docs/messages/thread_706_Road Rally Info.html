                    <div id="ygrps-yiv-1532617459">Greetings Everyone,<br/>
<br/>
I am the Rally Master.  And I will be taking over the duties of organizing and posting <br/>
information about the upcoming Letterbox Road Rally:  Where the Rubbermade Meets the <br/>
Road.<br/>
<br/>
Any future inquiries about the rally should be directed to me this yahoo address.  Natty <br/>
Bumppo will be forwarding any inquiries to me, so save yourself some time and send them <br/>
directly to me.<br/>
<br/>
First off, the Road Rally is still awaiting final approval of facilities for January 22 [Weather <br/>
Hold: January 23].  The word will come down this week and I will post it as soon as I know.  <br/>
I thank everyone for their patience.<br/>
<br/>
We have some great stamps in already and we're looking forward to the others.  Keep <br/>
carvin' folks.  Contact me for shipping info.<br/>
<br/>
Let me start with an official sign up:  All those interested in participating, please email me <br/>
with the following info:<br/>
<br/>
The Team Name<br/>
The Trail Names of 1) Driver and 2) Navigator<br/>
[No real names, please]<br/>
The Make/Model/License Plate of the Vehicle to be used.<br/>
[This is for safety reasons and will be explained on-site.  Don't worry if you need to <br/>
change vehicles - that can be accomodated on-site as well]<br/>
<br/>
You may have as many passengers in the vehicle as it may safely carry, but you MUST <br/>
HAVE at least one driver and one navigator.  No Lone Wolves will be permitted for safety <br/>
reasons.<br/>
<br/>
We have many people interested in the rally.  We will be limited by daylight and the need <br/>
to space-out the vehicles.  If the number of entries exceeds the number of time slots <br/>
available, a random drawing will be held prior to the event to determine the entrants.  In <br/>
addition, a drawing will be held to determine post-time of each vehicle.  <br/>
A mandatory organizational meeting will be held in the morning prior to first post-time.  <br/>
All teams must attend for safety reasons. The site is great and has some wonderful boxes <br/>
and room for more.  You can occupy yourself with E-ing, F-ing, X-ing and P-ing prior to <br/>
your post time and after your return before winners are announced.  [I would also suggest <br/>
P-ing BEFORE your post time.  You will not have time to stop en route]<br/>
<br/>
I cannot emphasize the need for safety enough.  Any activity involving motor vehicles is <br/>
inherently dangerous.  Do not enter if you are unsure about your abilities.  This project <br/>
does not require speed.  In fact, anyone caught speeding, anyone caught engaging in <br/>
unsafe activity and anyone who completes the course quicker than the judges official time <br/>
will be disqualified.  A significant breach of safety will result in the cancellation of the <br/>
activity.  You will not be asked to do anything illegal or unsafe in the course of this <br/>
activity.<br/>
<br/>
Have I scared you?  I hope not.  I write these things to remind everyone to be safe while <br/>
they have fun.  I will be posting often this week.  Keep watching.<br/>
<br/>
Yours, Trudy...<br/>
