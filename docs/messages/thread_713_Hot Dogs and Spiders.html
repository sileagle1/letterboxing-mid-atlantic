<div>Imagine my surprise to find I was first to L Bug's Hot Dog Box in Allentown!</div>
<div>Except for my previously reported failed attempts last weekend, I have not had the chance to box since I found Vietnam Memorial in Charlottesville, VA on 11/19.  </div>
<div>I assumed there had been many visitors to Yocco's by now, but I appeared to be the first.  Box is alive and well and dry.  Funny smell coming from the box, though.</div>
<div>Nice job on the stamp, Rich.</div>

I'd have thought that the promise of Barking Spiders would have drawn <br/>
out the hairy leggers.<br/>

The secret to the smell is in the sauce!  Urp.<br/>
