found my first Geocache today.  (I smell a cross addiction). The last <br/>
letterbox had quite a few geocachers in the logbook who had been <br/>
looking for their own treasure!  Does this happen too other folks, or <br/>
is this just a special spot?<br/>

<div>Ahhh, so the tides were finally in your favor. They were our very first 
boxes planted. I found out shortly after doing my 3rd maintenance check in the 
first week (LOL!) that there was a geocache next to the 3rd box. I decided to 
leave the box there anyway. And whenever I do maintenance I usually get a small 
trinket or something in my box which is cool. How was the camo on those?

Got a bit of a late start but we did find one of Mommo's boxes today. <br/>
We were first finders, got a surprise and found our first hitchiker. We <br/>
saw three deer on our outing. A baby ran across the street in front of <br/>
us driving to the site, still gangly legged with spots, then while <br/>
looking for one of the clue spots, looked up and a deer not too far <br/>
away and she / he politely stood while I snapped a photo. Then later <br/>
while walking back saw another sprint thru the woods in front of us. <br/>
Now we are originally from Ga. and have seen Deer on the side of the <br/>
road all the time but this was the first (for me anyway) out walking in <br/>
the woods. Also it was my Birthday and could not have asked for a <br/>
better day. Well I would have liked to have had more time to find more <br/>
boxes but hubby was taking me to dinner so.... The day was great, great <br/>
clues and boxes and am ready for the next outing. Thanks for letting me <br/>
share. <br/>
