<div>Yeah, I would get permission. I was looking into this awhile ago and I believe the guideline is not to make a profit from the use of logo, which I wouldn't. I would just charge for costs. I believe Mitch did the logo and would email him directly. OR I was thinking someone could design something unique for the shirts. I liked Silents Doug's bumpers sticker saying. But I really do like the LBNA logo and thought it would look nice against a tan or light blue T-shirt (white gets so dirty so fast). A single color silk screen is $30, multi color is about $70 which I would add to the cost of the shirts. The shirts themselves, depepending on color and size I can get for $2-$6. So I could probably turn them around for $10 or less but have no idea how to figure shipping costs in advance, etc. So anyway it's something I can certainly do on the east coast anyway. I will get permission as I don't want to get "spanked" again a la the UK Letterboxer fiasco!! </div>

multi-color.  Maybe you could ask for preorders.</span></font></p>

this awhile ago and I believe the guideline is not to make a profit from the
use of logo, which I wouldn't. I would just charge for costs. I believe Mitch
did the logo and would email him directly. OR I was thinking someone could
design something unique for the shirts. I liked Silents Doug's bumpers sticker
saying. But I really do like the LBNA logo and thought it would look nice
against a tan or light blue T-shirt (white gets so dirty so fast). A single
color silk screen is $30, multi color is about $70 which I would add to the
cost of the shirts. The shirts themselves, depepending on color and size I can
get for $2-$6. So I could probably turn them around for $10 or less but have no
idea how to figure shipping costs in advance, etc. So anyway it's something I
can certainly do on the east coast anyway. I will get permission as I don't
want to get "spanked" again a la the UK Letterboxer fiasco!! </span></font></p>

                    <div id="ygrps-yiv-1722742791"><div>Yo! Back from camping with my caving club at Raystwon Lake, Pa. Nice place but a little too "resortish" for me. I like a little more rustic camping but it was very pretty and I did a beautiful cave. ANYWAY, I digress. Wes did gave me permisson to use the logo as long as I don't profit from it. My goal is not to mose my shirt (ha, ha). Judy, thanks for the info. I have so many things to do here. I have to call the screen printer this week for pricing. I work at the wholesale distributor so I can get any color, any size up to 4x. Tan, stonewashed green or blue would look nice and I can easily offer all. I have to figure out shipping. I know I can mail one shirt but if anyone orders several how do I let them know up front what shipping costs would be? I guess I can use my UPS software at work. My other area of concern is buying the shirts. I am a person of very limited means. I am married to a brilliant, but poor, environmental scientist and you know how much money is being spent
 on the environmnet these days! So we're really tight money-wise. I wanted to start with a very small order and see how things went. But I don't want to leave anyone out, either. I love the whole tone of LBMA and we really seem to be very welcoming and friendly and want to keep it that way (Kudos to you Kathryn!). SO I think I might do a pre-order type deal if folks are comfortable with that. I'll get the screen price this week, I know the wieghts of the shirts, and if I get orders in advance I can let folks know how much they will cost. So let me get more info and will get back to you all. In the meantime, my company's blank website is brandbookonline.com. You can view the colors on there if you want. A nice sturdy shirt that holds up well is the Gildan 2000. You can do a search and look at whatever colors you think you'll want. Keep in mind the colors of the logo though. I wouldn't think they would look good on bright colors. I would stay with muted earth tones. But hey,
 it's your shirt, it's your choice, just stay with the 2000 and whatever color you like is fine (if it's in stock when I place the order). I'll get back to you soon about this.</div>

I was looking into this awhile ago <br/>and I believe the guideline is not to make a profit from the use of <br/>logo, which I wouldn't. I would just charge for costs. I believe <br/>Mitch did the logo and would email him directly. OR I was thinking <br/>someone could design something unique for the shirts. I liked Silents <br/>Doug's bumpers sticker saying. But I really do like the LBNA logo and <br/>thought it would look
 nice against a tan or light blue T-shirt (white <br/>gets so dirty so fast). A single color silk screen is $30, multi <br/>color is about $70 which I would add to the cost of the shirts. The <br/>shirts themselves, depepending on color and size I can get for $2-$6. <br/>So I could probably turn them around for $10 or less but have no idea <br/>how to figure shipping costs in advance, etc. So anyway it's <br/>something I can certainly do on the east coast anyway. I will get <br/>permission as I don't want to get "spanked" again a la the UK <br/>Letterboxer fiasco!! <br/>&gt;  <br/>&gt; Irene<br/>&gt; <br/>&gt; The Doubtful Guests &lt;thedoubtfulguests@y...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; LbNA, LbMA t-shirts.  What a cool idea.  I am sure you could write <br/>the main list and figure out how to get permission to use the LbNA <br/>logo.  I know there is someone who does the patches and sells them on <br/>the main list whenever there is enough interest to make a new batch.<br/>&gt;

</span></blockquote>Irene, this sounds great! I'm hopping into the discussion a little late, as<br/>
things have been crazy here. I agree that muted earth tones would be good.<br/>
:) I<br/>
do have a couple of questions, though--things are currently more financially<br/>
tight than usual for us; any chance of this being something other than a<br/>
one-shot deal? Also, how small could you go, size-wise? I'd love to be able to<br/>
get something for my daughter, but she's pretty teeny for her age (20 months),<br/>
and so it would end up being in the infant size range. <br/>
<br/>
Thanks for doing this,<br/>
