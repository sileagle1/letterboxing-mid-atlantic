                    <div id="ygrps-yiv-1979547083">First, let me apologize to all those who are frustrated by my flip-flopping on dates and <br/>
specifics.  My only defense is 1.  I have never done this before.   2.  My first priority is <br/>
safety.  and 3.  I am trying to accomodate as many people as possible.<br/>
<br/>
With that written, let me announce that the date of the Road Rally is Saturday Jan 22 with a <br/>
weather hold on Sunday Jan 23.   The majority of posts/emails opted for the Saturday <br/>
dates.  I know this disappoints some and I am truly sorry.  If I can do anything do make <br/>
things easier by adjusting start times, please let me know.<br/>
<br/>
We currently have 7 teams officially signed up:<br/>
<br/>
1. Team Relentless<br/>
2. Red Hat Boxers<br/>
3. WarCat '76<br/>
4 Team Little Dog<br/>
5. Wink &amp; A Smile<br/>
6. N/A  (Celtic Cat &amp; Wed. Bowler)<br/>
7. Bonnie &amp; Clyde<br/>
<br/>
If you have not signed up yet please do so.  <br/>
If the date change eliminates you from the rally, please let me know asap.<br/>
If you have a start time preference [Morn.  Late Morn. Afternoon]  let me know and I will do <br/>
what I can to accomodate you.  PLEASE EMAIL ME WITH THIS INFO:  <a href="mailto:rallymastr@..." rel="nofollow" target="_blank">rallymastr@...</a><br/>
<br/>
In addition to the official rules, which I will post this week, there will be vital last-minute <br/>
info to be given out before the rally.  Please make plan to be at the start as early as you <br/>
can.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks,<br/>
