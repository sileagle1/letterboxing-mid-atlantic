<div> </div>
<div>I celebrated Tuesday AM by going up to Washington's Crossing for Capt. Moore's Insignia, and on Thursday I found Myke's Lost Cats--all in good shape.  Then Thursday night my sisters &amp; I went to see Somecomic perform--had a blast &amp; got his special personal traveler (fortunately even a BAD joke counts if he hasn't heard it yet!).</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Spent quite a while at the Wissahickon Public Library today but had to go home disappointed--there is one more clue I haven't figured out.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Hopefully tomorrow we will finish up the Chester County Hat Trick; then that will probably be it for the week.  </div>
