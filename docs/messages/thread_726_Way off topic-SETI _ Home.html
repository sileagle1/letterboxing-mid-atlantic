Papa Woodwose here in MD. Long time no post, and it's not even about <br/>
boxing, but I love this and had to pass it on. Just funky enough to <br/>
turn on computer savy boxers. <br/>
I know many folks on here are volunteers by nature so I thought I<br/>
might share a quick interest of mine that ya'll can volunteer your<br/>
computers for one of the most important cultural causes in human<br/>
history, IMHO.<br/>
To quote their website.<br/>
"SETI@home is a scientific experiment that uses Internet-connected<br/>
computers in the Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence (SETI).<br/>
You can participate by running a free program that downloads and<br/>
analyzes radio telescope data."<br/>
If you aren't familar with SETI, they are the organization founded<br/>
in part by the Plantary Society, created by Carl Sagan. SETI is a<br/>
reputable science organization funded by Uni. Berekely and others.<br/>
They often mistakenly lumped into the UFO clump but the are by far<br/>
not. The SETI@Home screensaver is the first of what is known<br/>
as 'distributed computing', using home pc to function as a sort of<br/>
super super-computer. It uses the time your cpu would normally be<br/>
running screensavers and puts the cpu cycles to use. It is totally<br/>
safe and no more technical than running a screensaver. It analyzes<br/>
data and when you log onto the net, it asks to download that and<br/>
bring up more. If you wish, you can run your normal screensaver and<br/>
run the SETI as a background program, although I like seeing the<br/>
bargraph running showing my progress in examining the noises of the<br/>
stars. To date over 2.5 million users have loaded it and contributed<br/>
1000's of years of cpu time!!! Completely safe and doable for even<br/>
the most untech cpu user. Find it and answers at<br/>
<a href="http://setiathome.ssl.berkeley.edu/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://setiathome.ssl.berkeley.edu/</a><br/>
I have always wanted to be part of this and never had a cpu modern<br/>
enough to handly it. Very proud to have contributed over 26 hours of<br/>
cpu time to the search so far and counting. Other distributed<br/>
computing programs are out there, many involving genome research.<br/>
One day we just might find out that we aren't the center of <br/>
attention.<br/>
Much Peace,<br/>
