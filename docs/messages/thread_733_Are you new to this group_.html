<div>Someone I respect on the yahoogroup DogsLovetoRun mentioned letterboxing and geocaching as something she does with her son about a year ago.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Then about a month ago through Freecycle I gave away a dog saddlebag to someone who wanted it for her dog when they geocaching.  I asked her about geocaching, looked into it, am not up to spending the money on a GPS unit right now, but reading through the geocaching site there was a reference to letterboxing. . .. which I looked into and was fascinated.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>I love to hike.  My husband loves to hike.  My dog loves to hike.  We all need more exercise.  My daughter (almost 5) prefers to sit and do nothing, and then complain she's bored.  She is interested in the idea of treasure-hunting, and loved helping follow the clues for our first find.  Stamps and ink pads are also very exciting for her.  Even my husband is becoming interested (and he usually thinks everything we do is crazy).<br/></div>
<div>I'm getting my friends interested, so there will be crews of us (mostly moms and kids and dogs) looking for boxes in NJ and NY.  Then we'll start planting. . . .</div>

winter wind...allow me to jump in and introduce myself:  I'm new <br/>
here!<br/>
<br/>
I'm the youngest son of a wood carving instructor, I'm an eccentric <br/>
history buff, obsessive mystery fan, compulsive follower of <br/>
paranormal culture &amp; a Northern Virginia Native. I used to own my <br/>
own consulting firm but now have a goverment job. I recently bought <br/>
a home in Prince William Va and live their with my grlfriend her <br/>
teenaged son and two Dachshunds<br/>
<br/>
I saw the feature article in the Washington Post Weekend section <br/>
back in 03. I visited the LBNA web site and bookmarked it. But it <br/>
was just few weeks ago when I finally got around to carving a stamp. <br/>
I found the hardest part about getting started was figuring out what <br/>
my personal stamp should be. I saw der Mad Stampers page and was a <br/>
little intimidated. But I've created a couple of "ok" stamps now and <br/>
I anxious to get going. I have been involved in many annual treasure <br/>
hunts at a local pub as a participant and then eventually as <br/>
organizer. I love solving and writing clues. I am very familiar with <br/>
the history and terrain of NoVa. I'm real anxious to get out and <br/>
start solving clues and finding boxes. I look forward to placing <br/>
boxes of my own. <br/>
<br/>
I've only hunted for one box and I couldn't find it. I don't know if <br/>
I looked in the wrong place or it simply wasn't there. I suspect it <br/>
was removed by non letterboxers because the area was so open. I love <br/>
hiking and exploring but before I set out for other boxes I'd like <br/>
to have some reasonable expectation they are still in place.<br/>
<br/>
I'm not aware if anybody I know Letterboxes, so I welcome the advice <br/>
&amp; suggestions from members of this group.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks in advance!<br/>

<div> </div>
<div>I am not very familiar with the Prince William Boxes.  The Pirates of Sunset Grace were there last summer.  Some of the Scooby series, in the same park are also there but I understand the planter is working up a new expanded series there with guest carvers (including me).  </div>
<div> </div>
<div>First Manassas was in place last summer but you never know.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>I believe Witchiepoo is still in the hobby.  I think I've seen her stamp around recently.  But a lot of people go dormant through the winter so don't be surprised if people do not respond.  </div>
<div> </div>
<div>I just did the Tribute to the Beatles series at Lake Accotink.  That was a very satisfying series. Search for an earlier post of mine probably titled, Where are you boxing this weekend, for a list of boxes I just visited. </div>
<div> </div>
<div>Come to the Icebreaker gather on Saturday and can get a lot of information.  </div>

I used to own my <br/>own consulting firm but now have a goverment job. I recently bought <br/>a home in Prince William Va and live their with my grlfriend her <br/>teenaged son and two Dachshunds<br/><br/>I saw the feature article in the Washington Post Weekend section <br/>back in 03. I visited the LBNA web site and bookmarked it. But it <br/>was just few weeks ago when I finally got around to carving a stamp. <br/>I found the hardest part about getting started was figuring out what <br/>my personal stamp should be. I saw der Mad Stampers
 page and was a <br/>little intimidated. But I've created a couple of "ok" stamps now and <br/>I anxious to get going. I have been involved in many annual treasure <br/>hunts at a local pub as a participant and then eventually as <br/>organizer. I love solving and writing clues. I am very familiar with <br/>the history and terrain of NoVa. I'm real anxious to get out and <br/>start solving clues and finding boxes. I look forward to placing <br/>boxes of my own. <br/><br/>I've only hunted for one box and I couldn't find it. I don't know if <br/>I looked in the wrong place or it simply wasn't there. I suspect it <br/>was removed by non letterboxers because the area was so open. I love <br/>hiking and exploring but before I set out for other boxes I'd like <br/>to have some reasonable expectation they are still in place.<br/><br/>I'm not aware if anybody I know Letterboxes, so I welcome the advice <br/>&amp; suggestions from members of this group.<br/><br/>Thanks in advance!<br/><br/>Gallant

                    <div id="ygrps-yiv-444257101">Thanks for the tip about the Beatles Tribute. It's discouraging when <br/>
you go hunt for your first box... only to meet <br/>
with frusttration over not finding it. Thanks to your advice I have <br/>
found my first four! I started Saturday by searching for the mystery <br/>
box "Bastion".... what was supposed to be a "drive by" took several <br/>
hours... which is my excuse for being late to the Pentagon City <br/>
Icebreaker and missing meeting you all. So I went to Lake Accotink <br/>
and finally had some Letterbox success. I'm hooked.</div>
