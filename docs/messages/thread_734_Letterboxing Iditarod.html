<br/>
Why not take advantage of the threatening weather and stage a Letterboxing Iditarod.  I <br/>
could use the hiding places planned for the Road Rally and we could just use sleds and <br/>
dogs.<br/>
<br/>
Who's In?<br/>
<br/>
I will need 7-10 sledding themed stamps by tomorrow.  Who's got a quick knife?<br/>
<br/>
Email me by midnight so I can start brewing the flaming rum punch - it should be nearly <br/>
cold enough by tomorrow.<br/>

PS  Can you tell Princess Perfect is feeling better?  She's out of the hospital and on the way <br/>
to a full recovery.  Thank you to everyone for their kind words and prayers  I am on my <br/>
way back to (my version of) sanity.  Please let <a href="mailto:Rallymastr@..." rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Rallymastr@...</a> know about your <br/>
available dates for the re-scheduled Road Rally.  It would be a shmae to waste some of the <br/>
truly beautiful stamps I have waiting.<br/>

Hooray! We're so glad to hear that Princess Perfect is home and<br/>
feeling better! I hope you can get some rest now, too! <br/>
<br/>
Hopefully, we'll be able to participate in the resheduled Road Rally -<br/>
we'll watch to see what date is good for everyone and then chime in if<br/>
we can make it.<br/>
