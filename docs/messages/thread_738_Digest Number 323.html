<br/>
Yes, we're NEW to Letterboxing as well and to the LBMA Yahoo group as well. My husband and I started Geocachinng, which is all well and good with a tecchie like him, but I love the clue aspect of Letterboxing. I carved my first stamp a week ago and set out to find a letterbox (Frankenbox) in our neighborhood. It was great fun finding it and using my stamp for the first time. We are BLUE HEELER, which makes sense to us, since when we go out we take Sheila, our Australian Cattle Dog with us as well as our 10 year old son. The stamp I carved has a cartoon image of Sheila and the words Blue Heeler. We look forward to perhaps meeting some other letterboxers inside the DC Beltway. Cheers!  Beth<br/>
