With good parking (cheap).<br/>Obviously this isn't a "boxing" gather but a meet, greet, and<br/>exchange. There is one box there, though, and there are drive bys<br/>close by. I especially hope to meet new local boxers.<br/><br/>I come early and grab a bunch of tables in the back. We exchange,<br/>eat, and talk box. Some carving techniques might be shown. </font></div>
<div><font face="Courier New"></font> </div>
<div>Agenda:</div>
<div> </div>
<div>10am - I, and anyone else, arrives early to grab tables in the back.</div>
<div>11am - Hellos and sig stamp name tag stamps.</div>
<div>Noon - (and anytime) food from the food court</div>
<div>All Times - Exchanges, event stamps, hidden stamps, event log, yak show and tell.</div>
<div>1pm - Group picture.  Who's got a good camera?</div>
<div>1:15pm - possible stamp carving lesson</div>
<div>3pm - most people have wondered off</div>
<div> </div>
<div><font face="Courier New">Last year 30 people showed up, and 6 event stamps. (Just one event<br/>stamp? Pshaw) A couple of people are sending me traveling event<br/>stamps There may be a new traveling event stamp introduced.  </font></div>
<div><font face="Courier New"></font> </div>
<div><font face="Courier New">This is not official with the mall, just people meeting informally in the food court.  No one hassled us last year but there is always that possibility.  As long as we are buying from the food stalls they shouldn't care.  They bring in buses full of tourists all the time.</font></div>
<div><font face="Courier New"></font><font face="Courier New"> </font></div>
<div>Oh, and yes, the first treasure hunt is to figure out where, in that big court, we are.  :-)<br/><font face="Courier New"><br/>Scarab of the Doubtful Guests</font></div>
