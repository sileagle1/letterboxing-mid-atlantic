<br/>
Thanks, y'all, so much for the kind welcome! AS much as we would love to attend the Pentagon City event, alas, we cannot as my husband is in charge of the Pinewood Derby for our son's scout troop. We would love to know about any future gatherings and will keep posted to this message board. Yesterday, before the snow got too thick we went for a walk near our house and found letterbox number two for us: Bride of Frankenbox. What a great stamp! Rich, if you're out there, you're very clever! We live near Falls Church High School and Fairview Park and will start our search fanning out from there.<br/>
<br/>
Cheers! Beth  aka Blue Heeler<br/>
