                    <div id="ygrps-yiv-1942140094">Hi!<br/>
<br/>
We're thinking of vacationing in the mid-Atlantic region in late <br/>
May.  We particularly enjoy hiking in the mountains.  We generally <br/>
enjoy trails that are 3-15 miles in length.  Since we discovered <br/>
letterboxing we really enjoy it if we can find this type of trail <br/>
that also has letterboxes along the way.  We thought the mountain <br/>
areas in Virginia might be good.<br/>
<br/>
We met a few of you when we were at the Monster Mash in October and <br/>
are hoping you might be able to give us some suggestions or advice <br/>
re: hikes &amp; letterboxes in the area.  We are researching the LBNA <br/>
site and AtlasQuest for clues, but it is slow going to try to find <br/>
those that might be a longer hike.  I'd therefore really appreciate <br/>
it if any of you could point us in the right direction for longer <br/>
hikes. (Of course we'll also do some shorter walks, but will try to <br/>
plan the trip around the long hikes.)<br/>
<br/>
You can post to this list or email me directly if you have any info <br/>
to share.<br/>

THANK YOU!<br/>

<div> </div>
<div>Catoctin Mountain, just over the line, in MD has some great trails, I understand, but the boxes there I believe are on the short ones.  </div>
<div> </div>
<div>The Sarah Special and Mystic, in Paris VA are in the foothills.  Mtns not that high, nor hike that long, but a couple of nice boxes.  Don't know what their status is.  </div>
<div> </div>
<div>I see that Family Man already mentioned the Shenandoah Valley so I won't repeat.  </div>
<div> </div>
<div>If you are interested in a different long hike with wildly varying terrain, there is the Potomac Heritage Trail along the Potomac River.  You can google it for a lot of information.  It varies with lots of elevation changes from citified park area, to riverside trail, to under nice bridges and junky bridges, to suburbs, to rocks, cliffs, and the Potomac gorge in Great Falls Park.  There are more than a dozen boxes up and down it in the many local side parks. (Ok, yes I planted several of them.)  None of this is "spectacular mountain stuff" but it is pretty serious hiking.  I think it is maintained by the local Appalachian Trail Club.  I think there are remote parts of it that few people ever hike.  </div>

<div>Hope you can time your visit with the May gather in MD, on the 21st I think.  </div>

</span></blockquote>Welcome.<br/>
<br/>
OK, if you want longer letterboxing hikes, forget Virginia, and head a few hours north to Pennsylvania.  Plenty of hilly, rocky, hiking excitement.  Did I mention it was rocky?<br/>
<br/>
You can check out Stamp Collection (<a href="http://www.geocities.com/shredmtb/stampcollection.html)" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.geocities.com/shredmtb/stampcollection.html)</a>.  SE and SW are long hikes in French Creek State Park, and NE and NW are long hikes in Blue Marsh Lake (well, not in the lake).<br/>
<br/>
NE and NW can be combined with Mothra Returns! (<a href="http://www.letterboxing.org/BoxView.asp?boxnum=12402&amp;boxname=Mothra_Returns!" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.letterboxing.org/BoxView.asp?boxnum=12402&amp;boxname=Mothra_Returns!</a>) and Little Alien’s Big Brother (<a href="http://www.letterboxing.org/BoxView.asp?boxnum=12403&amp;boxname=Little_Alien%E2%80%99s_Big_Brother)" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.letterboxing.org/BoxView.asp?boxnum=12403&amp;boxname=Little_Alien%E2%80%99s_Big_Brother)</a> to make a trek that is about 7 miles round trip.<br/>
<br/>
If that has not worn you out, the next day head up to Hamburg PA.  After shopping at Cabalas you can head to the Halk Mountain Preserve, and a portion of the Appalachian Trail.  Here you will find Pinnacle (<a href="http://www.letterboxing.info/box/marty/pinnacle.php)" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.letterboxing.info/box/marty/pinnacle.php)</a> Pulpit Rock (<a href="http://www.letterboxing.info/box/marty/pulpitrock.php)" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.letterboxing.info/box/marty/pulpitrock.php)</a> and Pulpit Rock Observatory (<a href="http://www.letterboxing.org/BoxView.asp?boxnum=9904&amp;boxname=Pulpit_Rock_Observatory)" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.letterboxing.org/BoxView.asp?boxnum=9904&amp;boxname=Pulpit_Rock_Observatory)</a>, about a 9 mile round trip trek, and a pretty view too.<br/>
<br/>
Still want a little more?  South Mountain near Allentown has the South Mountain Series (<a href="http://www.letterboxing.org/BoxView.asp?boxnum=10076&amp;boxname=South_Mountain_Series)" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.letterboxing.org/BoxView.asp?boxnum=10076&amp;boxname=South_Mountain_Series)</a>, three boxes including a HHH that is a little 5 mile jaunt.<br/>
<br/>
Finally, if you are lucky, and Lightn' Bug and I can pull it off in time, there will be another series along the AT on some rough sections (but pretty), a bunch of boxes, and lots of hiking.<br/>
<br/>
When you are finally worn out, be sure to stop at Knoebels (www.knoebels.com) on your way home, possibly the best family amusement park in the nation (and it is cheap).<br/>

                    <div id="ygrps-yiv-1980795144">I will agree with that!  However, there are still more longer hikes <br/>
that lure us.  Hickory Run State Park contains 2 Mapsurfers with <br/>
actual straihtforward clues.  One requires some field math, but the <br/>
other is about a 7 mile RT to a really cool boulder field.  These <br/>
have not been conquered by Hairy Leggers yet, so perhaps I can <br/>
influence along those lines.<br/>
<br/>
The cool thing is I take that week off, so I am hoping to meet up <br/>
with the Wisconsinites.<br/>
