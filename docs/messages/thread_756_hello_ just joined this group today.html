                    <div id="ygrps-yiv-1872069852">Hello!<br/>
I just found and joined this group today, but we have been <br/>
letterboxing for almost exactly one year now. We - our family of 5 - <br/>
go by the name Silver Vikings, although we're not that old yet (at <br/>
least 3 of us *G*) and neither are we Vikings .... well depends from <br/>
where you look at this :) We are originally from Germany and moved <br/>
to the USA about 4 years ago. So maybe you could say, we're kind of <br/>
very Southern Vikings, although we were all born in the part that <br/>
used to belong to the Roman empire long long ago, so we look more <br/>
like those Southern Europeans, nothing Nordic at all ... I don't <br/>
really know how we got this name, it was a brainstorming effort of <br/>
the kids and they like to play "Age of Empires", so who knows? :))<br/>
<br/>
Nonetheless we're here, love treasure hunting um, letterboxing and <br/>
are happy that sometime over the summer our area here in SW-PA got a <br/>
bit more active than it seemed to be when we started out. Several <br/>
new boxes got planted, a few more people got involved .... okay, it <br/>
still is no comparison to Eastern PA and everywhere else near there <br/>
or in the New England States :) Nonetheless, with the very first box <br/>
we un-dig from the snow and ice one year ago, we found a hitchhiker <br/>
(Travelling Pants) and were sooooooo excited. Especially as it had <br/>
taken us sometime to dicover the right spot ;) We usually start <br/>
looking for the boxes on the wrong side of the path or get the <br/>
directions a bit mixed up .... fortunately we have the good excuse <br/>
of language problems ;) .... but up to now, we never had to give up, <br/>
fought nesting ants, undig several trashbags before the right one, <br/>
wandered endlessly around hundreds of rocks to find the two rocks on <br/>
top of each other .... each time the dad wants to call it quits and <br/>
nonetheless we persevere ....and succeed. It is fun!<br/>
<br/>
I knew about letterboxing for a long time. I think I read this first <br/>
article in the National Geographic a long time ago, but somehow <br/>
never got into it.<br/>
3 years ago a new neighbor told me at the school bus stop that they <br/>
enjoyed that their move brought them to a new area for <br/>
letterboxing .... I was fascinated .... and forgot again about it.<br/>
Almost 2 years ago - I think- I read another article in an Airline's <br/>
Magazine ... and this time there was the web adress of lbna added. I <br/>
wrote it down. Again it took some time until I checked it out, but <br/>
finally ... kaboom!<br/>
<br/>
We are not the most avid letterboxers around, too many other <br/>
competing activities. Best is when we can go letterboxing while <br/>
riding our bikes (there are a few impatient family members who need <br/>
to go fast)*G*<br/>
<br/>
I am glad I found this list. It sounds like a lot of fun and <br/>
inspiration. I definitely would love to find out about a meeting in <br/>
case it ever took place in a not too distant place ... who knows...<br/>
<br/>
Wishing you all a happy "hunting" season!<br/>

<div>Welcome Silver Vikings! Why, your hunting challenges sounds just like ours! Even though I am born and raised in PA, I'm thinking it must be a language problem for us as well. I let my dog read the clues and he usually mis-interprets them! LOL! There are several gatherings coming up, one this weekend in DC. Hope to meet you there!</div>

Thanks for the welcome. Well, THIS weekend definitely is a bit of a <br/>
short notice, plus it is coooooooold!! ;) Hopefully we'll be able to <br/>
make it to a meeting/gathering sometime in spring or summer. Will <br/>
they get posted on the calendar?<br/>

I know there is one coming up in May in Maryland and someone, I think Hexacat, mentioned getting one together in Lewes, DE. but I don't remember any firm plans.
