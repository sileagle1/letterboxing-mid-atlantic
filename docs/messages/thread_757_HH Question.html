<div>Hey ya'll...........From what I always see on the big bb, it seems like most HH disappear into the Letterbox Black Hole, never to be seen again. I have a couple of stamps that I want to make into HH but as procrastination is my middle name, I have yet to do. But I really hate the idea of carving the stamp, setting the little guys out on their way, and having them just seem to go poof at some point. From the posts I see, most people are always looking for their HH that have gone missing.</div>

something from all but two of those stamps. I would say that it is <br/>
true that the hitchhikers seem to fall into a black hole. But you <br/>
eventually hear something about them every now and then. It just <br/>
takes a really long time. There is that chance though that you will <br/>
never hear anything from them or the stamp. It is just the risk that <br/>
you take when starting a HH.  Another reason could be that it sits <br/>
in a box for a couple months too. I found a hitchhiker called Paul <br/>
Bunyan and Babe that had been in the box for 9 months. <br/>

You would not believe the lengths I had to go to...I still haven't mail it back out. I have another all done and ready to go since October, but just don't have the energy to constantly be chasing it down....instead I have been bringing it to gatherings.<br/><br/><b><i>Becky Rink &lt;Beckyrink@...&gt;</i></b> wrote:

 ya'll...........From what I always see on the big bb, it seems like <br/>&gt;most HH disappear into the Letterbox Black Hole, never to be seen again. I <br/>&gt;have a couple of stamps that I want to make into HH but as procrastination <br/>&gt;is my middle name, I have yet to do. But I really hate the idea of carving <br/>&gt;the stamp, setting the little guys out on their way, and having them just <br/>&gt;seem to go poof at some point. From the posts I see, most people are always <br/>&gt;looking for their HH that have gone missing.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;Any opinions?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;MissMoon<br/><br/><br/></tt></blockquote></span></blockquote></div><p>

 I've found that, despite thinking I'd be frantic over not hearing<br/>
 from them (and I've rarely heard from my 3), that it's not as<br/>
 devastating to not hear about them. I guess I figure that they're out<br/>
 there somewhere, and a lot of people just aren't curteous enough to<br/>
 report back about them...<br/>
