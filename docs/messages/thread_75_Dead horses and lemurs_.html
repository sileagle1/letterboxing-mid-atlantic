                    <div id="ygrps-yiv-1331765303">I really am fascinated by the interactions on the main Yahoo site.  <br/>
When we began boxing in 2002 I was terrified of expressing a strong <br/>
opinion for fear of flames and backlash.  We entered the group soon <br/>
after one member had been ousted for hate mail and we were far too <br/>
excited about our new hobby to chance being ostracized.  But sitting <br/>
by watching people abuse each other became extremely difficult, <br/>
especially when my friends were being bashed.  <br/>
<br/>
For a while I was really torn up about it, wanting to catch up on <br/>
the goings-on but fearful of reading yet another slam.  It was <br/>
making my stress relieving hobby a real drag.  My solution was to <br/>
ignore as much as I could and to be sarcastic and subversive <br/>
whenever that was not possible.  People take themselves way too <br/>
seriously so I tried to poke a hole in their egos with a little <br/>
absurdity.  <br/>
<br/>
So I guess the whole point of this long-winded puff piece is this: I <br/>
am sarcastic and a bit off center.  And I talk a lot, which on this <br/>
site means I will post a lot.  And most of it will be garbage, <br/>
really strange, or dripping with sarcasm.  (and occasionally in <br/>
incomplete sentences, and always with parentheses)  Consider <br/>
yourselves warned.<br/>

Tammy, <br/>
So nice to see you on this list! Welcome Welcome!  I have often <br/>
enjoyed your posts to the main Yahoo list. Very witty and sarcastic, <br/>
true, but all in good fun!  <br/>
<br/>
I have been lucky enough to seek and find some of the beautiful boxes <br/>
carved and placed by the ADG. Well worth seeking, I must say. I look <br/>
forward to hearing of more boxes planted, and of your own <br/>
missdirected misscreant missadventures! (I did get you all right, <br/>
right?) <br/>

a dead cat!  "101 and uses for a dead cat" was required reading when <br/>
I was in grade school.  I don't remember beating lemurs as one of <br/>
the options but maybe it was too progressive for the time. However I <br/>
do remember the day when dead lemur beaters would be put in the <br/>
stockade or pummeled with stones.  (lottery, anyone?)<br/>
<br/>
In 1889, my great uncle, Horatio Lemures Moneke the Third, was <br/>
caught beating dead lemurs in public so they hung him upside down <br/>
and threw snakes at him until he repented.  Be thankful that dead <br/>
lemur beater persecution has ended and don't forget the martyrs that <br/>
got us here.<br/>

&gt; When we began boxing in 2002 I was terrified of expressing a <br/>
strong <br/>
&gt; opinion for fear of flames and backlash.  We entered the group <br/>
soon <br/>
&gt; after one member had been ousted for hate mail and we were far too <br/>
&gt; excited about our new hobby to chance being ostracized.  But <br/>
sitting <br/>
&gt; by watching people abuse each other became extremely difficult, <br/>
&gt; especially when my friends were being bashed.  <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; For a while I was really torn up about it, wanting to catch up on <br/>
&gt; the goings-on but fearful of reading yet another slam.  It was <br/>
&gt; making my stress relieving hobby a real drag.  My solution was to <br/>
&gt; ignore as much as I could and to be sarcastic and subversive <br/>
&gt; whenever that was not possible.  People take themselves way too <br/>
&gt; seriously so I tried to poke a hole in their egos with a little <br/>
&gt; absurdity.  <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; So I guess the whole point of this long-winded puff piece is this: <br/>
I <br/>
&gt; am sarcastic and a bit off center.  And I talk a lot, which on <br/>
this <br/>
&gt; site means I will post a lot.  And most of it will be garbage, <br/>
&gt; really strange, or dripping with sarcasm.  (and occasionally in <br/>
&gt; incomplete sentences, and always with parentheses)  Consider <br/>
&gt; yourselves warned.<br/>
