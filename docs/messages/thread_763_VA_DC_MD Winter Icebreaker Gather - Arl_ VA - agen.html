<div><font face="Courier New">2nd Annual Winter Icebreaker Gather<br/>Saturday, January 29, 2005<br/>11:00am to 3:00pm or whenever<br/>Pentagon City Mall Food Court<br/>Arlington, VA</font><font face="Courier New"><br/><br/>Close to Metro, food, and shopping. With good parking (cheap).<br/>Obviously this isn't a "boxing" gather but a meet, greet, and<br/>exchange. There is one box there, though, and there are drive bys<br/>close by. I especially hope to meet new local boxers.<br/><br/>I come early and grab a bunch of tables in the back. We exchange,<br/>eat, and talk box.  </font></div>
<div><font face="Courier New"></font> </div>
<div>Agenda:</div>
<div> </div>
<div>10am - I, and anyone else, arrives early to grab tables in the back.  Start sign up sheet for clue stamps desemination.</div>
<div>10:55am - Disoriented letterboxers, deprived of T-intersections, double trees, and compass coordinates desperately attempt to find each other in a strange environment.</div>
<div>11am - Hellos. Sig stamp name tags.</div>
<div>11:01am - collect and shuffle all the Clue clue stamps.  Randomly choose the "answer", and start passing out clues in order of sign in.  Pass out Clue clue sheets.  Then the Clue Game Exchange can begin.  (Note: Stamp carvers are guaranteed a stamp clue, not necessarily theirs.)</div>
<div>11:45am - (and anytime) food from the food court.  Better get it now before the crowds.</div>
<div>All Times - Exchanges, event stamps, hidden stamps, event log, yak show and tell.</div>
<div>12:45pm - Do we have a Clue winner?  Other shenanigans?</div>
<div>12:46 - Start collecting the Clue clues you didn't get yet.</div>
<div>1pm - Group picture.  Who's got a good camera?  Hold up your Clues and the Board.</div>
<div>1:15pm - possible stamp carving lesson</div>
<div>3pm - most people have wondered off.</div>
<div>5:30 pm.  Rebus happy hour?</div>
<div> </div>
<div><font face="Courier New">Last year 30 people showed up, and 6 event stamps. (Just one event<br/>stamp? Pshaw) A couple of people are sending me traveling event<br/>stamps. There may be a new traveling event stamp introduced.  </font></div>
<div><font face="Courier New"></font> </div>
<div><font face="Courier New">This is not official with the mall, just people meeting informally in the food court.  No one hassled us last year but there is always that possibility.  As long as we are buying from the food stalls they should be happy.  They bring in buses full of tourists all the time.</font></div>
<div><font face="Courier New"></font><font face="Courier New"> </font></div>
<div>Oh, and yes, the first treasure hunt is to figure out where, in that big court, we are.  :-)</div>
<div> </div>
<div>CLUE Game Exchange Rules:</div>
<div>--------------------------</div>
<div>- All stamp entries must be in by 11am.</div>
<div>- I will put them in plain envelopes by type, and shuffle and choose the answer as per standard Clue rules.</div>
<div>- When you ask someone for a regular exchange, also ask, "Do you have a Clue?"  If they have a Clue clue they stamp it into your log along with their exchange.  Do not tell what the stamp "IS".  </div>
<div>NOTICE: Part of the fun will be identifying the stamps without labels.</div>
<div>- Keep track of what you receive on the Clue clue sheets (study it carefully.)</div>
<div>- Make an Accusation, as per Clue rules, to me at any time.  Except that unlike Clue, I will check for the correct answer (so noone accidently blurts any information out).</div>
<div>- The first winner receives a copy of the game, upon which we all will stamp the Clue stamps on the board.</div>
<div>- I hope that all stamps will be donated to become a traveling event set to play at other events.<br/><font face="Courier New"></font></div>
<div><font face="Courier New">Look forward to seeing you and letting all these butterflies go,<br/>Scarab of the Doubtful Guests</font></div>
<div><font face="Courier New">and it sure is icy out there</font><br/></div></div><p>
