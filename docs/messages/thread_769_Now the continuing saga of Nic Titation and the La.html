<div>Thinking back to those evil eyes glaring at her, Nic knew that if Hikers and Hounds was involved, this was going to get ugly. H&amp;H was bad news.  Real bad news. Along with her sociopath sidekick, Dude, she ran with the Red Hats. The Red Hats were known up and down the eastern seaboard as one of the most vicious and glittery letterbox gangs around. If MissMoon worked for her, that meant that she too was a Red Hat. And if they were behind whatever was going on here, the String Cheese Incident would look like a hike in the Pennsylvania woods compared to what was to come. </div>
<div> </div>
<div>"When's your boss due back from Dartmoor?" she asked MissMoon. </div>
<div>"She's due back on Groundhog Day" </div>
<div>"Groundhog Day? Why GroundHog Day?"</div>
<div>"She planning on a big GroundHog Day letterbox scheme that's set up to send people out into the cold and slush looking for boxes that don't really exist." </div>
<div>"MY GOD, the woman is evil personified. She must be stopped." </div>
<div>"If I can't find that 13th box before she returns, there is going to be heck to pay, heck I tell you!" She began to weep. WAHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH!.....................</div>
