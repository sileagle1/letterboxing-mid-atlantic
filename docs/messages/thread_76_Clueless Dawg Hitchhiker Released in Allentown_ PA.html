area.  Think of the Clueless Dawg not as a normal Hitchhiker, but as <br/>
a loyal `Traveling Companion.'  That is, at least until he gets to <br/>
rest at your next Letterbox!  At that point, he'll be tired from <br/>
traveling and need to rest up in this Letterbox.<br/>
<br/>
The Clueless Dawg is known to be partial to Fishes and Planets in our <br/>
Solar System, but would be tickled pink to see more of the world.<br/>
<br/>
Please let the Clueless Dawg's buddy, Lightning Bug, know that you <br/>
have enjoyed his company and where he accompanied you.<br/>
