<div>Ace Detective Claire de Lune, young, diminutive, and smart, beat out all others to solve the Clue Exchange Game mystery.  </div>
<div> </div>
<div>NEWS FLASH:  Miss Scarlet Did It in the Kitchen with the Knife!  </div>
<div> </div>
<div>(Not to be confused with MizScarlet...)</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Claire collected all 20 clue stamps from all the other detective attendees and deduced from her list who, what, and where, was missing.  She remained undaunted by the surprise suspect, Cruella DeVille, and the uncommon weapon, poison.  </div>
<div> </div>
<div>All this despite the dastardly doings of the local humorless constabulary who decided to escort this obviously dangerous group of mystery makers off of the premises.  (News at 11!  And don't believe all those rumors you are about to hear from others.)  Fortunately the Cluesters reconvened in more convial circumstances, occupying a cozy corner of Chevy's Mex in Ballston.  (So that's what that rebus and other stuff meant.)  Margaritas cure all embarassment and many impressions exchanged.  </div>
<div> </div>
<div>Claire wins a copy of the Clue board game, stamped inside with all of the days Clues.  </div>
<div> </div>
<div>Thanks to all who came, humble apologies to those late arrivals who missed us, and special thanks to all the carvers.  Glad to see those from out of town.  (Now you have stories to take back.)</div>
<div> </div>
<div>This was a mystery gather that was more mysterious and more exciting than I'd rather.</div>
