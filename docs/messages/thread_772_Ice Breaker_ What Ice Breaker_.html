I've never been inside Pentagon City before, so I thought I was in <br/>
the wrong place or that the event ended much earlier then expected. <br/>
I got there around 2:00PM and thought for sure I would still see <br/>
signs or banners and you guys would be easy to spot (even for us <br/>

                    <div id="ygrps-yiv-44263146"><div>Ha! If only we had gotten that far! A severe storm had blown through and the stage had no power. They wouldn't let the lawn seat people buy tickets (bloody peasants!) as they said they had no power to work the ticket machine. Meanwhile, I see a STACK of lawnseat tickets at the window and tell them to sell them to us. They said they can't because they couldn't tell us which section we were in. To which I respond "They're LAWN seats! There is no section!" Plus they said the lights were on on the stage but the sound system was not so they have no amps/speakers, etc. To which I replied "Somehow, Beethoven was able to conduct this piece and the orchestra managed to play it without electricity. Whaddya say we give it a try". The whole time I was being egged on by this guy behind me. Harris, my husband, was leaning against a wall smoking a cigarette with the guys wife. She say's to him "Your wife's a real pistol, huh?" and he say's "You sure see her after a few beers! Please ask your
 husband to stop egging her on. She really doesn't need any encouragement!" Then this big honkin' manager threatbes to call the cops on all of us rabble rousers if we don't calm down. To which we replied "Bring 'em on!" I could just see the newspaper headlines "Hordes of vicious middle aged Beethoven Fan's arrested at the Mann" One fan's mother quoted as saying "I knew when she started listening to that "long haired" music all was lost! I begged her to stick to the Grateful Dead and Pink Floyd but she just wouldn't listen!"</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Anyway, they couldn't restore power in time and everyone was sent home. But what and adventure!<br/><br/><b><i>Peggy Wink &lt;peggyannewink@...&gt;</i></b> wrote:</div>

<div>Ha! If only we had gotten that far! A severe storm had blown through and the stage had no power. They wouldn't let the lawn seat people buy tickets (bloody peasants!) as they said they had no power to work the ticket machine. Meanwhile, I see a STACK of lawnseat tickets at the window and tell them to sell them to us. They said they can't because they couldn't tell us which section we were in. To which I respond "They're LAWN seats! There is no section!" Plus they said the lights were on on the stage but the sound system was not so they have no amps/speakers, etc. To which I replied "Somehow, Beethoven was able to conduct this piece and the orchestra managed to play it without electricity. Whaddya say we give it a try". The whole time I was being egged on by this guy behind me. Harris, my husband, was leaning against a wall smoking a cigarette with the guys wife. She say's to him "Your wife's a real pistol, huh?" and he say's "You sure see her after a few beers! Please ask your
 husband to stop egging her on. She really doesn't need any encouragement!" Then this big honkin' manager threatbes to call the cops on all of us rabble rousers if we don't calm down. To which we replied "Bring 'em on!" I could just see the newspaper headlines "Hordes of vicious middle aged Beethoven Fan's arrested at the Mann" One fan's mother quoted as saying "I knew when she started listening to that "long haired" music all was lost! I begged her to stick to the Grateful Dead and Pink Floyd but she just wouldn't listen!"</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Anyway, they couldn't restore power in time and everyone was sent home. But what and adventure!<br/><br/><b><i>Peggy Wink &lt;peggyannewink@...&gt;</i></b> wrote:</div>
