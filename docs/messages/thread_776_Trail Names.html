ago I DID have a bum nearly as wide as a snow shovel ;)  Now, thanks to <br/>
hiking and having a job that keeps me outdoors most of the time, my snow <br/>
shovel bum has shrunk, but I'll never be the 100lb "Slats" that I used <br/>
to be.  Oh well...<br/>
<br/>
I'm so excited because today I carved my first stamp!  It's my Shovelbum <br/>
stamp and it isn't too bad, if I do say so myself.  I discovered that I <br/>
really enjoy carving.  Haven't come up with a stamp for the KniseGuys <br/>
yet...any suggestions?<br/>
