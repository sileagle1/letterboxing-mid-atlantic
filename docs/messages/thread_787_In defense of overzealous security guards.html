                    <div id="ygrps-yiv-2113388974">OK, I know many of you are pretty upset at the mall for kicking us out on Saturday, but I am not.  Sure, I wasn't happy about the sudden change of plans, but WE were the ones in the wrong there.  <br/>
<br/>
The mall is private property, and as such we are there at the pleasure of the mall's management.  The security guards were just doing their jobs.  <br/>
<br/>
Also, it was not like the place was empty.  I don't know about anyone else, but I took a look around and saw that most every other table was filled, and as soon as we had gotten up, people were taking our table.<br/>
<br/>
The mall is there for one reason, and that is to make money.  They are not making money if we are taking up their tables for three hours, even if we do have food on the tables.  That is something that has to be accepted, even thought the mall is a public place, it does not mean they cannot remove people from it for just about any reason.<br/>
<br/>
We went about the gathering all wrong.  It should have been set up ahead of time.  Arrangements with the mall should have been made.<br/>
<br/>
In the end, I think it all worked out for the better.  Chevy's was great, their staff was wonderful, and it was a better, more private, intimate setting.<br/>

<p>Hmm, a series based on Filch comes to mind... Hmmm, Hall Monitor, Filch, Mall Guy, and J. Edgar Hoover.  Useful civil servants, all, with the same occupational hazard character flaws.  </p>
