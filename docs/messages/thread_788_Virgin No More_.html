my home.  I used to walk through that park every couple of weekend <br/>
and I figured what the hay.  It was so much fun a monster was born.<br/>
<br/>
Funny thing is that the Little Lehigh Creek runs through this park <br/>
and that day was the first day of fishing season (4/17/04).  Needless <br/>
to say, the park was busy, so I am not sure that I was discreet.  The <br/>
boxes were all up in the woods a bit, so I may not have been <br/>
noticed.  I took my son about a month later to refind the boxes and <br/>
he got hooked!<br/>

<br/>
I had read about it alot - and had even seen some pictures of people doing it in <br/>
magazines.<br/>
(Smithsonian April 1998 - Ooo La-la!)<br/>
<br/>
It started out okay.  There was all that weird excitement and nervous energy at first.<br/>
<br/>
But then it was kind of confusing: Where to get it?  Where to put it?  What to do with it?<br/>
<br/>
And finally it was just humiliating:  Are you okay?  Was it fun for you?  Wanna try it again?<br/>
<br/>
But like so many things that begin that way, you keep doing it and it gets better.  And <br/>
soon, you can't get enough of it and you do it all the time.<br/>
<br/>
And if you're not careful you get... poison ivy.</div>

thing was that there was this couple we didn't seem to be able to <br/>
get rid of as soon as we approached the place where we were supposed <br/>
to look at the side of the path. So we kept stopping and blowing our <br/>
nose, so they had to pass us. Then they stopped and cleaned their <br/>
shoes, so we needed to pass them. Then we stopped and scratched our <br/>
heads and they needed to pass .... :) .... get the picture?<br/>
This kept going for a while until they and we looked at each other <br/>
in complete exasperation. And then in recognition ;)) The lady just <br/>
said "letterboxing?" and it turned out that we had run into the <br/>
placers who where on a maintenance trip!<br/>
They let us look, though, but inexpereinced as we were, the kids <br/>
always ran too far into the woods and I could always see the <br/>
placers' bewilderment and kept calling the kids back. Finally we <br/>
found it and Alan (the placer) even helped us to get it out from <br/>
under the ice and rock as we were not able to move it at all. It was <br/>
a fun experience and so nice to meet people who were already into it <br/>
and could point us to other interesting boxes in the area.<br/>
But we still get hilarious when we box and start coughing and <br/>
scratching and blowing noses when we get closer to the hiding spot, <br/>
just in memory of our first trip.<br/>

the box. I couldn't believe it would actually be there - I thought<br/>
we'd never be able to find some tiny box hidden out in the woods! But<br/>
sure enough - we did a dance when the box was right where it was<br/>
supposed to be - and we were immediately hooked. Ironically, we also<br/>
tried to get the Paintworks later on that same day, and failed! Tee<br/>
hee! Found the mystery box, but couldn't find the easy one! (Gwenllian<br/>
and I went out a few weeks later and had success.)That evening, to<br/>
celebrate our first find, we went out for chinese food, and our<br/>
fortunes that evening became part of our first plant, a hitchhiker<br/>

<div><font face="Arial" size="2">The Bandits' first trip was to a 2 box series which 
has since been pulled by the National fun-Police Service... The day started out 
on the chilly side, as it was late March in the Hudson Valley, where May flowers 
sometime don't show up until June.  No sooner than we hit the trail, the 
sky clouded over and the gentle breeze off the Hduson turned into gale force 
winds.  Not to be deterred, we pressed on and in the freezing drizzle found 
our very first box.... decided it was too cold and would withstand the delayed 
gratification of box #2 another day.</font></div>

<div><font face="Arial" size="2">We've been back to Vanderbilt Mansion many times 
and always marvel at how short the walk to the site of the first box really 
was.  Now that we are experienced boxers, we would probably cut 40 
minutes off that box!</font></div>

<br/>
That's the way it is with my parents - they only box when I visit <br/>
them in RI, but they're SO happy when they do because we've <br/>
discovered the loveliest places that my mom ends up revisiting time <br/>
and again (they've only lived in RI for a couple of years). I might <br/>
start sending them clues, though, for a must-see to try to get them a <br/>
bit more active in 'boxing.<br/>

<p>HEAR YE! HEAR YE! HEAR YE!</p>
<p>On this Groundhog Day, February 2nd, the year 2005 on Gobbler's Knob, Punxsutawney, Pennsylvania, Punxsutawney Phil, King of the Groundhogs, Father of all Marmota, Seer of Seers, Prognosticator of Prognosticators has been summoned by Groundhog President William Cooper. Phil gleefully exited his burrow at 7:31 a.m. to be greeted by his longtime friend and handler, Bill Deeley, who held him high so he could greet the large throng of Faithful Followers. He wished them all a "Happy Groundhog Day." Bill placed him atop the old oak stump where he surveyed his surroundings. He then turned to President William and in Groundhogese directed him to the scroll which reads:</p>
<p>Natural disasters have been a terrible thing; tsunamis,<br/>downpours, floods, landslides, heavy snowstorms, avalanches,<br/>frigid temperatures, sleet and freezing rain.<br/>They all cause much destruction, suffering and pain.</p>
<p>When it seems like too much with which to cope;<br/>The coming of spring brings us new hope.<br/>Changing seasons is a wonderful thing.</p>
<p>Now it's Groundhog Day and we think of spring.<br/>Will Spring come early or will it come late?</p>
<p>It's time for me to prognosticate.<br/>As I study the sun<br/>It's all about fun.<br/>But I'm sorry to say<br/>I see my shadow today.<br/>When my shadow I see,<br/>Six more weeks of winter there will be!</p>

hindsight, they're funny of course.)   <br/>
<br/>
This past summer I took Bo Peep with me and we hid our class field <br/>
trip box series at CH state park, and on one of the trails we <br/>
noticed a beware of ticks and the general lymes disease notice park <br/>
sign.  well , we had sprayed real good before our adventure so we <br/>
kept going.  writing all our clues as we go we finally have all in <br/>
rhyme and the perfect location to place (and the clue rhymes)  I <br/>
take the box get ahead of her about 5 steps and she says Jess I <br/>
don't think we should hide it here, I see an awful lot of ticks..   <br/>
Well i see 1 or 2 i say, as i turn around,  there she stands in the <br/>
middle of the trail, in broad daylight with her jeans down around <br/>
her ankles, standing there in her pink undies.   I say what are you <br/>
doing, b/c this is a running trail, and not all that secluded.  she <br/>
had about 15 ticks on her you know the teeny, tiny variety, the <br/>
dreaded deer tick.    I laughed so hard seeing her drop her drawers <br/>
in broad daylight,    but you know for being in the same spot as her <br/>
I only had 2 ticks on me,  when she got home her hubby took about 20 <br/>
more off of her back and mid area.   (a not so funny- funny moment <br/>
we will always remember.      JC slowerlowerletterboxer<br/>

 You are SOOOOO funny....  The crab was lovely, &amp; it'd have been ok <br/>
if there had been only one mite too.  But to get home at 11PM and <br/>
discover dozens of microscopic creepy-crawlies on my legs, arms &amp; <br/>
back--I went into instant hysteria.  Especially after I showered and <br/>
they were still there.  Then my husband decided to spray me down <br/>
with Deep Woods Off--so now I'm being coated with VERY COLD aerosol--<br/>
choking from the fumes and wondering if I will catch some horrible <br/>
disease from the parasites or die of asphyxiation first....  Good <br/>
