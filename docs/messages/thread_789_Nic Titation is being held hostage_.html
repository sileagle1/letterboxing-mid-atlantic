plans of those menacing Red Hatters.  She got a little too close and <br/>
now she is missing.  Rumor has it she is being held hostage by some <br/>
joker - goes by the name of Wink, Peggyanne Wink. Thinks she is some <br/>
kind of a comedian or something. Nic needs help and needs help bad.   <br/>
Can you help set Nic free?  Can Nic hitch a ride with you to the next <br/>
safe letterboxer on your route?  She needs our protection - we can't <br/>
just leave her in any old letterbox.  She needs to be handed off in <br/>
person to the next letterboxer.  If she gets stuck in a letterbox she <br/>
will not be free to foil the plans of evil letterboxers.  If you are <br/>
up for the challenge you will find this joker Peggyanne Wink in Media <br/>
this weekend.  Word on the street is that she is going to be hanging <br/>
out at Aaron's Comedy Cafe above the Central Park Restaurant in Media <br/>
this Saturday night.  Tell the joker Winky sent ya and offer to <br/>
exchange stamps with her.  She keeps Nic in the same bag as her <br/>
stamp.  Get Nic out of there while the joker is busy stamping her <br/>
book.  <br/>
