Has this happened to you? Used to be you could go somewhere and say, <br/>
simply, "What a great place." Then the LB bug bit. Now you go, and <br/>
say "Nice place... for a letterbox," and the next thing you know the <br/>
stamp is finished and you're trying to think of a good angle from <br/>
which to approach clue-writing. Soon you have yet another box out in <br/>
the wild to worry and fuss over. I'll have to limit myself to going <br/>
to places that already have boxes to increase the F count and reduce <br/>
stress.<br/>
Aud<br/>
P.S. And yes, that means there's a fresh stamp here related to a <br/>
really neat place (...for a letterbox) in NJ. Stay tuned...</div>
