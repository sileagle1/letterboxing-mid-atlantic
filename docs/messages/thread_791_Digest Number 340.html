My first (our first) was Puppy Prints in Fischer's Park near Lansdale PA.<br/>
It was 95 degrees.  I dragged my whole family along.<br/>
We waded back into a big bunch of briars and finally found the box.<br/>
Only I didn't have a logbook or a stamp yet.<br/>
Didn't realize you needed those.<br/>
We went back a few days later with the proper equipment and logged our first.<br/>

&gt; Subject: In defense of overzealous security guards<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; OK, I know many of you are pretty upset at the mall for kicking us out on <br/>
&gt; Saturday, but I am not.  Sure, I wasn't happy about the sudden change of plans, <br/>
&gt; but WE were the ones in the wrong there.  <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; The mall is private property, and as such we are there at the pleasure of the <br/>
&gt; mall's management.  The security guards were just doing their jobs.  <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Also, it was not like the place was empty.  I don't know about anyone else, but <br/>
&gt; I took a look around and saw that most every other table was filled, and as soon <br/>
&gt; as we had gotten up, people were taking our table.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; The mall is there for one reason, and that is to make money.  They are not <br/>
&gt; making money if we are taking up their tables for three hours, even if we do <br/>
&gt; have food on the tables.  That is something that has to be accepted, even <br/>
&gt; thought the mall is a public place, it does not mean they cannot remove people <br/>
&gt; from it for just about any reason.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; We went about the gathering all wrong.  It should have been set up ahead of <br/>
&gt; time.  Arrangements with the mall should have been made.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; In the end, I think it all worked out for the better.  Chevy's was great, their <br/>
&gt; staff was wonderful, and it was a better, more private, intimate setting.<br/>

&gt; My first time was in Marble Falls, Texas. The box that was supposed to be there <br/>
&gt; was missing, but one of Silent Doug's HH was there on it's own, and when I found <br/>
&gt; out he was *famous*, I was soooooooo excited!<br/>

&gt; Brianne is pretty biker chick tough looking with those faux tribal <br/>

&gt; <br/>
&gt; Riddle me this, why are the only ones looking for love in these ads <br/>
&gt; obvious lonely ladies that are very high on the baywatch scale?  Why <br/>
&gt; no lonely men that are very high on the baywatch scale?<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Is Kyle looking for love as desperately as Brianne?  Can Dolph find <br/>
&gt; the happiness that Jabu seeks?<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Where is the equality?  Or do the ladies' browsers have the aptly <br/>
&gt; digitally enhanced dudes?<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Perplexed,<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; LB<br/>
&gt; Perfectly happy with Mrs. LB, who makes any of these lonely ladies <br/>
&gt; resemble slatterns.<br/>

&gt; My first was the "Fish in Outer Space Series" just a quick walk from <br/>
&gt; my home.  I used to walk through that park every couple of weekend <br/>
&gt; and I figured what the hay.  It was so much fun a monster was born.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Funny thing is that the Little Lehigh Creek runs through this park <br/>
&gt; and that day was the first day of fishing season (4/17/04).  Needless <br/>
&gt; to say, the park was busy, so I am not sure that I was discreet.  The <br/>
&gt; boxes were all up in the woods a bit, so I may not have been <br/>
&gt; noticed.  I took my son about a month later to refind the boxes and <br/>
&gt; he got hooked!<br/>

&gt; Our first box was a Silent Doug box as well...the Panther Swamp last summer.  <br/>
&gt; Some of them it is really hard to be discrete with especially during the summer <br/>
&gt; when the trails are more crowded.  However some of them are in the middle of no <br/>
&gt; where with no one else around, so being discrete is no problem.<br/>

&gt; <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Apparently Nic Titation was right on the brim of foiling the evil <br/>
&gt; plans of those menacing Red Hatters.  She got a little too close and <br/>
&gt; now she is missing.  Rumor has it she is being held hostage by some <br/>
&gt; joker - goes by the name of Wink, Peggyanne Wink. Thinks she is some <br/>
&gt; kind of a comedian or something. Nic needs help and needs help bad.   <br/>
&gt; Can you help set Nic free?  Can Nic hitch a ride with you to the next <br/>
&gt; safe letterboxer on your route?  She needs our protection - we can't <br/>
&gt; just leave her in any old letterbox.  She needs to be handed off in <br/>
&gt; person to the next letterboxer.  If she gets stuck in a letterbox she <br/>
&gt; will not be free to foil the plans of evil letterboxers.  If you are <br/>
&gt; up for the challenge you will find this joker Peggyanne Wink in Media <br/>
&gt; this weekend.  Word on the street is that she is going to be hanging <br/>
&gt; out at Aaron's Comedy Cafe above the Central Park Restaurant in Media <br/>
&gt; this Saturday night.  Tell the joker Winky sent ya and offer to <br/>
&gt; exchange stamps with her.  She keeps Nic in the same bag as her <br/>
&gt; stamp.  Get Nic out of there while the joker is busy stamping her <br/>
&gt; book.  <br/>

&gt; kicking us out on Saturday, but I am not.  Sure, I wasn't happy about the sudden <br/>
&gt; change of plans, but WE were the ones in the wrong there.  <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; The mall is private property, and as such we are there at the pleasure of the <br/>
&gt; mall's management.  The security guards were just doing their jobs.  <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Also, it was not like the place was empty.  I don't know about anyone else, but <br/>
&gt; I took a look around and saw that most every other table was filled, and as soon <br/>
&gt; as we had gotten up, people were taking our table.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; The mall is there for one reason, and that is to make money.  They are not <br/>
&gt; making money if we are taking up their tables for three hours, even if we do <br/>
&gt; have food on the tables.  That is something that has to be accepted, even <br/>
&gt; thought the mall is a public place, it does not mean they cannot remove people <br/>
&gt; from it for just about any reason.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; We went about the gathering all wrong.  It should have been set up ahead of <br/>
&gt; time.  Arrangements with the mall should have been made.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; In the end, I think it all worked out for the better.  Chevy's was great, their <br/>
&gt; staff was wonderful, and it was a better, more private, intimate setting.<br/>

&gt; All right I had to get the log book out to figure out where my first <br/>

&gt; Okay, I'm really hooked now!  I found my first letterbox today.  It <br/>
&gt; was <br/>
&gt; &gt; Go Fly a Kite in York Co., PA.  I don't know how you guys manage <br/>
&gt; to <br/>
&gt; &gt; stamp discreetly.  All I can say is I'm glad its winter and no one <br/>
&gt; else <br/>
&gt; &gt; was in the park because it seemed to take me FOREVER to sign in <br/>
&gt; and <br/>
&gt; &gt; stamp and clean up and rehide.  :)  Hey, does everyone remember <br/>
&gt; their <br/>

&gt; My first was an attempt at the 3 box series Pennypack Park by Joseph.  I<br/>
&gt; found one of three the first day, went back and reread how to use the<br/>
&gt; compass, and returned for the other 2.  It has been down hill from there.<br/>

&gt; Yeah, yeah.  We know.  We're just trying to make the best of it and have some <br/>
&gt; fun.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Hmm, a series based on Filch comes to mind... Hmmm, Hall Monitor, Filch, Mall <br/>
&gt; Guy, and J. Edgar Hoover.  Useful civil servants, all, with the same <br/>
&gt; occupational hazard character flaws.  <br/>

&gt; My first time was painful, embarrassing and messy.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I had read about it alot - and had even seen some pictures of people doing it in <br/>
&gt; magazines.<br/>
&gt; (Smithsonian April 1998 - Ooo La-la!)<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; It started out okay.  There was all that weird excitement and nervous energy at <br/>
&gt; first.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; But then it was kind of confusing: Where to get it?  Where to put it?  What to <br/>
&gt; do with it?<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; And finally it was just humiliating:  Are you okay?  Was it fun for you?  Wanna <br/>
&gt; try it again?<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; But like so many things that begin that way, you keep doing it and it gets <br/>
&gt; better.  And <br/>
&gt; soon, you can't get enough of it and you do it all the time.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; And if you're not careful you get... poison ivy.<br/>
