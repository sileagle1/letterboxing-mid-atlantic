the left hand side. A certain LBNA member who shall remain nameless <br/>
(but who has a glowing behind) asked for this feature eons ago, and I <br/>
just never did it. I finally remembered today and had a spare 3 <br/>
minutes, so I put it up. Please take a gander and use it at your <br/>
discretion.<br/>
<br/>
Please note: It is only for boxes that are officially MIA, or at <br/>
least confirmed by more than 2 people (and hopefully the placer) that <br/>
it is gone. It is not because you could not find XYZ box buried under <br/>
2 feet of snow, so there's no way it could possibly be there! Please <br/>
be responsible with it or I will be forced to take it down.<br/>

Also, please note, the layout and wording were shamelessly stolen <br/>
from the LBSE group :)<br/>
