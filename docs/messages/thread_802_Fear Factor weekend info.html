<div>Well, I'm afraid I'm a little too old and chubby to do any stunts . . . but certainly am up for camping, swimming, and boxing. Maybe we could do some group carving also. I'm willing to bring materials if someone wants to give lessons.Bet between us we could get a lot carved . . . maybe some planted too?</div>
