first hitchhikers -- Batman and Superman.  Both placed on 2-6-05.  We<br/>
want to see who moves most frequently and who gets the furthest!  It's<br/>
a race.  Help us out!!<br/>
<br/>
In the process of placing the HH's we picked up three more finds. <br/>
Won't name the boxes to preseve the mystery of where the Superheroes<br/>
lurk, but we didn't travel too far from home -- there's lots of new<br/>
boxes springing up in the area these days!  How exciting, bring 'em on!!<br/>
<br/>
With nice warm temps we could shed our coats -- yet still slip a bit<br/>
in the snow.  What a nice day for boxing.  I'd be happy with a few<br/>
more of these kinds of days -- but I'll also take one more big<br/>
sledding snow.<br/>
