<div>I am pleased to report that I was first finder on the Vynecrest letterbox near Breinigsville, PA yesterday.  I gave everyone a week to get there, but was in the area for lunch and had to check it out.  Nice little winery. Of course I bought 2 bottles.   </div>

<div>Rich,</div>
<div>On the subject of pinewood derby: our girls had theirs last weekend.</div>
<div>Out of 62 entries, we managed 3rd and 5th overall.</div>
<div>Not a bad showing if I may say so.  When is your race?</div>

                    <div id="ygrps-yiv-2004583214">Glad you enjoyed the Letterbox and the Winery!  I would expect no <br/>
less than a first find from Tim the Raindear for an Allentown area <br/>
box!  Cyclonic had a chance, but we got too busy gabbing, plotting <br/>
and scheming on Sunday and I think I held him up!<br/>
<br/>
Our PWD is on the 27th, and my guys are pretty psyched.  Congrats on <br/>
a fine finish, as it sounds liek you have defeated friction quite <br/>
well!  Last year we had similar success to you, finishing 2nd and 4th <br/>
in the pack.<br/>
<br/>
Tonight we begin painting and tomorrow is boxing day in a mysterious <br/>
location.<br/>
