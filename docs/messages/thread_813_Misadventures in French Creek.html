<br/>
The Visigoths Return!  The Snow has melted enough to allow for new <br/>
Mapsurfian Mischief.<br/>
<br/>
Jan, Cyclonic and I were joined by Karl and Sandy from Jenkintown to <br/>
explore the wonderful world of French Creek State Park.  We were able <br/>
to find a couple more Mapsurfer boxes, including Six Penny Diary and <br/>
an undisclosed box in an undisclosed location.  We were unsuccessful <br/>
in a second undisclosed box.  Karl and Sandy are veteran letterboxers <br/>
that had found the couple we were able to track down several years <br/>
ago.  We have extended them an invite to the Road Rally.<br/>
<br/>
Stay tuned for the next Hairy Legged Adventure...including the future <br/>
home of Beldin...<br/>
