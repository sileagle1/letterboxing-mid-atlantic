2005.<br/>
<br/>
Place: Black Hill Regional Park, 20930 Lake Ridge Dr., Boyds, MD<br/>
Time: 11 a.m. until ?<br/>
<br/>
Camping is available nearby at Little Bennett Regional Park.<br/>
Furry friends on leashes are welcome!<br/>
<br/>
The park, including lake, is 1,843 wooded acres. Little Seneca Lake <br/>
is 505 acres, with 15.7 miles of shoreline, great for fishing. <br/>
Rowboats, canoes and kayaks are available to rent. There is also a <br/>
nice nature center.<br/>
<br/>
There are over 3 miles of paved trails and 10 miles of unpaved <br/>
trails accessible to hikers, mountain bikers and horseback riders. <br/>
There are currently 19 listed letterboxes hidden in the park and <br/>
many more within a short driving distance.<br/>
<br/>
I have reserved a large pavilion with restrooms, playground, many <br/>
tables and grills. Charcoal fires and hotdogs will be provided (or <br/>
you may bring something to throw on a grill). Attendees are asked to <br/>
bring a potluck dish to share. There is a volleyball court and <br/>
horseshoe pit if letterboxing isn't enough for you (BYO).<br/>
<br/>
We are planning to keep this a casual meet-and-greet with <br/>
intermittent letterboxing frenzy, but are open to suggestions. I <br/>
will need a rough headcount, so please email me if you plan to <br/>
attend or if I can answer any questions.<br/>
<br/>
Hope to see many letterboxing friends: old and new, from near and <br/>
far!!<br/>

Isn't that where those three student filmmakers were lost while <br/>

Sounds very nice... Thank you for organizing.<br/>

about 5 miles away, in Seneca Creek State Park. But there is a <br/>
letterbox in Black Hill Park called "The Blair Letterboxing <br/>

Look forward to seeing you in May.<br/>
