<p style="PADDING-RIGHT:0px;PADDING-LEFT:10px;PADDING-BOTTOM:0px;PADDING-TOP:0px;">People came from near and far. We had local Marylanders, some from Virginia, and even visitors from New England. The presentation to the winner of the 1st Clue Exchange Game was made to ace detective Claire de Lune. People exchanged and enjoyed the event stamp, many PLB images (even if they couldn't stamp in the logs), and many hitchhikers. Before and afterwards, was much local boxing. One out of town guest from RI had sprained her ankle and was driven on the "Driveby Bye Bye" series which she much enjoyed. She sat propped up in the car and pointed out the window, "No, that other tree." "I've done night boxing and mystery boxing but I never carboxed before," she remarked. After the gather the new Bird House series in Black Hills Park proved to be gorgeous and fun.  Cupid was found a day before the big day.  First finders, Woohoo!<br/>Until the next gather, "Happy hunting out there."</p>

<p style="PADDING-RIGHT:0px;PADDING-LEFT:10px;PADDING-BOTTOM:0px;PADDING-TOP:0px;">P.S.  The event stamp is posted on AQ in case anyone wishes to log in. </p></div></div><p>
