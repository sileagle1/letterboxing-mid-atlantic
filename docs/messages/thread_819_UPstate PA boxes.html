Hi All,<br/>
<br/>
Winky and  I will be in the middle of the state this weekend around the<br/>
Williamsport / Danville area.  Northumberland County ish.  I know there are<br/>
2 boxes in Ashland but does anyone know of any other boxes up in that neck<br/>
of the woods.  We have all day Friday and a nice chunk of Saturday so we can<br/>
probably travel in a 30 mile radius of that area.  We want to fill the days<br/>
with boxing so any help will surely be appreciated.<br/>
<br/>
I tried Atlasquest and only got the 2 in Ashland.  I am unfamiliar with all<br/>
the city and twsp names so LBNA site is not really helping.</div>
