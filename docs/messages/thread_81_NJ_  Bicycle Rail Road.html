to look for it a couple of weeks ago but forgot the clue sheet and <br/>
wasn't sure that I had the right place. I went back yesterday and <br/>
really beat the bushes, well, actually the clue stated that it was in <br/>
tree roots but I looked all over the place. No Rubbermaid or zippy <br/>
bags or wet log book to be found. I contacted the owner. It's not on <br/>
the mail site yet. If I don't see anything in a couple of days should <br/>
I post to LBNA?</div>
