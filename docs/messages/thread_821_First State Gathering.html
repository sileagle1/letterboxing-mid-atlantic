                    <div id="ygrps-yiv-882865212">i will attempt to organize this event (with help of course). i <br/>
suggest Cape Henlopen State Park located in Lewes, DE mainly due to <br/>
the target rich environment. group camping is available ($1 per <br/>
person). i will need to have an estimate of attendees so i can <br/>
reserve the group camping site. this is primative camping: tent only. <br/>
they also have public camp grounds, however, you will be responsible <br/>
for booking and reserving your own site. also, they have a pavillion <br/>
for free (first come basis) which is located in the park.<br/>
<br/>
i also suggest one of two weekends in May. mainly because it will fit <br/>
into my schedule, crowds will be less and the weather starting to get <br/>
nice. if you are interested in attending this event you MUST let me <br/>
know via email so I can start formulate plans and a roster. i will <br/>
send out an evite to everyone who responds.<br/>
<br/>
here is your chance to enjoy a Spring weekend camping, letterboxing, <br/>
meeting fellow boxers, campfires, samores, ghost stories, etc.... <br/>
you get the idea.</div>
