Mother, now grandmother. My box for my grandchild would be "The <br/>
second Time Around". I doesn't quite fit but when you think about it, <br/>
we really do fall in love with babies.<br/>
<br/>
Brook Benton Lyrics <br/>
The Second Time Around <br/>
Words and Music by Cahn and van Heusen<br/>
<br/>
Love is lovelier, the second time around<br/>
Just as wonderful, with both feet on the ground<br/>
It's that second time you hear your love song sung<br/>
Makes you think perhaps that love, like youth, is wasted on the young<br/>
Love's more comfortable the second time you fall<br/>
Like a friendly home the second time you call<br/>
Who can say, what brought us to this miracle we've found<br/>
There are those who'd bet<br/>
Love comes but once - and yet<br/>
I'm oh so glad we met<br/>
The second time around<br/>
<br/>
Gillian<br/>

<div>Oh Jan that's WONDERFUL news!! I am so glad Laura and the baby are doing 
well. Is she mobile yet or is her ankle still recovering from the break? So 
great and I am so jealous! I am ready to be a grandmom too but my son's are not 
cooperating!Congrats again,</div>

  everyone who has been suffering through my endless chatter about<br/>the little 
  grandson that was due on April 1, that chatter is over<br/>because little 
  Nicholas made his appearance this afternoon.  I am so<br/>excited and so 
  relieved that both my daughter and her new son are<br/>doing very well.  
  Tomorrow they will allow me to see him - it is so<br/>hard not to go running 
  down there tonight yet but they told me that<br/>they won't let me in so I 
  guess I just have to wait.  One of my jobs<br/>as a good grandmother will 
  be to make sure that he knows how to letterbox!<br/><br/>Jan of Team Little
