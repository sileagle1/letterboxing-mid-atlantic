New letterbox: Persistence of Winky<br/>
Philadelphia, Philadelphia County, PA<br/>
Placed by: Winky<br/>
Box webpage located at: <br/>
<br/>
Clues:<br/>
 The Philadelphia Museum of Art has the great privilege to host the only<br/>
U.S. showing of the Salvador Dalm exhibition. Over 200 of Dalms works will<br/>
be on display from February 16th through May 15th, many of which have never<br/>
been shown in the United States.  Commemorate this event as only a<br/>
letterboxer can and come find the Persistence of Winky. <br/>
<br/>
Your search starts in the Azalea Garden in Fairmount Park.  Find the Pergola<br/>
on the East Side of the circular parking lot and stand in the circle in the<br/>
center between the two benches.  (No real reason for this other than the<br/>
face that it exists!)  Face the fountain and head up the sidewalk South<br/>
East.  <br/>
<br/>
Do you see the place where Bob the Builder hangs out?  Take the paved path<br/>
that runs past his hangout.  Along the path you will pass some brave and<br/>
surly characters.  Don't listen to Friedrich - he will point you in the<br/>
wrong direction.  John Paul appears to be looking for this letterbox too and<br/>
Casimir will be happy to keep an eye on your car.<br/>
<br/>
After you pass Casimir you will see the Welterweight Steps.  (See if you can<br/>
resist the urge to practice your Rocky impression here)  At the top of the<br/>
steps, find the Mariner and Merchant.  Facing this, look for the Gazebo not<br/>
to far in the distance.  Shame the eagle didn't want to hang out on this<br/>
one.  <br/>
<br/>
Head up to the Gazebo and admire the view of the Schuylkill River.  When you<br/>
are finished taking in the view, turn back around and find Mona Schneidman's<br/>
bench.  Looks like a pretty good place to sit down and stamp, huh?  Good<br/>
thing you are so close now.  Standing at Mona's right arm - take 8 steps to<br/>
the two trunked tree.  Look deep into the Yucca to find your treasure.<br/>
<br/>
Please take care in removing and replacing the box as this is a pretty well<br/>
travelled area.<br/>
<br/>
While you are there, go check out Salvador Dalm.  Like this letterbox, he<br/>
will be here only a short while.  This letterbox will only be available for<br/>
the duration of the Dalm exhibition.<br/>
<br/>
Please shoot me an email and let me know how the box is holding up.<br/>
<br/>
Happy Letterboxing!<br/>
<br/>

 Over 200 of Dalms <br/>works will<br/>&gt; be on display from February 16th through May 15th, many of which <br/>have never<br/>&gt; been shown in the United States.  Commemorate this event as only a<br/>&gt; letterboxer can and come find the Persistence of Winky. <br/>&gt; <br/>&gt; Your search starts in the Azalea Garden in Fairmount Park.  Find <br/>the Pergola<br/>&gt; on the East Side of the circular parking lot and stand in the <br/>circle in the<br/>&gt; center between the two benches.  (No real reason for this other <br/>than the<br/>&gt; face that it exists!)  Face the fountain and head up the sidewalk <br/>South<br/>&gt; East.  <br/>&gt; <br/>&gt; Do you see the place where Bob the Builder hangs out?  Take the <br/>paved path<br/>&gt; that runs past his hangout.  Along the path you will pass some <br/>brave and<br/>&gt; surly characters.  Don't listen to Friedrich - he will point you in <br/>the<br/>&gt; wrong direction.  John Paul appears to be
 looking for this <br/>letterbox too and<br/>&gt; Casimir will be happy to keep an eye on your car.<br/>&gt; <br/>&gt; After you pass Casimir you will see the Welterweight Steps.  (See <br/>if you can<br/>&gt; resist the urge to practice your Rocky impression here)  At the top <br/>of the<br/>&gt; steps, find the Mariner and Merchant.  Facing this, look for the <br/>Gazebo not<br/>&gt; to far in the distance.  Shame the eagle didn't want to hang out on <br/>this<br/>&gt; one.  <br/>&gt; <br/>&gt; Head up to the Gazebo and admire the view of the Schuylkill River.  <br/>When you<br/>&gt; are finished taking in the view, turn back around and find Mona <br/>Schneidman's<br/>&gt; bench.  Looks like a pretty good place to sit down and stamp, huh?  <br/>Good<br/>&gt; thing you are so close now.  Standing at Mona's right arm - take 8 <br/>steps to<br/>&gt; the two trunked tree.  Look deep into the Yucca to find your <br/>treasure.<br/>&gt; <br/>&gt; Please take care
 in removing and replacing the box as this is a <br/>pretty well<br/>&gt; travelled area.<br/>&gt; <br/>&gt; While you are there, go check out Salvador Dalm.  Like this <br/>letterbox, he<br/>&gt; will be here only a short while.  This letterbox will only be <br/>available for<br/>&gt; the duration of the Dalm exhibition.<br/>&gt; <br/>&gt; Please shoot me an email and let me know how the box is holding up.<br/>&gt; <br/>&gt; Happy Letterboxing!<br/>&gt; <br/>&gt; Winky<br/>&gt; <br/>&gt; <br/>&gt; "I believe that the moment is near when, by a procedure of active <br/>paranoic<br/>&gt; thought, it will be possible to systematize confusion and <br/>contribute to the<br/>&gt; total discrediting of the world of reality."<br/>&gt; <br/>&gt; - Salvador Dalm<br/>&gt; <br/>&gt; <br/>&gt; This is an automated email for the box-announce list.<br/>&gt; <br/>&gt; letterboxing.org<br/>&gt; <br/>&gt; <br/>&gt; <br/>&gt; ------------------------ Yahoo!
