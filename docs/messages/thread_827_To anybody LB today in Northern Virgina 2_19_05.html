<div> </div>
<div>"...and on the weekends we would barbecue, and say 'delicious, delicious.'"</div>
<div> </div>
<div>I really enjoyed those Accotink boxes too.  I have a theory that there are more in the O&amp;A RR series.  It is a Letterbox/Geocache hybrid.  I remembered seeing somewhere that the geocache was a series.  Maybe the other geocaches have other stamps.  I just have to get down there with my GPS sometime.  </div>
<div> </div>
<div>I want to go back in the spring to stand on the pedestrian bridge over the railroad and watch the trains go by.  I once saw the Southern Crescent in green liveried steam pass by there.  </div>

5 boxes would have taken you about 15-20 minutes. If you're slow...just
ask SD and Jen!<br/>

In just the few hours I had I <br/>
managed to find Audubon and Audubon 2, five boxes in all.  All were in <br/>
fine shape.<br/>

&gt; It's freezing cold but the skys are clear blue... I've spent three<br/>
&gt; consecutive weekends terrorizing Lake Accotink ... I think I have<br/>
&gt; found everything there is to be found... (including that very old<br/>
&gt; A&amp;O RR LB/Geocache). I heard back from the placer of the Lion
Witch<br/>
&gt; Wardrobe Series...  the Lion &amp; Wardrobe are definetly MIA...
however<br/>
&gt; the Witch was there if anybody is interested. Today I'm heading out<br/>
&gt; to a new location (for me) to see if I can find some other two year<br/>
&gt; old letterboxes.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I have found some mystery boxes that are alive &amp; well:<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; "Top Secret"... Jem Heist's brand new "Cardinal" and (after<br/>
&gt; reporting it missing!) I did manage to find "Bastion"<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; If anybody else is out in NoVa today... share your results please!<br/>
&gt; BTW...don't tell me where it is if you have... but has anybody<br/>
&gt; solved the Temporary Haiku Mystery?<br/>
