of his rest.<br/>
<br/>
"Why must I keep getting disturbed by these treasure seekers?  Being <br/>
a great wizard is difficult enough as it is  This place is too far <br/>
South and too close to major populations!  I need to fly and fly <br/>
North!"<br/>
<br/>
So fly he did, in the form of the blue banded hawk.  North he flew, <br/>
past the town where folks sing "867-5309" and other silly songs in <br/>
search of treasure  He flew to a place that could be considered <br/>
semi-eponymous by some.  When he arrived he found that he could only <br/>
read part of a sign<br/>
<br/>
C-RI-T--N<br/>
T-AIL<br/>
<br/>
But he felt that this would lead to the best place to hide.<br/>
<br/>
As before, he followed swirling yellow at his periphery and then <br/>
when forced to make a decision felt that green would be better to <br/>
follow.  Down he went to a place where there was the remnant of a <br/>
less efficient mode of transport.  Further he flew until he spotted <br/>
an unusual tree across a small waterway<br/>
<br/>
"That tree would be perfect for a hanging, perhaps that scare away <br/>
these persistent treasure seekers!"<br/>
<br/>
From the spot across from this hanging tree, he nestled in at 140 <br/>
degrees and 16 paces underneath a nice safe stone beside a stout <br/>
twin tree.<br/>
<br/>
"Surely I shall not be disturbed here," he thought as he dozed off.</div>
