<div>After two weekends with nary a hint of boxing, Dude and I finally poked our heads out the door this morning, sniffed the air (well, I did, Dude sniffed his butt) and decided we had to get outside. We headed downtown and had a great time finding "The Persistence of Winky" box. Ton's of people around, it was difficult being discreet but I think we managed to pull it off. We parked on the other side of Kelly Drive in Fairmount Park and took a leisurely stroll up to the Art Museum. Found the box, and hiked around for awhile. Great stamp by Winky!</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Then we boogied back north and swung by Pennypack Park to find Somecomics' Birdhouse Box. Again, great stamp. Team Wink and a Smile are some wonderful carvers. Dude and I seemed to be the only ones in the park, it was so peaceful. As much as I enjoy getting together with my fellow boxers to go boxing, I must admit that my favorite hunts are when it's just me and my old mutt, taking a meandering stroll through the quiet woods. I can't describe the peace and contentment it brings me. We're not prolific hunters, only 2 boxes in 4 hours, but we sure do enjoy ourselves. </div>

<div>Hope everyone had a great day, however you spent it.</div>

<div><font color="#000080" face="Eras Demi ITC">We boxed today too, but it was 
friggin' COLD!  At least for a Southern girl it was, and I was 
unprepared.  EEK started crying at one point because her toes hurt!  
We found all six of the Eggcellent Eggstravaganza and even planted EEK's newest 
creation, which (except for some help with the stamp) was ENTIRELY her 
doing.  You'll understand when you find it!</font></div>
<div><font color="#000080" face="Eras Demi ITC">We hoped to find the Wild Indoors 
but were a bit too late--will have to try again another day.</font></div>
<div><font color="#000080" face="Eras Demi ITC">Hope you all had a great day--I 
for one am thrilled to be back in the nice warm house while Krash goes to the 
store to buy cat food and return overdue movies!  :)</font></div>
