SunsetRocks lb in Michaux State park,   If anyone of you get the <br/>
chance the hike is very nice, parking by a slightly snow covered <br/>
stream , and the hike to the ridge of the mountain, i have to say my <br/>
legs still hurt today, but once at the top beautiful rock <br/>
outcroppings overlooking the valley, its a must, one I would hike <br/>
again to bring friends to  just for the mountaintop experience,   <br/>
the box was tucked away just where it should be and a very great <br/>
bonus for the hike,  not to mention the snow covered rock climb down <br/>
the mountain/  Brickman said I need to get in shape to do these <br/>
boxes,  I said I'm getting in shape by doing these boxes,,,  its <br/>
just so hard to practice mountainclimbing in Delaware...  JC\<br/>

<p>LOL! Especially when your highest point in the state is Mt. Cuba, which is in the middle of a road a couple of hundred feet (if that) above sea level. Ah, but I do love the First State...</p>
