<div><font size="2">I just realized that I can post a "letterboxing I did this weekend, or week. whatever. &lt;s&gt; I did three stamps for the Texas gathering that I was going to go to before the pesky foot thing raised it's ugly toe. They are doing a western themed Clue game. So I did box. I did! Sort of. I'm supposed to be back to normal, or as normal as I ever get by the middle of March, which is getting closer and closer every day, in spite of the blanket of wet, white stuff rapidly accumulating outside my window. </font></div>
