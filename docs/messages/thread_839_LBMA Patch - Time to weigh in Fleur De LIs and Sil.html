<div>Well, it's funny you should ask Warcat, Chilipepper, etc. I emailed our moderators about this a month or so ago. I have gotten pricing on having the LBMA imaged made into a patch. That, by the way, is just an image Silent Doug came up with after modifying the LBNA image. But SD had a better idea (as usual). He felt we should open it up to the list to create a patch for LBMA, like the NE list did. I have check a couple of sources on pricing and if we keep the patches no larger that 2.5 X 2.5, square or round, no more than 5 colors, we should be able to get them made for $2-$3 or something like that. So, our fearless leaders will set the specifics, but now you have a little info. Put on your creative thinking caps and start...um...thinking.</div>

<div>Give them as few choices as possible. Trust me on this! LOL Choices confuse people! bahaaaaaa</div>
<div> </div>
<div>I would offer one serious word of advice, if you're interested......I'd keep it off the list totally after the initial general information post. Tell everyone to contact you off list and if they post to the list about it, they won't get an answer. That way you don't have to worry about that aspect of it, or feel guilty about it. You could even set up a separate mailbox on yahoo so the stuff wouldn't go into your regular mailbox. Try and get all the needed info into that post, and then when someone e-mails you with questions, send them a copy of that post if at all possible.  </div>
<div> </div>
<div>I know it all sounds good on paper, and then the human factor raises it's ugly head, but all you can do is try!!  </div>

<div>Yeah, I offered about 8,colors and four styles short sleeve, long sleeve, tanks and kids. The worst part was trying to post the info but not beat the lists to death with it. And then there was the questions...the majority of which came from folks who never purchased. I had one person email me 6 times with 6 different questions (which was all included in the info post) and when all was said and done, didn't order anything!!! But everyone who did purchase was just great and all in all it went well. Plus a gathering grew out of it which was a lot of fun so I am really glad I did it (twitch, twitch goes the left eye). But next time, I will only offer about 4 colors. Sometime this year I'll do it again. <br/><br/><b><i></i></b>

L, XL, XXL).  That should make your life much easier, and lower the <br/>
