<p>What time are we meeting up there Saturday.  I'me excited to go. So far I know some time some where in the park we are meeting Saturday.  I don't have a cell phone so probably can't be reached if I'm wondering around somewhere in that big park.  I'm meeting up with 2 friends also but they are lookin to me to give details.  Anyone know anything else?</p>

Yep the camping extravaganza is still on for May 22-23 at Patapsco<br/>
State Park in central MD - cicadas or no! We went out and bought a<br/>
screen room to hang out in, if necessary! I tentatively have six<br/>
groups interested (two with furried friends) so we will be camping in<br/>
the pet loop in the Hollofield area. If anyone else would like to<br/>
join us, please e-mail me off-list at eileenbriley at yahoo dot com.<br/>
<br/>
Plans are to meet early on Sat.morning to do some LBing, as check-in<br/>
is at one p.m. After that...who knows!<br/>
<br/>
I hope to see you there!<br/>

for a park map - CLICK area map/camp loop map<br/>
Print overall map, then CLICK "View a detail of the camp loop with <br/>
site numbers". Then Print that map. The only connection I could make <br/>
between the two maps is the PLAYGROUND icon.<br/>
<br/>
I'll probably arrive about 9AM -- although I am only day tripping.  <br/>
So I'll be the lost soul standing in the middle of the Pet Loop <br/>
without a pet.<br/>
