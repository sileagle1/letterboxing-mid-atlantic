<div>Well now, see, that's my point. You say ".............a surprising number of them are still out there." Maybe other people think it's part of the mystic to spend weeks or even months trying to figure out complicated clues, bust their butt to get to where the box is supposed to be and then find it gone, but hiking out in the glorious outdoors notwithstanding, that's still not my idea of a good time.

<div>I guess one reason I feel the way I do is because living here in nyc with no car, I feel so isolated from the actual activity of boxing. I sit here and read about everyone doing all this boxing every weekend and making it sound so casual and easy, and I'm so jealous. Sometimes it's like people run out for a loaf of bread and find some boxes while they're out. &lt;g&gt; For me it's always such a huge deal and I don't do it often because of that. Making a big trip to look for a special box and have it be gone would be such a huge drag. Just going to upstate NY is going to involve renting a car, which ain't cheap, in spite of what Budget Rental would have you believe. Yeah, I know, poor me. Get over it. &lt;s&gt; </div>

It is far easier to just grab the son and go (yes, we are vehicle <br/>
enabled and having lived near NYC some time I completely understand <br/>
the impracticality of owning a car there), but we collaborate with <br/>
several people to solve these things and it would be kind of scaley <br/>
and reptilian to just use them for their insight and get the boxes <br/>
solo.  Our situation is complicated by our lives outside of 'boxing - <br/>
there are many demands that do take priority (breaking out the worlds <br/>
smallest violin for myself).  So, we make the most of when we can.<br/>

&gt; I'd have to say that all of the Mapsurfer, ShredMTB and Springchick <br/>
&gt; boxes we sought were there, unfound for months and years with the <br/>
&gt; exception of one (one of the SpringChicks, but we were distracted <br/>
by <br/>
&gt; Hurricane Ivan's flood).  These are, as one would expect, very low <br/>
&gt; traffic boxes that take a lot of effort and a wee bit of intuition <br/>
&gt; to solve.  Ergo, the likelihood of being found, improperly replaced <br/>
&gt; and eventually muggled is very low.  Also, none of the above boxes <br/>
&gt; we found thus far had a particularly killer hike on the order of <br/>
&gt; say, the Pinnacle.  Sometimes the hunt and the company of friends <br/>
&gt; are paramount to finding the box.  But, oh what a rush it is to <br/>
find <br/>
&gt; them!<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Give it a try, you may even find a couple close to Gotham!<br/>

&gt; &gt; Well now, see, that's my point. You say ".............a <br/>
surprising <br/>
&gt; number of them are still out there." Maybe other people think it's <br/>
&gt; part of the mystic to spend weeks or even months trying to figure <br/>
&gt; out complicated clues, bust their butt to get to where the box is <br/>
&gt; supposed to be and then find it gone, but hiking out in the <br/>
glorious <br/>
&gt; outdoors notwithstanding, that's still not my idea of a good time. <br/>

we adventure out, you come down on the train and I'll pick you up (I

BTW, I'm going to be in NYC on March 20.  The Cyclone opens that day,
