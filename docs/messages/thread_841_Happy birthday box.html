(Cactus, he's finally a letterboxer!!) planned a special day of <br/>
letterboxing.  First we went to the "create an impression" letterbox <br/>
in ardmore, pa.  I just wanted to say that if you get a chance to get <br/>
this box before it's gone, TRY!! It's a really cool, creative box.  <br/>
Miz Scarlet it is awesome!  Then we travelled out to Douglassville <br/>
for Cyclonics "Letterbox Special" box, very neat.  Then we planted a <br/>
special box called The Happy Happy Birthday Box and had my dad find <br/>
it.  It was so much fun, I'll be posting the clues this week so <br/>
everyone else can find it. Another great weekend of letterboxing, and <br/>
I might sneak some more letterboxing in today before the snow!  Lotus</div>

retail establishment.  This is a great little store<br/>
that will soon close it's doors. Do try to stop by if<br/>
you can.<br/>
