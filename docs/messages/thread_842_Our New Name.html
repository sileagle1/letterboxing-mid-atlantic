After several successful months of letterboxing, and reading <br/>
hundreds (thousands?) of posts from a variety of "veteran" boxers, <br/>
EEK, Krash and I have decided a few things:<br/>
1--There is little reason for us to stamp three different stamps in <br/>
every log we find.<br/>
2--We will probably never box without one another.<br/>
3--The names we chose somewhat hastily lack the pizazz of many of <br/>
the other names we've seen on the boards.<br/>
As a result, we have decided to combine into a single Team, although <br/>
we will still keep our original trail names for times when they're <br/>
appropriate, like gatherings or naming boxes (e.g. EEK's Butterfly <br/>
Box and EEK's Bunny Box).<br/>
I took a vote and everyone who didn't want to sleep on the couch <br/>
voted Aye.  (It was unanimous.)  So here we are:  The Kucifers, <br/>
a.k.a. ChilePepper, Krash and EEK will henceforth be known as Team <br/>
Raucous Auk.<br/>
For a special bonus, figure out how we chose the name and then tell <br/>
me what a kinkajou is related to and how you know (hint: <br/>
procyonidae), and I'll send a clue to a WOM box.<br/>
Hope to see you boxing!<br/>
