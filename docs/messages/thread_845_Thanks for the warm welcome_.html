Guess I am a little clueless on that one. <br/>
<br/>
Anyway, for those who don't know me, here is my little bio. I hail <br/>
from Rocky Mount, NC. I am 27 (yes, really) which seems to be rather <br/>
young in the letterboxing community. I have an 8 year old son named <br/>
Andrew and a "significant other" named Joe. We three make up the <br/>
Penguin Patrol. I have about 2 and a half years of boxing <br/>
experience, but I am probably not the avid boxer most of you are. <br/>
The boxes in eastern NC are very sparce and we don't have alot of <br/>
money to travel alot with. Most recent trip was to D.C. (Found a few <br/>
boxes there, but got hung up on a clue with a nasty cypher from <br/>
Scarab, so no time for other boxes) I have found around 50 boxes and <br/>
planted around 10. I like boxing for the adventures (or <br/>
misadventures), the thrill of the hunt, and the art of the stamp. My <br/>
personal life revolves around the college life right now. (I'm back <br/>
in school...again) As for my job, I am an English tutor at the <br/>
college I attend. I am also a den leader for my son's cub scout <br/>
pack, which eats up alot of my time. My free time is spent reading <br/>
funny mystery books, hanging with my dog, a Boykin Spaniel (look it <br/>
up) named Riley, in front of the T.V., camping if it is warm, and <br/>
whatever various kid activities are on the calendar at the time. I <br/>
have never meet anyone in person from the letterboxing community, <br/>
but look forward to getting to a gather one day soon (Maybe Maryland <br/>
Tempus Fugit) or throwing one (probably at Pocahauntas State Park in <br/>
Richmond, VA in June 2005). I am a little leary of throwing one <br/>
though because of lack of experience. If anyone wants to cohost one <br/>
with me I WOULD LOVE THE HELP AND THE OPPORTUNITY!! I would even <br/>
consider a different location... (please email me if interested at <br/>
<a href="mailto:letterboxer@..." rel="nofollow" target="_blank">letterboxer@...</a>). <br/>
<br/>
Now that I have spilled my guts, does anyone want to tell me a <br/>
little about themselves? Does anyone live in the Richmond, VA area <br/>
or Norfolk, VA area that would like to partner up for boxing? :)<br/>

have family in Virginia Beach that I can stay with if I were to be <br/>
up there, which leaves a whole day for boxing if I go up the day <br/>
before. I will try and post if I am gonna be in the area and maybe <br/>
we could meet for an exchange and/or hunt a few boxes together. :) <br/>
<br/>
I really really do want to do a Richmond gather. I just need to get <br/>
together money with my paycheck at the end of March to rent out a <br/>
picnic shelter and reserve a campsite(s). Scarab brought up a good <br/>
point about Pocahantas being overcrowded in the summer, so I may <br/>
look for another location, somewhere with camping though (and a few <br/>
boxes already in place wouldn't hurt). Right now I am looking <br/>
tenativley at the weekends of June 4, 11 or 18. Can anyone recommend <br/>
a park with camping that is a little less busy? It doesn't have to <br/>
be IN Richmond, but close to it would be nice or at least convient <br/>
to I-95.<br/>
And like I said before, if anyone wants to cohost, I could use the <br/>
help. I don't necessarily need help with covering the costs <br/>
involved, I just need/want experienced guidance and advice and maybe <br/>
some help with setting up the event the day before and/or that <br/>
morning.<br/>

Thanks again for the warm welcome. It has great to meet ALL of you!<br/>
