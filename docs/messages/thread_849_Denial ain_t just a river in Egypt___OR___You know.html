<div>BAHAHAHAHAAAA!!  Poor man. LOL I can't look at :::any::: container like object without seeing it as a potential letterbox. I have bought gum in those little containers some of it comes in now, just to have it, just in case it might work for a container sometime for an indoor box, since it's not waterproof. You never know. Since I discovered Zip Strip takes the commercial labels off of almost anything, I look at lots of stuff I never looked at before. I don't LIKE gum. I threw the gum out.</div>

                    <div id="ygrps-yiv-432734836">So our guest room has become Road Rally Central with all the boxes, stamps, bags, books, <br/>
labels, maps, clue lists, camoflage, return boxes, plates, cups, forks, knives spoons, <br/>
trashbags, etc. etc. laid out in preparation.<br/>
<br/>
Last weekend we had guests.  Their reaction was something like I would imagine you <br/>
would get had they walked in on a meth lab.  They were probing my wife with questions <br/>
along the lines of, "Is there treatment available?" and  "Have you considered an <br/>
intervention?" <br/>
<br/>
My son asked a friend if he wanted to go letterboxing with us.  I answered a phone call <br/>
from a concerned parent who wondered why I wanted to take his son out in the woods.  I <br/>
explained and directed him to the web site for more info, but he declined.  I am sure if I <br/>
had wanted to take his kid to a more wholesome event - like WWF wrestling, he would <br/>
have been fine with it.<br/>
<br/>
I was on a job with some people who know I letterbox.  We were going to be going to <br/>
some highly secure buildings.  They sat me down to make sure I wasn't going to be <br/>
leaving anything behind - like "one of your boxes."  <br/>
I joked, "You can never be sure."<br/>
They became very serious and indicated that leaving a letterbox behind would get me 10 - <br/>
20 years in maximum security.<br/>
I explained that it would do no good for me to put a letterbox in one of the buildings as <br/>
nobody could get to it. <br/>
They didn't look like they bought that story.  Frankly I don't blame them because - <br/>
wouldn't you know it - I spent the whole time thinking about how I could possibly hide a <br/>
microbox in such a way that the general public might be able to.....<br/>
<br/>
Perhaps an intervention is in order.</div>
