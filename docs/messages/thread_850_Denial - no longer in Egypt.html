Or if there isn't, I wonder if it's private property and can I put one there.<br/>
<br/>
I can't read a magazine or watch TV without thinking, I wonder if I can carve that?<br/>
Mental? I guess so.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Just how addicted to this insanely, wonderful hobby have you become? Here's my <br/>
most recent epiphany. I actually turned the stove on and cooked the other day <br/>
and there were some left overs. Being the slob that I am and knowing I have a <br/>
son who works 2nd shift I left them on the stove for him and/or the trash or <br/>
both. I woke up the next day and *gasp*!! SOMEONE USED ONE OF MY LETTERBOXING <br/>
CONTAINERS TO PUT THE LEFT OVERS IN!!! I was freakin' out and my husband looked <br/>
at me like I have 5 heads, which is just crazy 'cause I only have 2, and says <br/>
"Hon, that's what those things were MADE FOR". And I swear, for about 1/2 a <br/>
second I thought HE was nuts and stared at him as if he was speaking in tongues <br/>
when it hit me, OH YEAH! That's what I used to by these little plastic <br/>
containers for! I honestly had forgotten that little fact for a moment.<br/>
<br/>
So how 'bout you?</div>
