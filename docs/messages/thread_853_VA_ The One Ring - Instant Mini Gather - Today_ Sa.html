<div> </div>
<div>I have now carved an event stamp using the Pub logo.  It turned out pretty good.  Well, it just looks pretty much like the logo.  But I forgot to do a date.  Does someone want to carve the date? Since the date the day before is one of those cool, once a century dates, I think we should use the date: 3/4/5 +1. That's a distinctive date that no other gather will have.  I can mail the stamp around to the participants if y'all would like.  Or maybe you'd rather I planted it.  </div>

I'd rather we met again at the Old Brogue (sp?) - other boxes in the <br/>
area I need to get - and they at least know what a 'shandy' is.<br/>
<br/>
And then in the true British tradition - the stamp should be left in <br/>
a box behind the bar!<br/>
