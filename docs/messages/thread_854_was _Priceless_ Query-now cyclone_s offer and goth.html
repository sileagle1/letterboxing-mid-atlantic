<div><font size="2"><font face="Arial,sans-serif"><font size="2">The time Irene and I finally got around to planning a weekend, it poured down rain and we cancelled it. When this stupid foot gets back to normal, I an going to make more of an effort to box, so I'll probably be tagging along with you both more often. And maybe we could all venture upstate sometime too. </font></font></font></div>
<div><font face="Arial"></font> </div>
<div><font face="Arial">You're going to Cooney Island???!! Woo-Hoo!! Depending on the aforementioned stupid foot, hopefully we can get together. I fell down two days ago because of this damn post surgery sandel thing being loose and my big toe swelled up...............way to much information, I know.............and now I can't get the damn sneaker on that I could almost get on before. The doctor said I should be back to work by then but I don't know. We shall see!!</font></div>
<div><font face="Arial"></font> </div>
<div><font face="Arial">All my boxes are alive and well as far as I know. A couple of the teeny logbooks have filled up and I haven't been able to replace them but you can still find them. I have no problem with you not stamping in if there is no room. You could just write Cyclone somewhere.</font></div>
<div><font face="Arial"></font> </div>
<div><font face="Arial">I went on the Cyclone once with my ex-husband, long, long ago, in another time and dimension and kept my eyes closed the ENTIRE time. I just knew I was going to die. </font></div>

<div><font size="2"><font face="Arial,sans-serif"><font size="2">Next time we adventure out, you come down on the train and I'll pick you up (I live 30 seconds from the Cornwells station)?  We can head out, and when done, I'll get you back on the train.  Might be a hassle, but hey, it'll get you out.<br/><br/>BTW, I'm going to be in NYC on March 20.  The Cyclone opens that day, and I hope to get some urban boxes in before I go ride to my heart's content.<br/><br/><span>-- <br/>Nathan Brown </span></font></font></font></div>
