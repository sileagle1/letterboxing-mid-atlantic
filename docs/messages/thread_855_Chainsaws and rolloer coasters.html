</span></blockquote>Yes.  It really needs to be in context.  As Lilo is on the phone with <br/>
"Bubbles," the child welfare officer and former CIA agent, Stitch, whom <br/>
Lilo still for some unfathomable reason still thinks is a dog, is <br/>
fighting of the evil aliens.  He suddenly pops up on a pile of wreckage, <br/>
which is what is left of the house, with a chain saw in his hands.  Lilo <br/>
says to Bubbles, "Oh good, my dog found the chain saw."  It is just <br/>
really funny.<br/>
<br/>
I think I have watched that movie far too many times.  Even weirder, I <br/>
watch the series when I come across it on TV, which is just as funny as <br/>
the movie.<br/>

OK, now back to our regularly scheduled topics.<br/>

I thought it was hilarious. But <br/>then <br/>&gt; I'm a<br/>&gt; &gt;  &gt; little<br/>&gt; &gt;  &gt; warped.<br/>&gt; &gt;  &gt; mmoon<br/>&gt; &gt;  &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;  &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;  &gt; Isn't that a quote from Lilo and Stitch?<br/>&gt; &gt;  &gt; The kids had it on a few weeks agao and I am pretty sure Lilo <br/>&gt; said it.<br/>&gt; &gt;  &gt; Raindear<br/>&gt; &gt; <br/>&gt; &gt; Yes.  It really needs to be in context.  As Lilo is on the phone <br/>&gt; with <br/>&gt; &gt; "Bubbles," the child welfare officer and former CIA agent, <br/>Stitch, <br/>&gt; whom <br/>&gt; &gt; Lilo still for some unfathomable reason still thinks is a dog, is <br/>&gt; &gt; fighting of the evil aliens.  He
 suddenly pops up on a pile of <br/>&gt; wreckage, <br/>&gt; &gt; which is what is left of the house, with a chain saw in his <br/>&gt; hands.  Lilo <br/>&gt; &gt; says to Bubbles, "Oh good, my dog found the chain saw."  It is <br/>&gt; just <br/>&gt; &gt; really funny.<br/>&gt; &gt; <br/>&gt; &gt; I think I have watched that movie far too many times.  Even <br/>&gt; weirder, I <br/>&gt; &gt; watch the series when I come across it on TV, which is just as <br/>&gt; funny as <br/>&gt; &gt; the movie.<br/>&gt; &gt; <br/>&gt; &gt; OK, now back to our regularly scheduled topics.<br/>&gt; &gt; <br/>&gt; &gt; -- <br/>&gt; &gt; Nathan Brown<br/>&gt; &gt; <br/>&gt; &gt; AKA Cyclonic<br/>&gt; &gt; Penncoaster.com<br/>&gt; &gt; Life is like a roller coaster, so enjoy the ride.<br/>&gt; <br/>&gt; <br/>&gt; <br/>&gt; <br/>&gt; Yahoo!
