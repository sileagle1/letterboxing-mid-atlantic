                    <div id="ygrps-yiv-219686202">More than one new box. That sounds like the one I just picked up, <br/>
but mine's called "Seal - Freezer Dishwasher - RECTANGULAR - STORAGE <br/>
CONTAINER". Printed in four different fonts on the label. Catchy <br/>
name, no? 38 oz, rubber gasketed rim, made in China, only $.99<br/>
I'm going to plant it in my back yard to see how it does. It looks <br/>
very promising.<br/>
So I guess I can empty the inferior boxes out of my boxing cabinet <br/>
and bring them up to the kitchen for... um.... food.<br/>

Natt have you given it the 'submarine test'?  Place a paper towel <br/>
piece in the box, seal it, pounce it under water in the sink or a big <br/>
pan/bowl.  Is the towel still dry?<br/>

                    <div id="ygrps-yiv-57241559">I'm just back from the Natty Bumppo Test Kitchen.  Here are the results:<br/>
<br/>
On the theory that warm water would expand materials differently - and thus put the <br/>
rubber/plastic containers to a real test - I submerged 3 containers in warm water for 1 <br/>
minute in my kitchen sink.<br/>
I tested the SureFresh 34oz, the Rubbermaid Seal n' Saver 1.7 pt and the Milan Classic <br/>
"Silent Douggerware."  All 3 came out with dry paper inside.<br/>
<br/>
However all 3 leaked air after 30 seconds which leads me to believe that all 3 will collect <br/>
moisture through heating and cooling out in the real world.  I know we have some <br/>
engineers with us here, so they may want to check my logic.  <br/>
<br/>
The SureFresh appeared to leak the most followed by the Rubbermaid and then the Milan <br/>
Classic.<br/>
<br/>
Yours truly,<br/>
