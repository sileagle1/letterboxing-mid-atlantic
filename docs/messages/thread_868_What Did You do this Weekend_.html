got to go outside boxing again.  The birth of my little grandson has<br/>

while.  I headed to Ashland and found Mother and Black Diamond hidden<br/>
in about 4 or 5 inches of snow.  Then I moved up the road a bit and<br/>
was first finder of True Indigo's Waiting box in Danville.  While I<br/>
was in the general area, I also was first finder for True Indigo's<br/>

a mystery box all by myself!  Well, not exactly by myself, Barney<br/>

I fixed the cracked box for the Spooky Radish yesterday after all <br/>
day Scout Leader training and dropped off the Mr. Moneybags <br/>
Hitchhiker.<br/>
<br/>
Today, Mrs. LB and I went on the Lehigh Valley Wine trail and hit 6 <br/>
wineries, including one near where you were in Schuylkill County <br/>
(Galen Glen in Andreas).  I hit the exerbike for 60 min to deblubber <br/>
a bit.<br/>

What did *I* do this weekend? I was ill all week and even a trip to the store took a lot of <br/>
energy this weekend. I did use the down time to put my head together with RGBisMe and <br/>
design some logos for the lbma patch contest. It made us feel like the weekend wasn't a <br/>

<div>I had a pretty decent weekend.  Sat. I marched with my Civil War unit in the Trenton St. Patty's day parade.  It was nice out, so the parade route was packed.  The people get a kick out of it when we fire our guns.  It is great fun.</div>

<div>Sunday I headed downtown and managed to find two boxes, Where's Ben, a <span class="ygrps-yiv-33632162correction" id="ygrps-yiv-33632162">WOM</span>, and The <span class="ygrps-yiv-33632162correction" id="ygrps-yiv-33632162">Persistence</span> of Wink.  I had no trouble finding Where's Ben, great spot, and fantastic stamp.  I really had no trouble with The <span class="ygrps-yiv-33632162correction" id="ygrps-yiv-33632162">Persistence</span> of Wink, except I had to be <span class="ygrps-yiv-33632162correction" id="ygrps-yiv-33632162">persistent</span>, as the area was packed.  Also, fantastic stamp.  It is a massive box as well, I thought it would be a micro, or I would have dropped a <span class="ygrps-yiv-33632162correction" id="ygrps-yiv-33632162">HH</span> into it, but I left the <span class="ygrps-yiv-33632162correction" id="ygrps-yiv-33632162">HH</span> at home.  I did, however, find a <span class="ygrps-yiv-33632162correction" id="ygrps-yiv-33632162">HH</span>, Peeps Bunny, brand new, and will soon move it along.</div>

boxes at Ball's Bluff, where the unit we portray, the 71PA, got its

will next be down that way, but I will be on the lookout for others.<br/>
