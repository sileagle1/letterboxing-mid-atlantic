<br/>
Is there still a possibility of a gathering in Delaware in May?  It <br/>
looks like the poll for which weekend was preferred has disappeared <br/>
and I was wondering if that meant it wasn't going to happen.  The <br/>
poll was created on FEB 15, but I didn't see any updates or messages <br/>
after that regarding whether a date had been finalized or if the <br/>
potential organizer(s) had changed their mind about planning <br/>
something.  I'd appreciate any updates either way.<br/>
<br/>
We'll be in the mid-Atlantic area May 20-30 (too late for the May 14 <br/>
gatherings!)<br/>

thanks for the message. i am having difficulty (conflicting <br/>
information) with DE State Parks; specifically Cape Henlopen. first <br/>
they tell me a public pavilion is available on a first come first <br/>
serve, then they tell me no, it needs to be reserved and it just so <br/>
happens to be booked until Aug!<br/>
<br/>
they are also telling me different stories about the group camping. <br/>
first it is available for non-profit organization. luckily i can use <br/>
my 501(c)(3)from my running club. then they tell me group camping is <br/>
only available to youth groups!<br/>
<br/>
i'm definitely getting the run around. very frustrating to say the <br/>
least!<br/>
<br/>
in light of this snag, i will need to regroup my efforts and target a <br/>
Fall gathering, unless someone has some pull with the DE Parks <br/>
Department.<br/>
<br/>
i will re-post this message so more people will be aware of what is <br/>
going on.<br/>
