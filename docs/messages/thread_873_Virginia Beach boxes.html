&gt; I'm planning a very quick trip to Virginia Beach to<br/>
&gt; take care of some matters, but thought I might box<br/>
&gt; some of the newer boxes while there if I can find some<br/>
&gt; time one afternoon/evening.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Before anyone jumps on me- I have my clues in hand,<br/>
&gt; know where the boxes are located and have a plan in<br/>
&gt; mind.  I lived in Va.Bch. for six and a half years. I<br/>
&gt; have already stamped into some of the older boxes,<br/>
&gt; such as Ovals of Cassini, Witches of Agnessi, Fort<br/>
&gt; Story,etc. (Is POW missing??) That said...<br/>
<br/>
</span></blockquote>POW??? If you mean Seadog's in the park next to the air station, it's gone<br/>
and I'm not happy about it either.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; I will be traveling with my four legged Buddy, who is<br/>
&gt; elderly, but willing and eager to please.  He will go<br/>
&gt; as far as I do, but that would be pushing it further<br/>
&gt; than is good for him.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; What I'd like to know is if there are any of the<br/>
&gt; listed boxes that are missing or are a bit more of a<br/>
&gt; hike than they would seem from the clues.  I'm<br/>
&gt; particularily concerned about the length of hike for<br/>
&gt; some, since it isn't indicated.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I have clues in hand (but, do I have the time?) for:<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; The Great Outdoors Letterbox Series<br/>
<br/>
</span></blockquote>This took about 20 minutes of walking time (at most a mile, probably a<br/>
little less), 20 minutes of stamping and reading time, and 10 minutes of<br/>
avoid the wasp time. YMMV. I found all four in August. A caching friend<br/>
reported finding one by accident last month.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Great Outdoors Series 2 (how long is the hike?)<br/>
<br/>
</span></blockquote>From the description, it's a drive by if the parking lot is open, and less<br/>
than 200 yards if not. On my to do list.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Banyan Box<br/>
<br/>
</span></blockquote>250 yards or so each way. Take old shoes. Found in July.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Mr. Moody Goes to City View Park<br/>
<br/>
</span></blockquote>Found on Sunday. Maybe 400 yards total. Both in good shape. But you have to<br/>
be very athletic to avoid thorns on one of them.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; EEK's Bunny Box<br/>
<br/>
</span></blockquote>My other Sunday find. Maybe 300 yards for this one. I was first letterboxer.<br/>
A cacher found it before me. I don't know why, the cache is too far away for<br/>
this to be a conflict (I do both and found both). His batteries must have<br/>
died. He never found the cache.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; VA Beach<br/>
</span></blockquote>and<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Munden Point Rail Line<br/>
<br/>
</span></blockquote>Opposite sides of the same park. Maybe a half mile if you park your car<br/>
once. You can shorten that to 600 yards if you park twice. Found in August.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; John and Jackies Wacky Letterbox<br/>
<br/>
</span></blockquote>A drive-by. I'd love to hear of a recent find report. I was an early finder<br/>
and I didn't think it would survive a month in that spot.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; The Old Maid<br/>
<br/>
</span></blockquote>Maybe another 500 yarder. There was a missing landmark when I found it last<br/>
year, but I don't remember enough now to know if that applies to the current<br/>
description.<br/>
