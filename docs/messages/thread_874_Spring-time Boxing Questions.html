                    <div id="ygrps-yiv-2133488912">Hi everyone!<br/>
<br/>
After a winter hiatus, I'm back on the list.  We had too much going on -<br/>
vacation, holidays, birthdays, and a couple of other things - I just<br/>
couldn't keep up with my mail.  But the weather is getting warmer and my<br/>
kids have only two more weeks of "regular" school before we start our spring<br/>
schedule, which includes one day every week for hiking.  Basketball is over,<br/>
too, so now we'll have Saturdays as well.  (Can you picture me drooling? I<br/>
am SO ready to get outside!)<br/>
<br/>
So, what I need are box recommendations in Southeast PA (including the<br/>
nearby NJ &amp; DE area) that won't be too muddy.  Moderately is okay (muddy<br/>
feet, maybe even a bit wet feet), I just don't want to have three<br/>
mud-encrusted children for the ride home.<br/>
<br/>
First on our list for a weekend is to head back to Nolde Forest and finish<br/>
the other two boxes in the series.  We also need to finish Who's the Author?<br/>
in Doylestown IF my youngest can overcome her fear of the the yellowjackets.<br/>
She still freaks when I even mention the word "letterboxing". I'm sure it<br/>
will only take one trip out to cure her, but we may have to tie her up<br/>
first. *grin*<br/>
<br/>
How muddy is Tyler State Park this time of year?  We could get some serious<br/>
mileage in one or two trips out there!  Plus, its very close to home which<br/>
makes it a great week-day destination.<br/>
<br/>
I'm also curious about French Creek State Park.  We'd like to do our first<br/>
plant there and do some general hiking.  Thoughts?  Is it better to plant in<br/>
the Spring (before leaves) or in the summer or early fall when the foliage<br/>
is in full flight?<br/>
<br/>
If we do manage to get our series planted in French Creek, we'll probably<br/>
need someone to adopt it for us.  Most likely we'll be moving out of the<br/>
area before summer and I wouldn't want to leave them unattended forever.<br/>
What's the protocol for adoption?<br/>
<br/>
If your still with me, thanks for any suggestions you have!  Any and all are<br/>
welcome.<br/>
<br/>
Happy boxing,<br/>

forms mud. A good session of shoe banging before getting into the <br/>
car usually works for us. So any boxes in that area should be do-<br/>
able with minimum mess.<br/>
