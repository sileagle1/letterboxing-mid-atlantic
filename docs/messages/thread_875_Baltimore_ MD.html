incorporate the wishes of each family member .... yep, getting <br/>
difficult :)<br/>
As we have never been to this area before I thought I could ask a <br/>
few questions here and be sure to get reliable answers :)<br/>
<br/>
1. MY question (of course *G*):<br/>
any letterboxes that are a MUST in downtown Baltimore?<br/>
<br/>
2. My son's question: (or actually he wants to go there and I need <br/>
the additional safety info - grin again)<br/>
Is the area of The Edgar Alan Poe House/Museum and also and <br/>
especially his grave at Westminster Church Graveyard (corner of <br/>
Greene and Fayette St.) a safe area to walk around with kids (not <br/>
scared of ghost sightings, but real life downtown threats)<br/>
<br/>
3. Coworker recommended a restaurant at Saratoga Street: The Beacon <br/>
Light or Blight:<br/>
same question: safe area plus (hubby now) good food?<br/>
(has been a while since coworker has been there)<br/>
<br/>
4. Any other MUSTs for families beyond the letterbox musts?<br/>
<br/>
Thanks a lot!<br/>
