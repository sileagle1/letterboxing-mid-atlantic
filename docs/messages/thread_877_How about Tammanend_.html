either.<br/>

I have a hard time gauging weather and general muddiness around here, since<br/>
I'm not a native.  I don't even know what would be considered "a lot" of<br/>
rain this time of year. :)  At home in Illinois, the ground is still frozen<br/>
solid and we wouldn't have to be worrying about mud until mid-April or even<br/>
May.<br/>

Please keep the suggestions coming! We have at least two solid months of<br/>
boxing left before we leave and I want to make the most of the time.<br/>
