I think one or more of the boxes we donated to that cause are still missing, right?<br/>
If you can confirm which are gone, I will provide replacements.<br/>
My kids have carved a bunch o' stamps. Just need a good place to put them.<br/>
Please don't offer any non-sunny locations, any of you wise guys.<br/>

Since the Tammanend boxes are mine I'll speak up. I really don't know how well <br/>
that area drains so I can't speak to the mud issue. Also, I have not had any <br/>
"find" notificatons lately so I need to check them out before you guys truck all <br/>
the way up there for one box. I'll get back to ya...<br/>
