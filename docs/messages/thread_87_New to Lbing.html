<br/>
Her Ladyship shall offer her analysis of the cushion conundrum, <br/>
however she feels it first necessary to point out that she believes <br/>
that the word you intended at the open of your query was <br/>
trepidation. Her Ladyship fleetingly considered a tongue in cheek <br/>
diatribe about checking the dictionary first but realized that such <br/>
commentary may not be found humorous. Her Ladyship does however <br/>
lament the loss of the well-crafted correspondence and wishes to <br/>
raise the bar whenever possible. <br/>
<br/>
On to cushioning: Some stamps her Ladyship has encountered are <br/>
mounted on Foamcore® (a commercial product used for presentations <br/>
and displays and which amounts to two layers of poster board adhered <br/>
on either side of a rigid foam material of varying thickness) which <br/>
I believe is used for ease of cutting rather than its cushioning <br/>
properties. I believe that frequently, cushioning is used merely in <br/>
mimic of commercial stamps and may lead to a less than perfect image <br/>
transfer. I find that some carving material is so flexible as to <br/>
deform when pressed onto paper by the uneven fingertips causing a <br/>
transfer of hash marks created when the material is carved away. By <br/>
mounting the stamp on a rigid substrate the stamper (if her Ladyship <br/>
may engage in a bit of neologism) can apply a more even pressure <br/>
without causing certain areas to transfer ink where it was not <br/>
intended. Mounting therefore allows a "cleaner" image transfer and <br/>
prevents the need to carve as deeply. In some intricate stamp images <br/>
it may not be possible to carve deeply and by mounting it even the <br/>
most brutish, heavy-handed stamper will get a "clean" image <br/>
transfer. By adding cushioning to the stamp the high areas may be <br/>
depressed into the cushioning bringing the carved out areas into <br/>
sufficient proximity to the paper as to transfer ink from <br/>
the "background" or carved-out areas.<br/>
<br/>
Her Ladyship hopes this helps in your continued quest for the <br/>
perfect stamp as well in your epistolary endeavors.<br/>

Her Ladyship does however <br/>lament the loss of the well-crafted correspondence and wishes to <br/>raise the bar whenever possible. <br/><br/>On to cushioning: Some stamps her Ladyship has encountered are <br/>mounted on Foamcore� (a commercial product used for presentations <br/>and displays and which amounts to two layers of poster board adhered <br/>on either side of a rigid foam material of varying thickness) which <br/>I believe is used for ease of cutting rather than its
 cushioning <br/>properties. I believe that frequently, cushioning is used merely in <br/>mimic of commercial stamps and may lead to a less than perfect image <br/>transfer. I find that some carving material is so flexible as to <br/>deform when pressed onto paper by the uneven fingertips causing a <br/>transfer of hash marks created when the material is carved away. By <br/>mounting the stamp on a rigid substrate the stamper (if her Ladyship <br/>may engage in a bit of neologism) can apply a more even pressure <br/>without causing certain areas to transfer ink where it was not <br/>intended. Mounting therefore allows a "cleaner" image transfer and <br/>prevents the need to carve as deeply. In some intricate stamp images <br/>it may not be possible to carve deeply and by mounting it even the <br/>most brutish, heavy-handed stamper will get a "clean" image <br/>transfer. By adding cushioning to the stamp the high areas may be <br/>depressed into the cushioning bringing the carved out areas into
 <br/>sufficient proximity to the paper as to transfer ink from <br/>the "background" or carved-out areas.<br/><br/>Her Ladyship hopes this helps in your continued quest for the <br/>perfect stamp as well in your epistolary endeavors.<br/><br/>Respectfully,<br/>Lady Prisspott<br/><br/><br/></tt><br/></blockquote><p>

to glue both surfaces, let them dry till just barely tacky and then <br/>
put them together and weight or clamp them together for a while.<br/>
My personal hangup is lots and lots of coats of spray-on glaze over <br/>
the stamped image on the backing to make it really really shiny. <br/>
Thus I avoid balsa, as it's as porous as a sponge.<br/>
As the Lady stated, pushing hard of the back of an unmounted thin <br/>
stamp can put ink where it shouldn't be, but conversely, if a thin <br/>
wooden backing warps, making the stamp concave, you wind up with <br/>
bare spots and have to press the paper into the hollow to get the <br/>
full image. When test-stamping your stamp during carving, press it <br/>
down with a block of some sort to get an idea of the image as it <br/>
will be with a backing as opposed to without. I have often dug and <br/>
dug at the "white" areas to get rid of that last little line when it <br/>
wouldn't have shown up when backed anyway.<br/>
I recently planted some unmounted stamps in a series, as they have <br/>
to fit carefully against each other to complete the whole image, and <br/>
I knew mounting them would make them almost impossible to line up.<br/>
The situation determines the if and what of the backing.<br/>
