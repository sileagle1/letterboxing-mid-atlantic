Scouting Store to pick up awards for the minions and a some good old <br/>
fashion sweating at the gym, I got the best surprises!<br/>
<br/>
Firstly, thank you to my mystery benefactor who shipped me a <br/>
C.A.R.E. package with 4 Silent Douggerware.  This is most <br/>
fortuitous, as I had bemoaned its sudden scarcity in the western <br/>
windswept suburbarn sprawl of Lower Macungie Township (I live in the <br/>
soutwestern windswept suburban sprawl of Salisbury Township) and us <br/>
having to replace the Scary Radish container.  The timing is perfect <br/>
for sping planting season, if you catch my drift.  So, thank you <br/>
again, oh mystery sender from zip code 19422.<br/>
<br/>
Secondly, Rosie the River Cat's Mountain Laurel PLB has arrived.  <br/>
Thanks on that count.<br/>
