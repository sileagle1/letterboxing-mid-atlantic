                    <div id="ygrps-yiv-450986399">Boxed in Boston as best I could.  I found Head by the Charles, which was a fun little jaunt <br/>
to the river.  I tried to leave a box behind but was foiled at every turn.  I spent hours in <br/>
Boston Public Garden, but every place was too obvious, to populated, or too temporary.<br/>
I found what I thought was a good place actually inside one of the millions of <br/>
commemorative statues in Beantown.  But as I walked away from the plant, one of the <br/>
town's resident, um... vagabonds(?) came on it and took it apart looking for valuables.  I <br/>
recovered what was left and retired to the bar to celebrate St. Patrick's fine <br/>
accomplishments.<br/>
<br/>
I did acquire a hitchiker from far abroad.  Who knows where I will set it free?<br/>
<br/>
Also I think I indoctrinated some converts from Maine.  New blood for our downeastern <br/>
brothers and sisters.  But I did warn them to stay away from Connecticut boxes - they are <br/>
hardly worth the effort.<br/>
