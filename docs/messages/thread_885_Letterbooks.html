"If you have a book where both covers can be bent all the way back, <br/>
do that, and place the pages firmly on a board. Using a sharp drill <br/>
bit, a small one, drill a hole at one corner of the intended <br/>
opening. Unhook the blade from your scroll saw, thread it through <br/>
the hole and reattach it. Then saw out your opening. If you don't <br/>
want the opening to appear right away, fold some pages back with the <br/>
cover on each side."<br/>

touches to make them look like books. Much easier, I'd think, than<br/>
carving out a page. <br/>
<br/>
But if you still want to carve a real book, clue all of the pages<br/>
together first. I did this going away to camp when I was young and<br/>
needed a hiding spot for my chocolate :) I used rubber glue on the<br/>
edges of the book, all 3 sides, and that bound them together well<br/>
enough that I was then able to use an Xacto to cut through the book<br/>
relatively easily. <br/>

</span></blockquote>I just did one a few months ago for a box. I would say that the method you are using is the <br/>
best way to insure good results.  What commonly happens though is half-way through <br/>
your cuts become uneven and you nearly cut through to the page edge.<br/>
<br/>
I used spring clamps to hold the pages firmly in place as I was cutting and just slowly <br/>
worked a dozen pages at a time.  This way also gives you a pretty good interior edge for <br/>
gluing and - if you choose - lining with felt.<br/>
