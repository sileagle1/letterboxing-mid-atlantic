                    <div id="ygrps-yiv-824442168">So. Up the 100 steps. huff, puff. (although we didn't count) Over <br/>
the crest of the hill and down, looking for the rock with the faded <br/>
blazes jutting into the path, begging to be sat upon. All the way to <br/>
the bottom of the hill, which meant we missed it. To go on to the <br/>
second box, or to go back for the first one? How tired am I? How <br/>
much do I want that box?<br/>
UP the hill again. huff, puff. This rock? That's jutting? Take the <br/>
bearing, get off the trail, fall down the hill, find the other rock, <br/>
take the bearing, clamber over to the... crevice?... here?... there? <br/>
Wrong rocks. Scramble back up to the trail and up the hill again. <br/>
huff, puff.<br/>
This rock? Take the bearing, get off the trail, fall down the hill, <br/>
find the other rock, take the bearing, get all scratched by bushes <br/>
going over to the... crevice? Wow, there sure are a lot of crevices <br/>
here. This one? That one? Wrong rocks. Scramble back up to the trail <br/>
and up the hill again. huff, puff.<br/>
This rock? Oh look! Over there's a BIG rock at exactly the right <br/>
bearing. (duh) Stand on big rock, turn to second bearing, and, wow, <br/>
that's a baggie in that crevice right in front of that letterbox <br/>
that's SUPPOSED to be behind a rock.<br/>
The baggie contained the stamp to the SECOND box. My guess is the <br/>
last finders mistakenly took it along with them while walking the <br/>
clues backwards, and just left it there. Bad letterboxers!! For <br/>
shame!! They should have gone right back down and up those hills! <br/>
It's a good thing it all happened today and we were right behind <br/>
them. That poor stamp was very exposed.<br/>
So, to hasten on to the happy ending, we stamped in and left a HH. <br/>
Which means going through the whole 'did I stamp the HH into the <br/>
box? box into HH? me into HH? me into box? box into my book? HH into <br/>
my book?- no, this is the 2nd time I found it...don't need that <br/>
one...' routine. Put the forlorn stamp into my bag. Went BACK down <br/>
the hill on the trail, UP the other hill (huff, puff, of course), <br/>
enjoyed the view, found the 2nd box after only finding the wrong <br/>
pine tree once, stamped in and left the stamp where it belongs.<br/>
So I persevered through my huffing and puffing, and put a wrong to <br/>
rights. I fear something really humiliating is about to happen to <br/>
make me stop patting myself on the back. (Proverbs 16:18)<br/>
