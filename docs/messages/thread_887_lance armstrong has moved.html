Fleur, crank up you calculator, as Lance is within 1 mile of my <br/>

I just like teasing Fleur because Lance has been showing up in my <br/>
boxes and I could be evil and drop him in a Mapsurfer or some such.<br/>
<br/>
I'd never do that though, as I am pretty excited that a few of the <br/>
HH's have made it this far east and believe in fair play!<br/>
