thought they might be able to make it - we'll see.<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
Warcat 76<br/>

of 6 foot hoagies for the afternoon.  If you would like something else, please feel free to <br/>
bring it along.<br/>
<br/>
I will post your tentative start times today on the blog<br/>
<a href="http://www.roadrally.blogspot.com" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.roadrally.blogspot.com</a><br/>
<br/>
Please review them ASAP.  Positions were determined by your preference and the order in <br/>
which you registered.  If you would like to change, I will do what I can until Wednesday.  <br/>
After Wednesday, you will need to find someone to switch with yourself.  <br/>
<br/>
We do have a few more slots available for teams.<br/>
<br/>
A reminder about your plans for Eeevil.  You may not alter the boxes in any way that <br/>
proves to be a disadvantage to the teams that follow you.  You can add to the box but you <br/>
may not move or remove any component of the box.  Teams are only required to complete <br/>
the boxesplaced by the Rally.  Participating in any additional Eeevil (much like life) should <br/>
be of the competitors free will.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
An IMPORTANT REMINDER.  Please review the rules on the blog.  You will need to be <br/>
familar with them at rally time.  There will be a test.<br/>
<br/>
An other VERY IMPORTANT REMINDER.  While this is a competition of speed - of sorts- you <br/>
must follow all the normal conventions of letterboxing.  This includes retrieving and <br/>
replacing the boxes with stealth.  Retrieving, replacing or stamping in in full view of <br/>
Noxers* is not permitted.  You must make every effort to ensure that the box is replaced <br/>
properly and available to the team that follows you.  This was not an issue last year in the <br/>
world's record deluge, but if the weather is nice, it could be a major factor this year.<br/>
<br/>
If there are people around and you cannot replace the box unobserved, you must take one <br/>
for the team and wait.  You are all ON YOUR HONOR to do this.  We do not have the <br/>
resources to police every box and the rally cannot continue without your best efforts.<br/>
<br/>
Grumpy Curmudgeon Hat is off now.  I'm really looking forward to this year.  It's gonna be <br/>
fun.<br/>
