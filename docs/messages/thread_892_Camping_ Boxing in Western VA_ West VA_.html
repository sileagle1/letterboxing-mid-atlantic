There is camping, caverns,and a gorgeous summit to hike or climb, supposedly with a box on top but it might be MIA. I didn't know about letterboxing last time I hiked it. Spruce Knob, the highest point in the state is not far and there are 4-5 boxes in it (2 of them mine!). It's just the greatest area.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Another nice place was Endless Caverns campground. Beautiful campground, great caverns on site to explore.<br/></div>
<div>Anyway, just a few ideas.</div>

Before I was a slowerlowerdelaware girl, I graduated from WVU and <br/>
I'm a little partial to Morgantown WV.  Our next road trip is the <br/>
1st of June and were heading to a week in a cabin at Alpine lake <br/>
which is close to Deep Creek Md, but also only about 40 min. from <br/>
Morgantown with a Rail to trail for biking and about 4 LB that I <br/>
have noticed in the general area.  Also I printed out some LB &amp; <br/>
fossil site clues.  did a search with both in the title Our kids <br/>
always like to look for fossils and in  a LB is there too well <br/>
that's a double find..  HOpe this helps   JC &amp; Brickman.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 Anyone know some great camping, caving, boxing locations in western <br/>
VA, West VA?  Ok, boxing isn't the most important with the young <br/>
teens in tow.  <br/>
