Add WD-40 to your letterboxing kit. Bring pliers. And still look <br/>
inconspicuous.<br/>

and then we can arrange a meet to exchange?<br/>
<br/>
Here are the particulars....<br/>
<br/>
Li-ii-iii-iiii-on, Placed by: Poison Ivy, Washington, DC<br/>
Number of boxes: 4<br/>
<br/>
Clues<br/>
Just South of the Woodley Park Metro Station, at the corner of <br/>
Calvert and Connecticut you are at the North end of the Taft Memorial <br/>
Bridge which is beautifully cornered with four lions. When no one is <br/>
about and their guardian services are not required, each of the lions <br/>
retreat to different bridges.<br/>
<br/>
Down below the bridge is the beginning of a jogging/exercise trail <br/>
that roughly follows Rock Creek. From the Taft Bridge, go down to the <br/>
paved exercise/jogging trail that is beneath it and follow the path <br/>
downstream. You can't actually see the creek from here because of the <br/>
parkway, but soon you'll come to a footbridge that allows you to <br/>
cross the creek. Don't cross it just yet. When you get to the <br/>
footbridge, stay on the righthand side of the creek and follow the <br/>
rocky path just a little to a sewer cover. From the sewer cover head <br/>
North 50 steps up a minor trail to a big tree. Twelve more steps in <br/>
the direction of 260 degrees will bring you to another tree. At the <br/>
base, in a hole, under a large triangle shaped rock you'll find the <br/>
Lion in Spring.<br/>
<br/>
Return to the footbridge, cross it and turn right, headed down <br/>
stream. After a while along this trail, you'll cross the stream again <br/>
on another footbridge. At the end of this bridge is a sign for Lyons <br/>
Mill where the next lion moonlights. There is also a sign about the <br/>
cemetery. You can see it from the path through the razor wire and <br/>
fence line. (People are just dying to get in there.) Anyhoo,... 25 <br/>
steps South up another minor rocky path you'll come to a cool tree <br/>
with a split trunk that was filled with rocks. Kinda neat. The tree <br/>
stands at the tip of a gully, and just South beyond it is another <br/>
tree IN the gully and to the left of THAT is a tree on the hill next <br/>
to the gully. Behind that tree under some rocks sits the Liion in <br/>
Summer.<br/>
<br/>
Go back to the path and turn right. Follow it under another large <br/>
bridge. None of the lions found an appropriate resting place here so <br/>
keep going to the next bridge. This bridge is guarded by Buffalos and <br/>
Indians. Go past the bridge, turn around and look up. The 10th indian <br/>
from the left Looks down at the last stationary rock on your right. <br/>
The Liiion in Fall rests there.<br/>
<br/>
Standing on the path beneath the middle of the bridge, count 85 steps <br/>
(in the way you were originally heading) and you'll find a rooted <br/>
path on the right that leads up to the top of the unadorned and <br/>
rather plain P Street Bridge. Go up and carefully cross P Street to <br/>
the green metal plaque. Around behind the plaque and a little down <br/>
the hill on the left next to the bridge wall lays the Liiiion in <br/>
Winter in a hole with rocks.<br/>
<br/>
Now you're at P and 23rd, just a few blocks from the Dupont Circle <br/>
Metro at Q and 20th Streets NW.</div>
