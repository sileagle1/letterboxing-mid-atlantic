You have to search to even find the messages on the message pages,<br/>
there is so much clutter and advertising.  I also used to just start<br/>
with the first message that I hadn't read yet and  kept hitting the<br/>
"next" button to read each message.  Now we have to scroll down the<br/>
page to find that message and hit "previous" in order to read the<br/>
messages in sequence.  I really dislike this and let them know.<br/>

</span></blockquote>I don't usually look at the messages via the website, but looking at it, <br/>
it really is not that bad.  You can sort them by date or thread (meaning <br/>
replies are directly under the original message), and you can expand all <br/>
of the messages on the same page.  It is not that bad at all, it would <br/>
just take some getting used to.<br/>

new-to-old order instead of old-to-new. So you have to scroll way <br/>
down to get the beginning of a string, and then work your way back <br/>
up the list. So that the "next" message is the one that happened <br/>
before the one you're reading, not after.<br/>
