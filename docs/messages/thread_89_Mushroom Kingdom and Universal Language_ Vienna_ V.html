the baggie is getting a bit beat up and could leak in a bad storm.  (I<br/>

   I've finally got boyfriend excited about looking for hidden boxes <br/>
outside.  We found the Buunyman Bridge box yesterday.  In the log <br/>
book there were several references to a geocache. I'd heard about <br/>
it, and read about it, I just didn't mention it to him because I <br/>
knew it would involve buying a 200$ GPS.  So, boyfriend is at <br/>
circuit city now, buting a 200$ GPS.  So, on top of letterboxing, I <br/>
guess we'll be geocaching.<br/>

  I work at GMU.  I've never been to the Hemlock overlook, but I've <br/>
heard about it.  I've been looking for a place for a LB at GMU.  <br/>
We'll be going back to Bunnyman to look for the geocache stashed <br/>
there.  Did find the equivilent to a hitchhiker in our first <br/>
geocache.  Letterboxing is more fun, in case you were wondering.<br/>
