Does anybody know anything about making patches?  Would any of these designs be more <br/>
difficult to translate into a patch than others?  Or can they do just about anything these <br/>
days?<br/>

Amazing job, everyone.<br/>

<br/>
I am new to this group but have been part of the newboxers and <br/>
letterboxers yahoo group for a while. <br/>
<br/>
I am also a GS leader and have had to have patches made for Girl <br/>
Scouting events.  Price is generally determined by three things:  The <br/>
shape of the patch, (round and square much cheaper than funky sized <br/>
patches) the number of colors, we generally limit it to 4, and the <br/>
percentage of embroidery on the patch.  Some of the ones that have <br/>
little background color require more embroidery (like the one with the <br/>
man and the trees).  The ones with the black and blue backgrounds <br/>
could just be material as opposed to the embroidery.  <br/>
<br/>
A patch company tha tI have used before is called Design-it and they <br/>
do have a website and email service.  Let me know if you need more <br/>
patch companies. <br/>

Anyone interested in patches email me <u>OFFLIST</u> for my snail mail. I will not reply to any posts here. I'll place the order sometime in February once I have the money together. I decided to take orders before I had the patches made so that I can use that money for the purchase. No, I do not have a paypal account, cash, check or money order please. The patch is our logo on the LBMA homepage. Of course, Crayola Posse gets theirs free as it's their design, thanks again guys for a great logo.</div> <div> </div> <div>Alrighty then!</div> <div> </div> <div>H&amp;H</div><p>
