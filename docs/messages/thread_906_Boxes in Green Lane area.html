<div>Just curious how long the road part of the road rally will actually be (in <br/>miles). Hope we will be getting an update soon on the blog.  Also was wondering <br/>if there are boxes nearby that we can find the same day (other than those <br/>planted for the day). Any plans for lunch?  Dinner? <br/></div>
<div>I don't really have 157 boxes in the area, only 30-40 or so.</div>
<div>I uploaded clues to several sets of them plus a map of how to get to the nature center from the pavilion.  Still trying to decide if I can make it there or not.</div>
<div>Most likley leaning toward coming after lunchtime and maybe just exchanging with new friends.  </div>
