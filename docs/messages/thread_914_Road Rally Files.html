I uploaded some more maps just now...<br/>
These are pasted into powerpoint.  Hope you can open them.<br/>
I included detailed directions from the PA Turnpike.<br/>
I also included larger overview maps of the region with my Perkiomen <br/>
Trail box locations (approximately) marked.<br/>
If you are looking for a place to congregate for dinner or drinks, I <br/>
can recommend The Inn at Perkiomen.  It's located less than one mile <br/>
from the Pavilion in Green Lane.  It's on Deep Creek Rd, just off Rt <br/>
29.<br/>
If anyone needs more map help, let me know.<br/>

Are we allowed to have area maps in hand during the RRR?  Or do we <br/>
