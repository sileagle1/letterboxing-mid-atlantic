these lists who expect to attend and I don't want any of you to miss this <br/>
info.)<br/>
<br/>
For those of you thinking about coming to the Finger Lakes gathering in <br/>
central NY on June 11th, please be warned that lodging in the Ithaca area <br/>
is quickly becoming scarce due to Cornell's Reunion weekend.<br/>
<br/>
If you don't already have reservations and can't find anything in Ithaca, <br/>
you might try checking the Cortland area as well. Local state parks with <br/>
camping include Taughannock Falls, Buttermilk Falls and Treman. I know at <br/>
least one family has reserved a cabin on Cayuga Lake - vacation rentals may <br/>
be a little easier to find because local schools will still be in session. <br/>
There's a new Hilton Garden Inn under construction in downtown Ithaca that <br/>
should be open next month, too. I don't know if they're taking reservations <br/>
or not yet, though.<br/>
<br/>
You can find all sorts of information about local lodging, camping, places <br/>
to see and things to do here:<br/>

Feel free to contact me off-list if you have any questions or need more <br/>
lodging info.<br/>

Looking forward to seeing many of you in June!<br/>
