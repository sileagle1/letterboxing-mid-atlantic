<br/>
The reason that most (all) commercial stamps have backing is because<br/>
they're made out of very thin rubber and all of the little lines are<br/>
raised generally less than 1 mm off of the "carved out" areas.  If you<br/>
glue them directly to wood, it's very difficult to apply even pressure<br/>
to the entire stamp (for anything over 1" square), especially the<br/>
middle, and to apply enough pressure to get just the lines and not the<br/>
background areas.  Trust me :).  The cushion makes it all even out. <br/>
The alternative to having a cushion on the stamp is to cushion the<br/>
paper you're stamping on to - like putting a magazine under it. <br/>
<br/>
In general, most hand carved stamps are from thick, rigid material (the<br/>
carving block; plumber's gasket might be the exception), and the cuts<br/>
you make are deep enough that you don't get impressions from the bottom<br/>
of the carved-out areas  (from the little ridges you create in the<br/>
carved-out area is another story).  You generally shouldn't need to<br/>
mount them at all, and if you do, you shouldn't need to worry about a<br/>
cushion.<br/>
<br/>
As someone said (I think Nathan), if you think your stamp needs a<br/>
cushion, you can use the Fun Foam from the crafts store that's less<br/>
than a buck for an 11x17" sheet - and comes in tons of fun colors!<br/>

Subject: New to Lbing<br/>
<br/>
With a little intrepedation do I dare to post.  Perhaps I'm coming <br/>
with my "tail tucked" between my legs.  Another newbie posted a <br/>
question on LbNA, and I posted "hey I was wondering that too", and <br/>
it resulted in a week long flame that still hasn't stopped.  So... I <br/>
try not to post to that list.  I joined the newbie list, and it is <br/>
great, but doesn't have a lot of members yet.  My point is, I have a <br/>
question.  I carved my first stamp, and it's cute, if you ask me :)  <br/>
I was reading on mounting.  I went to Silent Doug's site, and it <br/>
said just to rubber cement it to a piece of wood.  The stamps I have <br/>
seen sometimes had a piece of cushioning.  I've read that stamps <br/>
need cushioning between the wood and the stamp.  I searched the <br/>
archives, and it wasn't much help.  The links on mounting rubber <br/>
stamps were either dead, or offered no information on mounting using <br/>
cushioning.  So, I dare to put the question to a list.  To cushion <br/>
or not to cushion?  That is the question.  And if you do cushion... <br/>
what do you use?<br/>

I often find that unmounted stamps, particularly if they're larger, will <br/>
break after only a bit of use. Of course, it depends on the material; for <br/>
instance, the Speedy-Cut stuff really doesn't hold up very well at all.<br/>
