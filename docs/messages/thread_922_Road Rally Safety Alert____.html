<br/>
Our insurance company has officially notified us that<br/>
as we will be letterboxing in State Game Lands, all<br/>
participants will be required to wear blaze orange<br/>
vests and - get this - Kevlar Chest Protectors.<br/>
<br/>
At first I thought we were sunk, but I have found a<br/>
Military Supply Company in the Lehigh Valley that will<br/>
provide us with (used) Kevlar (Bulletproof) vests<br/>
returning from  Iraq.  Bill Vincent, of DEFENS<br/>
Wholesale and Retail In Bethlehem has offered us a<br/>
rental on these vests at an incredible discount rate.<br/>
<br/>
I know it is a late change, but we will lose our<br/>
insurance if we do not comply.  DEFENS will have the<br/>
vests delivered to the park tomorrow morning in time<br/>
for the third run of the day.,  I am purchasing vests<br/>
for the first two teams in the rally.  If nobody gets<br/>
shot, we should be able to return them.<br/>
<br/>
What I need from everybody is to go to my web site and<br/>
give me size and quantity info.  There will also be<br/>
info on how you can Paypal the fee to me.  Everyone in<br/>
the vehicle must have a vest - even if they do not<br/>
plan to enter the State Game Lands.<br/>
<br/>
I wish I had known about this earlier, but I just<br/>
opened the insurance letter last night.  You can<br/>
imagine my shock and horror.<br/>
<br/>
Here is the link to the site please send the info and<br/>
payment ASAP.<br/>

insisting we had to TRY to go, anyway, I was pulling up the site and<br/>
starting to laugh. You STINK!!! :-D<br/>

"I am not going to wear any vests" and telling him that I have an orange<br/>
hunting vest and he can wear the one that I have for our dog.  Then I was<br/>
trying to figure out if we could make it to my daughter's house tonight<br/>
because her husband has a Kevlar vest and since I am one of the first two<br/>
teams I didn't want you to have to purchase anything for us.  So out of<br/>
curiosity for the price I went to your website ....and zing......I felt like<br/>
the totally airheaded dumb blonde that I am often accused of being!   This<br/>
was very good!<br/>
