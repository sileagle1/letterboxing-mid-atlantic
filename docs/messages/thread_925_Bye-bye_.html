past year.  I'm unsubscribing as soon as I send this message as we're off to<br/>
WARM Arkansas sooner than I had expected.<br/>
<br/>
I did finish carving my Eric Carle series, but since there aren't that many<br/>
boxes in AR I've decided to plant them there.  We're also not going to have<br/>
time to finish Nolde Forest - maybe a vacation a few years from now. :)  I'm<br/>
hanging on to "Who's the Author", with the hope that the kids and I might<br/>
have a free afternoon.  BTW, we did find "Harry Potter's Unicorn" last week.<br/>
It was mudddy, but fun.<br/>
<br/>
Thank you all again! It has been a great boxing year!!<br/>
