After the parade we plan to do some boxing and are wondering if the <br/>
following boxes are still active:  Boxing After Dark, Mr. Jefferson's <br/>
Microbox, Teddy Bear Microbox, Orion the Hunter, Cornucopia, and the <br/>
Cherry Blossoms box of the Washington DC Letterboxes.  We would also <br/>
like to do Natty's Stolen Mascot box but so far the clues have eluded <br/>
us.  We will have to do more work on this during the upcoming week.<br/>
<br/>
If there are any other suggestions for must seeks while we are in the <br/>
area please let us know.<br/>

<br/>
I'm 99% sure that Mr. Jefferson's Microbox and Cornucopia are missing.  <br/>
Searched and searched, and the clues are really straightforward.  If you find <br/>
either of them, please let me know!<br/>
<br/>
Orion was still there as of the end of January, as was Cherry Blossom.  :)  I <br/>
didn't attempt Teddy Bear due to time constraints.<br/>
<br/>
I heard from the placer that Boxing After Dark and Congressional Mascot are <br/>
believed to be missing, so you may want to contact the placer and see if <br/>
there's any further info on those.<br/>
<br/>
Good luck!!!<br/>

missing for me as well.<br/>
