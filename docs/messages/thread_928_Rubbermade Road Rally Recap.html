                    <div id="ygrps-yiv-533818738">Shoichi Yokoi,  a Japanese soldier on the island of Guam in WWII never got his orders to <br/>
surrender.  He lived in a cave for 26 years, surviving on a diet of nuts, berries, frogs and <br/>
rats. <br/>
<br/>
George Donner and 87 men, women and children set out for California from Illinois in <br/>
1846.  After a brutal journey of over 2500 miles they became trapped in the Sierra <br/>
Mountains by heavy snowfall.  After eating their cows and horses, they tried eating bark, <br/>
twigs and even their own shoes and belts.  When the leather ran out, they ate each other.<br/>
<br/>
Ernest Shackleton was trapped on the frozen Antarctic ocean for 15 months.  Then he and <br/>
his men sailed over 800 miles across brutal seas in open boats to a small mountainous <br/>
island.  After scaling the mountains and crossing the island Shackleton returned to rescue <br/>
his men.<br/>
<br/>
Wussies.  All of `em.<br/>

They never could have survived<br/>

<br/>
Reading all of the posts from the other Road Rally folks warms my heart and brings a <br/>
ready smile to my face because we made some good friends yesterday. A tip o' the <br/>
rubbermaid lid to Rally Master who was truly a master at setting up a great time.<br/>
<br/>
I will write way more later but we are off to NYC after our 4 hour drive home last night. <br/>
THAT was an adventure too!<br/>

despite the weather. Drove home from CT Saturday morning and can <br/>
appreciate the effort made by all the participants. We were able to get <br/>
9 boxes on Thursday and 1 on Friday. We are lucky that two of our kids <br/>
live in CT and can always find time for an hour or two of boxing while <br/>
visiting. It seems that no matter where in CT you go there are lots of <br/>
boxes a short distance from wherever you are. <br/>
