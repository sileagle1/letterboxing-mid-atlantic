Patapsco but one of the ADG is in need so I probably won't make it.  <br/>
<br/>
ADG #2, Cat, is very much like her namesake.  She enjoys quiet <br/>
places where she can de-frag, nest, and nap.  Recently her home has <br/>
been completely torn up!  Two unrelated water incidents left her <br/>
with wet carpeting and damaged dry wall in the basement and a <br/>
leaking water filtration system buckled the floor in her kitchen.  <br/>
Thankfully home owners insurance covers both but in the meantime 2 <br/>
floors of her house are ripped up including our basement sanctuary.<br/>
<br/>
So I will be going over to calm the ruffled Cat feathers.  If she <br/>
perks up a bit I may be able to persuade her to come out to <br/>
Patapsco.  Don't count on us though, the nesting instinct runs deep <br/>
in that one.<br/>

</span></blockquote>I'm not either. I have a dress to finish for my daughter's Jr/Sr <br/>
Banquet on Tuesday, and Sunday's taken up with the usual church <br/>
services and a barbeque for my son's Drama class. We'll be in <br/>
Trenton on Monday with a whole bunch of other homeschoolers rallying <br/>
in protest of A1918, so maybe I can nab one or two in that area <br/>
before heading home.<br/>
