</span></blockquote>Thanks for the great photos Jan! I am usually one to snap a lot of shots but I was so <br/>
overwhelmed with everything that I didn't get one of you 2, so sorry! We were together so <br/>
much on the trail there were a lot of great shots of you I could have gotten. How about us <br/>
sitting there looking blankly at that fence that closed the final stretch of road to the <br/>
second box?  Or us passing each other going opposite directions looking for Foy Park "2 <br/>
miles" down the road. Best one yet, I should have gotten you trying to replace that box up <br/>
in the tree in the pouring rain. Us vertically challenged boxers had a lot of fun retrieving <br/>
that one!<br/>
<br/>
Despite distracting me from shooting lots of photos, being overwhelmed at the Road Rally <br/>
was a terrific experience. Overwhelming warmth from fellow boxers, careful planning on <br/>
the part of the Rally Master &amp; family, rain from the skies, mud from the ground, exchanges <br/>
to be made, and generous prizes given out made this a day to remember.<br/>

Thanks for sharing your cool new site June!<br/>
<br/>
Allow me to also share mine:<br/>
<a href="http://trueindigo.blogspot.com" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://trueindigo.blogspot.com</a><br/>
<br/>
It includes a new mid Atlantic region box of mine that I have no other way of posting at <br/>
this time.<br/>
<br/>
We only had enough energy yesterday for "Yo Taxi" before we went to see kiddo perform. <br/>
Looking forward to the rest of your boxes next time.<br/>
