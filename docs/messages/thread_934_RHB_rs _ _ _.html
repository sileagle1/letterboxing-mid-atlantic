                    <div id="ygrps-yiv-350895999">. . . had a blast at the RRR. Irene the MadHatter and I (TopHatBox'r)<br/>
practiced boxing on Fri so we would be in shape for the big Rally.  <br/>
And as noisey as we can be, the first 10 min after we opened the <br/>
envelope and headed to the first clue point there was total silence in <br/>
the car.  Now that was some serious concentration!  But it only lasted <br/>
10 min then we were yelling at each other and headed in opposite <br/>
directions.  It's a good thing we are both lefties. . .enabling our <br/>
brains to evenutally get back on the same track.<br/>
<br/>
But RallyMaster is the best. With fun and games and laughter thru all <br/>
these months of waiting for the big day --- they (all the ID's) made <br/>
it the best rain party ever.  <br/>
<br/>
Thank You RallyMaster.<br/>
