<div> I was wondering if there is any way to get access to the clues for<br/><blockquote><span title="ireply">  &gt; Deep Creek Area Boxes posted in the files section if I don't have the<br/> &gt; ability to open them since they're in powerpoint?   Maybe I just don't<br/> &gt; understand how to access them.  We're planning a WV trip as soon as<br/> &gt; school is out and will be boxing that way in early June.  (adults<br/> &gt; only) wahoooo! JC   thanks<br/><br/> </span></blockquote>No problem.  I took the box information and put it in PDF form.  You <br/>should have no problem reading them now, and I am sure Raindeer won't <br/>mind.  They are loaded in the files section.<br/>-- <br/>Thanks, Nathan.</div>
<div>I have no problem at all with this.</div>
<div>If I could figure out how to convert them, I would have.</div>
<div>In case people are concerned about such things, the Deep Creek Boxes use store bought stamps.  They are among my earliest plants and I was not a carver yet.  I may replace them this spring with hand carved since I enjoy that as much as hunting these days.</div>
<div>The Green Lane Nature Center boxes are all hand carved.</div>

<div>Glad to hear you all survived the RRR.  Wish I could have joined you.</div>
<div>I was on a spin bike for 3 hours that morning.</div>
