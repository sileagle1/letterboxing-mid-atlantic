                    <div id="ygrps-yiv-996154917">I went back to the scene of the crime(s) to recover the boxes from the Rubbermade Road <br/>
Rally.  I have recovered most of the boxes and they will soon be on their way home.<br/>
<br/>
The bad news is Box #1 looks to have been under about 8 feet of water at one point.  It <br/>
appears to have gone MIA.   The whole area is covered with flotsam.  Many trees came <br/>
down and many others were deposited there.  I spent about an hour digging through logs <br/>
and branches with no joy.  So the wonderful Jeep stamp by the MayDay Lillies is gone as <br/>
well as the cuckoo clue left by Janila.  And here I thought we made it through without <br/>
casualties.<br/>
<br/>
I will be back in the area in the next few weeks and will try again, but I am not hopeful.<br/>
<br/>
In addition, would the owners of Camera Shy Owls and the Falcon Microbox please contact <br/>
me off-list.<br/>
<br/>
My many, many thanks to everyone who helped make the Rubbermade Road Rally a <br/>
success, and to the incredible generousity of the participants.</div>
