Tom and I will be prowing the Upper Perkiomen Valley (the Road Rally <br/>
Zone) to find some Raindears, Skiing Bees, a couple of left behind <br/>
bonus boxes and some that we have wanted to do for some time.<br/>
<br/>
Perhaps even planting some Chineses Animals....<br/>
<br/>
We'll be prowling Saturday afternoon (as he has Karate in the morning).<br/>
<br/>
Contact offline if you are like minded - I can get you our cell if you <br/>
want to meet and greet.<br/>
