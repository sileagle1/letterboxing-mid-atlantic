<br/>
More or less, we'll be looking to hoist a caber, find a frog and then <br/>
head south as long as Tom stays interested.  Perhaps to plant some <br/>
Chinese zodiac in the NW corner of Green Lane.  I'll email you my cell <br/>
off line.<br/>

<br/>
Thanks for the kind words.  I enjoyed meeting you, Lady Prisspott and <br/>
your friend Patty as well.  Thanks for passing through Allentown and <br/>
taking the time to meet me.  Tom enjoyed the stamps fromt he exchange.<br/>
<br/>
Any plans for a Priusspott personal traveler?<br/>
