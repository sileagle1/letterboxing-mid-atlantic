Since back surgery has severely limited my underground activities I am thrilled to be able to hunt letterboxes above ground while my fellow cavers are having a blast below. I used to just sit around and drink beer all day, and that was fun too! Anyway, Saturday is wide open for us until about 4 then we have to be back at camp to help cook the club dinner. I would love to meet up with some local boxers for exchanges and hunt some boxes. If anyone will be available please email me off list. Also, if anyone has any favorite boxes in that area that they recommend I'd appreciate that info as well. Take care all and have a great weekend!</div>
