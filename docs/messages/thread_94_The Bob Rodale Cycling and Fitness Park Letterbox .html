From Allentown, PA, take route 222 West. Continue on Route 222 for <br/>
0.2 miles after it crosses Route 100. Turn right on Mosser Road. A <br/>
sign will show this as the way to the Lehigh County Velodrome. The <br/>
Velodrome is on your right, and the park is on your left. A parking <br/>
lot is provided.<br/>
<br/>
From the welcome sign at the parking lot, head 300° towards the <br/>
monument.  Take a time to reflect and remember when Bob Rodale was <br/>
born and died.  From the monument, head 318° on a path that curves <br/>
west and enter the woods.  Be sure to obey the rules, remember that <br/>
phone number (abc) def- hijk and follow the command to turn left!  By <br/>
now your heading should be 4 times the difference between the birth <br/>
and death year of Mr. Rodale.  Head in the slow lane for about 1/4 <br/>
mile.  At this point, any self-respecting letterboxer would choose a <br/>
trail over a paved road!  Your bearing should decrease by 10°.  Take <br/>
the earth path from this part of the phone number:  (abc) def-hijk  -<br/>
  baj° is your bearing.  Along the path you will find all sorts of <br/>
cool things like a small birdhouse covered in corncobs.  Your path <br/>
will now snake to bbh° and then 5a°, then due north then finally <br/>
k5°.  You will come to a boardwalk, follow it through the swampy area <br/>
and past 3 totally ducky benches.  At the end of the boardwalk there <br/>
will be a small stone monument to a Reading, PA bank that got gobbled <br/>
up by Core States which got gobbled up by First Union (hint: the name <br/>
started with M and describes a "a great circle on the surface of the <br/>
earth passing through the poles").  The box is so close you can smell <br/>
it!  From the center of the end of the boardwalk, go forward 5 paces <br/>
at a bearing of 7f°, then look under a log at bjf°.<br/>
<br/>
The first to find will get a special bonus of a rather chubby dawg!<br/>
<br/>
To exit the part, go north on the gravel path that will emerge from <br/>
the forest.  Pass McAfee's rock to another boardwalk that will return <br/>
you to the monument.<br/>
