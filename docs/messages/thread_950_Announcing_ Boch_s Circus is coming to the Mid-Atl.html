<div> </div>
<div>I am Phineas Boch, Ringmaster of Boch's Circus, the most amazing, impressive, traveling collection of skilled, physical entertainment, magic, side show, and exotic animals to be found hidden in the forests and parks around our country.  </div>
<div> </div>
<div>Bringing art, outdoor entertainment, and puzzles, to one region after another, our circus menagerie is especially good for those with a dearth of local boxum adventures or with a gather on the horizon.  </div>
<div> </div>
<div>I have assembled from around the region and around the world the most impressive, talented, and may I say astounding collection of acts to be enjoyed by an appreciative audience.  You will see amazing animals, impossible jugglers, shocking sideshows...  ["Yeah, and bombastic ringmasters!"  "Shhh. Quiet back there."] ... as I was saying you will be astounded by our nascent troupe of a dozen or more performers.  </div>
<div> </div>
<div>Even now I am receiving boxes from around the country to hide in the  Maryland countryside.  We may even have party crashers come on their own to show their talent (hint, hint).  (I happen to know of one tiny teddy bear who has decided to run off and join the circus in the Animal Crackers sideshow.)</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Come one, come all to our first stop in beautiful, bountiful, boxious, Boyd's, Maryland at the Mid-Atlantic Spring Gather hosted by the inimitable Tempus Fugit on May 14th only a few short weeks away.<br/></div>
<div>I remain truly and sincerely, your humble entertainer,</div>
<div>Phineas Boch</div>
<div>RIngmaster or Boch's Circus<br/><br/>(Gather information is posted in the events on AtlasQuest.com and Letterboxing.info .)</div><p>
