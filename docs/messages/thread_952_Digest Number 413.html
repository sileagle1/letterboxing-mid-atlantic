<div>Kirby Rider and I had some fun today, finding the elusive green tree <br/>frog (3rd try is a charm - mud scared Tom the other times) and that <br/>haggis eating caber tosser (who was muggled in our last trip).  We saw <br/>the Sunrise, ate a PA State Apple and had our fortune told by a Fishy <br/>for F200.  We tried to hit Midnight Moon from the Schwenksville side, <br/>but Tom was bonking.  7 miles is a bit much for an 11 yr old on only <br/>the 2nd foray of the year.  Next time, that with a skiing bee?<br/><br/>Still a great day and thanks to Raindear, Silent Doug and Turtle <br/>McQuade for cool boxes....<br/><br/>Have an idea for a new HH "Dogs are Barkin'" &lt;- for those that remember <br/>John Candy in "Trains, Planes and Automobiles"....<br/></div>
<div>LB,</div>
<div>So the tree frog is there?  Good.</div>
<div>I plan to replace with a hand carved version later this spring.</div>
<div>Got a real nice Blue Butterfly carved, just need to run it out to the park.</div>
<div>I have been working on a 5 stamp project for my Adventure Guides group.</div>
<div>These will be (unfortnuately) located on private camp grounds and not generally available to the public.  I placed them yesterday, but may need to fine tune the clues for our younger seekers. Also, I managed to pick up a tick (pretty small so I suspect a deer tick).  It was a bitch to dig him out.  And I was wearing long jeans and boots.  It was way up by my knee. </div>
<div>Moral: you can't be too careful.  Suggest bug repellent of some variety.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>I liked Planes, trains and autos too.  For anyone who has to travel much, it really hits home.  I'd be up for a joint planting project.</div>
