ceremony for Scarab, the winner of the stamp carving from the Road<br/>
Rally last weekend held at the SeaSea and Co in Occoquan, VA. <br/>
Sewsowbizzy also showed off her hard earned second place trophy.  We<br/>
had a great time and enjoyed meeting several new letterboxing<br/>
afficiendos - Tempus Fugit, Dead Duck Chuck, Night Owl and Gallant<br/>
Rogue as well as renewing Sewsowbizzy and Scarab's acquaintance.  The<br/>
pictures (yes, of course, I had a camera) have been added to the RRR<br/>
photo folder.<br/>
It was a beautiful day for a drive and we managed to detour through<br/>
Washington and caught a glimpse of the cherry blossoms along with<br/>
about a million other sight seers!<br/>

                    <div id="ygrps-yiv-1331863165"><div>Great pictures, thanks.  What you can't see is how very excited I was with my prize of a Backpack Stool.  This is just so awesome.  I  was speechless.  </div>
<div> </div>
<div>It was really great to see the Red Hat Boxers trophy.  It is really cool.  I joked that Judy should put a log and stamp in it and plant the whole thing in a big hollow tree.  </div>
<div> </div>
<div>Gathers are always special when someone comes from far away.  It was really great to see and talk with Jan/Team Little Dog again.  I was so glad she brought her log so I could see the RRR stamps.  What a great collection.  Jan has a fabulous scrapbooked log.  Next time I want to look through it more.  Jan got to stamp into the next two Games PLB Ring boxes so I can send them on the next person past her.  Jan saves some postage, woohoo. As usual for these mini-gathers people brought various stamps and boxes to share.  Works in progress, PLBs (with permission), and of course a couple of the RRR stamps.  </div>
<div> </div>
<div>Beforehand we got to do some of Gallant Rogue's new mystery boxes.  I'm not giving anything away to say that the stamps are very impressive.  Great parks.  We were very excited to watch Osprey flying around their nests.  We also visited Witch Way letterbox.  We found it completely waterlogged, except for a winter note from Gallant Rogue, "Couldn't stamp in because the log is Frozen." We had to laugh.  Sewsowbizzy took the log home to dry out.  We left some cards for people to stamp into.  After the gather Sewsowbizzy, Tempus Fugit, Dead Duck Chuck, and I picked up Jem Heist's fun Beatles series at Accotink.  Thanks to Gallant Rogue for the short cut bridge over the RR tracks.  Tuxie reallly did not want to cross that bridge with it's open graing deck.  Chuck was good enough to walk her around, down over the tracks, and back up the other side.  </div>
<div> </div>
<div>
<div>I really like these mini-gathers.  I enjoyed seeing everyone.  Judy/Sewsowbizzy picked a fun restaurant in quaint, fun to stroll, Occoquan.  She carved very fine event stamp.  Many thanks.</div>
