and it appears that it has gone MIA.  This was a<br/>
Virginia Beach Letterbox.  I remember that someone had<br/>
it on their list to do about two weekends ago, but<br/>
can't remember who.  I was wondering if you had any<br/>
luck finding it.  I did notice that the park did some<br/>
brush clearing and old fence removal perhaps that was<br/>
the derailment of the Railroad.  Please notify me off<br/>
list if you have any knowledge of the Munden Point<br/>
Railroad.<br/>
<br/>
Thank you<br/>
