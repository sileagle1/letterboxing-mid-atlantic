(Lunabar) joined Gwenllian, Lil'E, and me for the day. Iplaytunes is<br/>
in the UK right now. Unfortunately, he wasn't able to fit in any<br/>
letterboxing.<br/>
<br/>
Found Messenger of Peace - the box is in great shape, but needs a new<br/>
logbook - we used the last page. We put some extra pages in the back,<br/>
but it will need a new log soon. Does anyone know how to reach Perfect<br/>
Circle Letterboxing Guild? I haven't figured out a way to contact them<br/>
to let them know.<br/>
<br/>
Also found Ssssssss! - Great box, Bev! I wanted to keep going and<br/>
check in on "O Be My Friend", but the rest of the gang was tired. <br/>
<br/>
Gorgeous day to be out boxing. Saw lots of folks near Messenger of<br/>
Peace who looked like they were out geocaching - they didn't seem to<br/>
be looking in the direct area of Messenger of Peace, though.<br/>
<br/>
Lots of ticks out, though. I pulled one off of myself this AM, even<br/>
after checking when we got home yesterday. Yuck - I've been itchy all day!<br/>

It had someone named Brian at the other end last summer when I needed <br/>
to contact them. Someone here knew an alternate way into the LbNA <br/>
database which revealed the email address from which clues get <br/>
submitted, and I can't remember who, or how they did it. <br/>
(Note to those using their own webpages for clues - include contact <br/>
information or button - something the equivalent of the LbNA "contact <br/>
the placer" button.)<br/>
The PCLG boxes are, IMO, some of the finest boxes, with the most <br/>
intriguing clues, in NJ. Unfortunately, it seems the group went on one <br/>
big planting/posting/finding blitz a few years back and then subsided, <br/>
leaving these boxes for the most part unmaintained. The website itself <br/>
was updated about a year ago, but the clues remain pretty static, and <br/>
don't always reflect true box status.<br/>
I'm glad M of P is still there and OK; it was my second find when I <br/>
started boxing.<br/>

contains a really gorgeous handcarved stamp - the lettering is very <br/>
fine.</div>
