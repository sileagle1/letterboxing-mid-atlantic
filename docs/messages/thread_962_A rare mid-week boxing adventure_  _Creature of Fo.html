fled my government office building, stripping off my tie and heading in <br/>
direct pursuit of the Creature of Fountainhead Park. I've been anxious <br/>
to do this famous "Scooby Series" since I started this thing called <br/>
Letterboxing back in January,  but had assumed it was off limits as the <br/>
park was closed for the season. Even by changing clothes at traffic <br/>
signals, I didn't reach the trail in time to find the whole series <br/>
before darkness chased me from the park. (And you have to enter and <br/>
exit through an old cemetery at that!) I did find Scooby, Velma &amp; <br/>
Daphne. Fred and Shaggy will have to wait for another day.<br/>
<br/>
But three finds on a weeknight is "ok" <br/>
<br/>
Thank You Knights of Colombo!</div>
