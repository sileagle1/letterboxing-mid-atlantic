Need advice<br/><br/>The Mountain Road series are very nice; neat history and nice boxes--easy to find with good stamps. There are four sets, with Crump Park holding multiple boxes. We had a blast and the park is beautiful. I would definitely put it high on my to-do list. When we searched (last fall) the Courtney Road Gas Station box was missing but I understand it's been replaced.<br/>ChilePepper<br/><br/>----- Original Message ----- <br/>From: trainear@... <br/>To: lbma@yahoogroups.com <br/>Sent: Wednesday, April 13, 2005 10:13 AM<br/>Subject: [lbma] Richmond area boxes? Need advice<br/><br/><br/>I'll be Virginia too in a week or so.<br/>We have a family wedding in Richmond on April 23.<br/>I may have some brief opportunities to box, but they need to be quickly accessible or I will be left behind by my family.<br/>Anybody have some suggestions
 for me?<br/>Thanks,<br/>Raindear<br/><br/><br/>Hello,<br/>I have to travel to Virginia Beach for a convention 06-08 MAY. I hope to <br/>squeeze in a few letterboxes. Are there any "must do" letterboxes, or any close <br/>to the Cavalier Hotel?<br/><br/>Thanks,<br/>FamilyMan<br/><br/></p></blockquote></span></blockquote></div><p>
