                    <div id="ygrps-yiv-1499109091">last week and this. I planted a box last week.  Where are the clues? <br/>
Weeellll...there aren't any. I put one box in this "park" and went<br/>
back the next day to plant another only to find a gate across the<br/>
trailhead. Inquired inside the building and was told that there is now<br/>
a $5 fee for park use. Five! Zero to five? There are two short trails,<br/>
a small lake (to look at, no use allowed) picnic tables, etc. I paid<br/>
my money and picked up my box.<br/>
<br/>
Thought I'd check out a little lake on the edge of a forest, paved<br/>
roads nearby. I drove along a road which approached the lake, the<br/>
pavement ended and by the time I realized it was too late...it was too<br/>
late. The road turned left, then right as it went downhill filled with<br/>
potholes and depressions as it narrowed. At 1/2 mile I reaced an<br/>
intersecting road. I couldn't bring myself to turn around and go back<br/>
the way I'd come so, onward it was. Sand, mud, puddles, small lakes,<br/>
the road was just barely above the surrounding flooded swamp in areas.<br/>
Three miles and about an hour and I was back in civilization. I've<br/>
never been so glad to see pavement before.<br/>
<br/>
I went out yesterday to hund instead and, wanna guess, didn't find the<br/>
box.<br/>
<br/>
Things will only get better. They have to, they couldn't get worse,<br/>
could they?</div>
