Sorry....more specifically, there is a new 6 box series planted on <br/>
Sugarloaf Mtn., there are several boxes in Boyds in Black Hills <br/>

six miles!  We did it, though, we conquered the Pinnacle and are happy<br/>
to report that we found all three boxes and True Indigo and RGBisMe<br/>
also managed to find two geocaches.   Pulpit Rock and Pulpit Rock<br/>
Observatory were in fine shape - we were first finders on the<br/>
Observatory box.  Not so good news about the Pinnacle box though, it<br/>
had been damaged by critters and the log book was thoroughly soaked. <br/>
True Indigo had repair supplies stashed in her bag and we replaced the<br/>
log book and the damaged box.<br/>
<br/>
It was an absolutely perfect day for hiking, wonderful hiking<br/>
partners, cool enough to keep a jacket on all day, beautiful sunshine<br/>
and absolutely stunning views.  Walking to the Pinnacle has been an<br/>
item on my "100 things I must do in my lifetime" list and I am now<br/>
thrilled that I can check it off as completed.  I have never been so<br/>
tired in my life but felt so good before.<br/>
