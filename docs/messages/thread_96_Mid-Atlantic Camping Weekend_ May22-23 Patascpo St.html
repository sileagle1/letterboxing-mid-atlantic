                    <div id="ygrps-yiv-1262810032"><div>What a wonderful time I had!! Thanks so much to Celtic Pride for hosting this event. In addition to the aforementioned Celtic Pride and Hikers &amp; Hounds (well...just me this time) also in attendance were The Doubtful Guests (Scarab, Night Owl and Tux - woof!) Schizokeet and her sherpas, Sewsowbizzy and several visitors stopped by for exchanges, Tempus Fugit, Dead Duck Chuck, Claire de Lune and Psychomommy!</div>
<div> Patascpo Stae Park is a beatiful park and it's huge! We had to drive to several areas BEFORE we could even begin hiking. I got there around 10:30 AM on Saturday and everyone was already out boxing. I pitched my tent, grabbed my backpack and clues and drove to the McKeldin area to search for some of the boxes there. I headed out to search for two boxes not far from each other. The clues on the first box included the phrase "see the V-Shaped tree at the top of the hill, take a 200 degree bearing, etc" Which I did and...no box. I checked all of the tress within a 100 foot diameter and no box.SO I hiked on and crested another hill and there was another V-Shaped tree! Same story, no box. I hiked further and found, you guessed it, another V-shaped tree atop a hill. This is when I realized the name Patascpo is obviously a Lenape Indian word meaning "Forest full of V-Shaped Trees". I gave up and hiked on to the Patascpo Valley Park box which had no V-shaped trees in the clues but
 did have one big honkin' spiker guarding it. My battle with the spider for the box was almost as epic as the battle of Samwise and Shelob. On my way back to my car I passed some folks on the trail and had to step off trail to let them by, that's when I spotted a tree I hadn't checked yet, and there was the first box I had given up on. After that I met up with everyone else back at camp we had lunch, went boxing some more than had a fabuolus dinner the highlight of which was sewsowbizzy's awesome hamburgers and Skizokeets banana boats. We played games and had a wonderful time. Sunday AM after we visited with Psychomommy for awhile  we boxed together some more before I decided it was time to skedaddle back north of the Mason-Dixon line. It was a great weekend and the Cicadas were a lot of fun. They were everywhere and it was really cool. So anyway, I am SO glad I dorve down for this event. Met some more really cool boxers,
 got some great boxes, thanks placers!, and did some neat exchanges. What a great weekend!</div>
