Off topic - Today Thomas (Kirby Rider or Thomas for those who have <br/>
met my little sidekick) did his last ever act in a Cub Scout Role.  <br/>
He moved up to Boy Scouts in late March and had qualified for the <br/>
Trexler District Pinewood Derby by winning our Pack's race in late <br/>
Feb.  His little Bro, Andy had come in 2nd.  Well, at the District <br/>
Race (made up of all the op finishers from like 30 packs), Andy came <br/>
in 25th/72 and Tom came in 4th/72!  Great Job Boys.<br/>
<br/>
We celebrated by eating some Rita's and clearing some brush in the <br/>
backyard (a red state thing in this blue state)  ;-).<br/>
<br/>
Take care,<br/>

I found Thomas to be an intelligent, interesting and polite <br/>
letterboxing companion when I met him in October. Mr.and Ms. <br/>
Lightnin'bug are doin' something right.<br/>
<br/>
After a Hairy Legged boxing excursion at the S.Jersey gathering last <br/>
October, Lightnin'bug said, "Thomas likes you (this is the good part) <br/>
I don't know why". That one broke me up for days.<br/>
Just so you know Rich, animals like me too. ;-) I tend to insult the <br/>
sensibilities of adult human beings. This explains much to many.<br/>

&gt; Off topic - Today Thomas (Kirby Rider or Thomas for those who have <br/>

&gt; He moved up to Boy Scouts in late March and had qualified for the <br/>
&gt; Trexler District Pinewood Derby by winning our Pack's race in late <br/>
&gt; Feb.  His little Bro, Andy had come in 2nd.  Well, at the District <br/>
&gt; Race (made up of all the op finishers from like 30 packs), Andy <br/>
came <br/>
&gt; in 25th/72 and Tom came in 4th/72!  Great Job Boys.<br/>

&gt; &gt; Okay, okay, okay..... I know carving has been discussed before.  <br/>
&gt; Frequently.  But..... I have a quick question.  Where can you get <br/>
&gt; the pink stuff.  I have tried all kinds of stuff (I was lucky and <br/>
&gt; won the prize at the South Jersey meet last year that had several <br/>
&gt; kinds of carving material so I have gotten to try lots of different <br/>
