                    <div id="ygrps-yiv-2000345118">I have not found any of the Milan Classic at Dollar Tree Northern VA <br/>
(that'll be at the two stores I've looked in.)  And I have bought <br/>
several other brands but they all leaked UNTIL yesterday, I got <br/>
TONTARELLI (made in Italy, they know the meaning of "don'ta spilla the <br/>
saucea")<br/>
<br/>
It passed the submarine test (paper towel, close, pounce this way and <br/>
that in a vat of water) and the towel came out 100% dry.  It is also <br/>
marked "-30 degrees C" so it might even hold up thru winter.  The lids <br/>
are opaque white or blue, bottom is clear.  The size is slightly <br/>
larger (6.5"sq x 3") than Milan (6"sq x 2.5") - so suitable for <br/>
housing HH's without jamming lid on.<br/>
<br/>
There were not a lot at the store, so I'll have to go buy them all.  <br/>
Although if I had a choice I would buy the Milan/Dougerware for the <br/>
size and pretty green lid.<br/>

enough.... just yesterday (4/16) I found "The Virginia Rail".... in <br/>
none other than Tontarelli! The Virginia Rail was planted by "The Mad <br/>
Piper" in November 2000..(!). adopted by Scarab... visited by myself <br/>
yesterday... the first stamp in the logfor two years... possibly <br/>
because the local critters have been moving it around (!).... I found <br/>
it out in the open twenty yards from where it was supposed to be... <br/>
upside down... with Scarab's blessing I have pulled it for a little <br/>
rehab. The log was a bit damp,so I will dry it out completely then add <br/>
a new log and rebag everything.... but considering the age and the way <br/>
it was found... the Italian Box is good stuff!</div>
