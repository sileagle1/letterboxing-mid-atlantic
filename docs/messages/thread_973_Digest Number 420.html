<div>Rich,</div>
<div>Congrats on the Boy Scout move up.  (I'm an Eagle scout and still remember fondly the many activities I did as a scout).  </div>
<div>My girls were in the Pinewood Derby back in february (YMCA Adventure Guides).  We managed 3rd and 5th this year out of ~65. </div>
<div> </div>
<div>I use E-Z Cut from Dick Blick.</div>
<div> </div>
<div><br/><blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; <br/>&gt; <br/>&gt; The fave of us frugal Hairy Leggers is the Grey Stuff from Dick <br/>&gt; Blick. It is available in 11x17 sheets that are about 1/4" thick <br/>&gt; (will need backing unless a small stamp) for about $12. It is <br/>&gt; unofficiallyu endorsed by Cichlid Guy, Cyclonic and Lightnin' Bug. <br/>&gt; It is said to impart Mapsurfer solving capabilities. ;-) <br/>&gt; <br/>&gt; Off topic - Today Thomas (Kirby Rider or Thomas for those who have <br/>&gt; met my little sidekick) did his last ever act in a Cub Scout Role. <br/>&gt; He moved up to Boy Scouts in late March and had qualified for the <br/>&gt; Trexler District Pinewood Derby by winning our Pack's race in late <br/>&gt; Feb. His little Bro, Andy had come in 2nd. Well, at the District <br/>&gt; Race (made up of all the op finishers from like 30 packs), Andy came <br/>&gt; in 25th/72 and Tom came in 4th/72! Great Job Boys. <br/>&gt; <br/>&gt; We celebrated by eating some Rita's and clearing some brush in the <br/>&gt; backyard (a red state thing in this blue state) ;-). <br/>&gt; <br/>&gt; Take care, <br/>&gt; <br/>&gt; LB <br/>&gt; <br/> </span></blockquote></div></html></div>
