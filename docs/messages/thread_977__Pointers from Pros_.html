Fountainhead Series (Part II)... so I called in an outside <br/>
consultant... Wanda of Rhode Island made a special trip in to assist <br/>
me in my "Spacekook" / "10,000 Volt Monster" dilemna. I thought one <br/>
was out of place and one was missing .... but Ms Wanda (7,000 Found <br/>
but hey who's counting?) quickly showed me the error of my ways and to <br/>
borrow the motto of The Alphabet Bandits.... "Secundum Praeceptum" or  <br/>
Follow the Directions!!!<br/>
<br/>
An honor to have walked the trail with you.... thanks for the assist <br/>
on the 10K Volt Monster<br/>

ps It was alo a real treat to meet someone who had been on National <br/>
Public Radio!</div>
