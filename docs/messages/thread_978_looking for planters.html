                    <div id="ygrps-yiv-1570303237">As you may know, I carved a whole bunch of stamps based on the tiles<br/>
on the floor of the PA State Capitol in Harrisburg. The tiles were<br/>
made by Henry Chapman Mercer's famous tileworks in Doylestown.<br/>
Unfortunately, I only got to plant a few of them before we moved to<br/>
CT. Since it doesn't make any sense to plant these stamps outside of<br/>
PA, and we're not going to get back there often enough to plant 9 more<br/>
letterboxes, I was wondering if anyone<br/>
would each be interested in planting one of these boxes in the state<br/>
as a team effort with Jennifer and me. We've already carved the<br/>
stamps, made the logbooks, and put it all together in a letterbox --<br/>
if you'd like to volunteer, we'll send one to you, you can plant it<br/>
and then write the clues for it.<br/>
<br/>
I did plant three in SE PA, so it would be great if some of them could<br/>
get planted elsewhere in the state.<br/>
<br/>
Anyone interested?<br/>
