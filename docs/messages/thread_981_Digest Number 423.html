<div>Doug,</div>
<div>I was going to volunteer to plant a few here, to keep your other ones company, but if you want them scattered over the state that's understandable.</div>
<div>If you don't get enought takers, let me know.</div>
<div>I can go out a bit into Berks county.</div>

The tiles were <br/>&gt; made by Henry Chapman Mercer's famous tileworks in Doylestown. <br/>&gt; Unfortunately, I only got to plant a few of them before we moved to <br/>&gt; CT. Since it doesn't make any sense to plant these stamps outside of <br/>&gt; PA, and we're not going to get back there often enough to plant 9 more <br/>&gt; letterboxes, I was wondering if anyone <br/>&gt; would each be interested in planting one of these boxes in the state <br/>&gt; as a team effort with Jennifer and me. We've already carved the <br/>&gt; stamps, made the logbooks, and put it all together in a letterbox -- <br/>&gt; if you'd like to volunteer, we'll send one to you, you can plant it <br/>&gt; and then write the clues for it. <br/>&gt; <br/>&gt; I did plant three in SE PA, so it would be great if some of them could <br/>&gt; get planted elsewhere in the state. <br/>&gt; <br/>&gt; Anyone interested? <br/>&gt; <br/>&gt; Doug <br/>&gt; <br/>&gt; <br/>&gt; ________________________________________________________________________ <br/>&gt; ________________________________________________________________________ <br/>&gt; <br/></blockquote></span></blockquote></html>
