Date: Saturday, May 14, 2005<br/>
Place: Black Hill Regional Park, Pavilion J<br/>
	http://www.mc-<br/>
mncppc.org/parks/facilities/regional_parks/blackhill/index.shtm<br/>
20930 Lake Ridge Dr., Boyds (Germantown), MD<br/>
Time: 11 a.m. until 4 p.m.<br/>
<br/>
I have reserved a large pavilion with easy access to restrooms and a <br/>
playground. Furry friends on leashes are welcome. (There is a dog <br/>
playground in the park.) <br/>
<br/>
Charcoal fires and hotdogs/rolls will be provided (or you may bring <br/>
something to throw on a grill). Attendees are asked to bring a <br/>
potluck dish to share. If you would rather bring canned soft drinks <br/>
instead of potluck, please contact me! (Sorry, Poison Ivy, but <br/>
alcoholic beverages are prohibited.)<br/>
<br/>
Black Hill Park is a few miles off Interstate 270, exit 18. In <br/>
addition to a large lake, there are over 3 miles of paved trails and <br/>
10 miles of unpaved trails, accessible to hikers, mountain bikers <br/>
and horseback riders. There are currently 29 listed letterboxes <br/>
hidden in the park and many more within a short driving distance. <br/>
Print out clues for Boyds, Germantown, Damascus, Gaithersburg, <br/>
Hyattstown (all in Montgomery County, MD).<br/>
<br/>
I will need a rough headcount, so please email me <br/>
(donnas28@...) or rsvp on AtlasQuest.com if you plan to attend. <br/>
<br/>
Camping is available nearby at Little Bennett Regional Park. <br/>
