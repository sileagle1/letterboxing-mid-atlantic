I second Hiker &amp; noHound's enthusiastic report on the weekend. Was <br/>
really glad to see Psychomommy, Tempus Fugit, Dead Duck Chuck and <br/>
Claire de Lune who didn't camp but stopped by.<br/>
<br/>
Night Owl and I are determined to go back and find the cave <br/>
letterbox, site of the infamous bird attack.  Somone want to tell <br/>
that story?<br/>
<br/>
Was very interested to see Hall's stamp marked PFX200 in <br/>
Psychomommy's Rufus box.<br/>
<br/>
Many thanks for the shared food as Night Owl and I only managed to <br/>
get out the door with a tent and a sleeping bag.  Mesquite grilled <br/>
burgers and a grande breakfast.  <br/>

Many thanks to Celtic Pride for getting us together.<br/>

the point that my exchange count is almost equal to my found count. I <br/>
really have a hard time deciding what I enjoy more, meet/greets or <br/>
hunting. The thrill is the same. <br/>
   Hope to see you again, happy hunting,<br/>
