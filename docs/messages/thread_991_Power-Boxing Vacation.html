with friend (The Gamecock).  The trip began on 4-16-05 in Atlanta, GA <br/>

<br/>
Even with all of our Power-Boxing we did find time for some typical <br/>
tourist activities-such as shopping, snorkeling and the like.  <br/>
However, with the boxing we were able to experience some atypical <br/>
activities.  We were able to come up close and personal with a <br/>
curious Key deer who was attracted by our flashlight and head lamp <br/>
which we used for boxing at night- the deer stood less then two feet <br/>
away watching over my shoulder- we were very pleased she decided not <br/>
to charge at us!  We also had to climb over a fence, as an escape, <br/>
after being locked in a park in Gainesville.  And, with the boxing <br/>
had the opportunity to see some gators we would have otherwise missed <br/>
along our travels.</div>
