                    <div id="ygrps-yiv-36165629"><div>I spent yesterday afternoon down at the local constabulary trying to explain away the public decency's law's against the arrival of our new, heart stopping, "Peep Show" (by Natty Bumpo). Much to my complete embarassment, members of the press were present, along with local representatives of the Ladies Auxillary with their own objections. After private consultations with some of the authorities, that involved the exchange of several free passes, a loophole was discovered and we shall be allowed to proceed. Not before we gained priceless free publicity.
<div> </div>
<div>Speaking of the curious public, I returned to our camp to discover the arrival of the "Amazing Tattooed Woman" (by Kreepi Kelli) surrounded by shocked "Sideshow Gawkers" (by Drew Clan). She is truly a marvel to behold, so I cannot blame their admiration. These gawkers are so two faced though. Rotate them 180 degrees and they show a completely different side of themselves. You won't believe your eyes.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Last week I carved myself a new top hat and tails for my "Ringmaster" outfit (by Scarab). I was quite pleased with the affect if I do say so myself. </div>
<div> </div>
<div>Yesterday I was lucky enough to preview our fine "Elephant and Boch's Circus Banner" (by Tempus Fugit). In her new finery she is simply splendid. Ready to lead our parade down Main Street. Everyone will come out and follow us.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Speaking of the parade I have completed new carving and repainting of our "Steam Caliope Wagon" (by Scarab). They will hear us coming!</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Speaking of coming, both "Madame Natascha: the Black Widow" (by Gallant Rogue), and our "Juggler" (by Music Woman), arrived by train. I was very amused to watch the train station crowd separate themselves into one crowd of women and children, and another of gentlemen. You can guess which was which. For myself I could not help but admire the amazing quality of both performances. </div>
<div> </div>
<div>I have heard from many who are getting their performances together or are in transit. It is with excited anticipation that I await more arrivals. Many thanks for all efforts. </div>
<div> </div>
<div>Rehearsals On!</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Yours most truly and sincerely, your humble Ringmaster,</div>
