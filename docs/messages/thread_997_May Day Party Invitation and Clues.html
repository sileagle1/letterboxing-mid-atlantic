Did any of you see SpaceTraveler's post to the main list on Monday <br/>
about a May Day Party this coming Sunday? Well, I emailed Judy and <br/>
here is her response. She asked me to send along the invitation to <br/>
this list and included the first set of clues to get there. Here's <br/>
what she wrote . . .<br/>
<br/>
"It's not so much of a letterbox gathering but an afternoon party <br/>
with Maypole, bonfire and a letterbox to find at my house near the <br/>
Lehigh Valley. I'll send clues out later this week. Party starts at <br/>
3PM and will go until probably about 8 PM. Bring munchies/drinkables <br/>
and plan to hang out with us.<br/>
<br/>
Please pass my invitation on to the Mid Atlantic boxers.<br/>
<br/>
Here is the first set of clues:<br/>
<br/>
Find the Knechts Bridge and head West 2 miles. <br/>
Look for signs of May merry making on the right.<br/>
Query the dog<br/>

Below is the original post on the main list . . .<br/>
<br/>
From: "Judi Space" &lt;<a href="mailto:Judi@..." rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Judi@...</a>&gt;<br/>
For any boxers out and about in Eastern PA, be advised that there is <br/>
a May Day Party with Event Stamp and letterbox on Sunday (May 1) <br/>
after 3 PM. Boxers are invited to hunt the box and join us for <br/>
burgers, dogs, bonfire, maypole etc. Please email me off list for <br/>
more info. SpaceTraveler</div>
