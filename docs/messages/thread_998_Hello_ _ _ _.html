Got the second and third dinosaurs in the Jurassic series. Ran into <br/>
another pair of letterboxers at the second box and we all found it <br/>
together. That was fun, since I'd seen his stamp around in the area. <br/>
And so we debunk the rumor floating up this way that said box is <br/>
missing. Hard to find, but not missing.<br/>
