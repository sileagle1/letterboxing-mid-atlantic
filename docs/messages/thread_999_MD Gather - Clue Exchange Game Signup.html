                    <div id="ygrps-yiv-119983947"><div>Attention!  Attention please!  Something terrible has happened. "Someone talked you into running the Clue Exchange Game again?" "Shush."  As you know, last week Mr. Boddy hosted our Boch's Circus on the extensive grounds of his country estate.  It was wonderfully grand of him to pay.. um, I mean to invite us to entertain his guests.  </div>
<div> </div>
<div>The local constabulary has just informed me that Mr. Boddy has been murdered!  Because of the party, the detective informs me the suspects could be one of the guests or any of the circus people.  Not that I believe for a moment that the murderer could possibly be one of our fine troupe.  We asked to provide any information, memories, interesting gossip, or anything that might lead to the discovery of the murderer.  </div>
<div> </div>
<div>Detective Grogue has provided me with a list of the usual suspects:</div>
<div> </div>
<div>SUSPECTS: Colonel Mustard, Miss Scarlet, Mr. Green, Mrs. Peacock, Professor Plum, Mrs. White</div>
<div> </div>
<div>WEAPONS: Knife, Rope, Lead Pipe, Candlestick, Wrench, Revolver, Poison, Magnifying Glass</div>
<div> </div>
<div>PLACES: Lounge, Kitchen, Dining Room, Conservatory, Ballroom, Billiard Room, Study, Library, Hall</div>
<div> </div>
<div>If any you fine citizens wish to help in solving this inconvenient.. I mean terrible crime, please contact me immediately.  </div>
<div> </div>
<div>Phineas Boch, Ringmaster of Boch's Circus</div>
<div>------------</div>
<div>Rules and Information:</div>
<div> </div>
<div>I have in hand the 23 original classic Clue clues.  I will post a sign up sheet at the gather for those who want to play and use these stamps on a first come first served basis.  </div>
<div> </div>
<div>However you are welcome, and I encourage you, to carve your own stamp to play with.  Just PLEASE let me know ahead of time that you wish to play, and what you are going to carve, so I can be prepared with enough supplies, and more important, prepare the Clue clues sheet for people to check off and play with.  I have to print up a list of clues ahead of time as check off sheets for the game players.  Also I will advise of duplicates.  You may carve any appropriate clue: people, weapons, or places, put please keep to either the circus or the mansion theme.  </div>
<div> </div>
<div>Later, an agenda with a starting time will be posted.  </div>
<div><br/>CLUE Game Exchange Rules:<br/>--------------------------</div>
<div>- The object of the game is to determine what Suspect killed Mr. Boddy, with what Weapon, in what Room of the mansion.  The first to make this correct accusation to the Clue Master (in this case the Ringmaster) wins.  This is very much like the regular Clue rules except that instead of questions and cards you are collecting stamps to eliminate the innocent.  </div>
<div>- When you ask someone for a regular exchange, also ask, "Do you have a Clue?"  If they have a Clue clue they stamp it into your log along with their exchange.  </div>
<div>- Mark off what stamps you receive on your Clue sheet.  Eventually you will find that one Suspect, Weapon, and Place are missing.  Then you are ready to make your accusation.  </div>
<div> </div>
<div>- All stamp entries must be in by 11am.<br/>- I will put all entries in plain envelopes by type, and shuffle and choose the answer as per standard Clue rules.  </div>
<div>- At the starting time I will shuffle and pass out all of the rest of the envelopes to those who have signed up.  (If you carved a stamp you probably would not end up using it to exchange with.)<br/>- Keep track of what you receive on the Clue clue sheets (study it carefully.)<br/>- Make an Accusation, as per Clue rules, to me at any time.  Except that unlike Clue, I will check for the correct answer (so noone accidently blurts any information out).  </div>
<div>- I will not announce a winner until I have 1st, 2nd, and 3rd entries.  </div>
<div>- To prevent stamps being withheld accidently, the winner must show that a large number of players has received his or her stamp.  I will ask for a show of hands of how many have the hopeful winner's clue stamp.  If there are too few then the win may pass to the 2nd placer.  This is to prevent a win by someone inadvertantly withholding their own stamp while getting other's. <br/>- The first place winner receives a copy of the game, upon which we all will stamp the Clue stamps on the inside of the box cover.<br/>- I hope that all stamps will be donated to become part of the traveling event set to play at other events, or to run away with the Circus.</div>
<div>- The Clue Master is the final arbiter of all questions.  </div>
